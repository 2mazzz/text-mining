1087,Rez,9.0,2,"Rez Infinite, the updated remake designed for the PlayStation 4 and PSVR, is still the same game as the original Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 version, albeit with a little more visual flourish. Backgrounds that were once hazy have been replaced with updated, crystal clear pieces of the cyberworld. Colors are brighter, lines sharper. Enemies drift in and out of your field of view with a new smoothness. And in VR, Rez Infinite allows you to dive deeper into its world in ways previously impossible.To navigate Rez, you need only concern yourself with aiming and shooting, as you remain on rails moving at a set speed at all times. While holding down the X button you use the left stick--or in VR, the headset's motion tracking--to highlight the enemy or enemies with a targeting reticle, then release the button to fire your shot. Rez encourages you to chain hits together by cluttering your field of view with opponents, making picking them off one by one not an option. And this isn't as simple as it sounds, given enemies come flying at you from every direction at all once, and that's not even counting the additional projectiles they toss your way. Shooting sounds are replaced with claps or beats, and successfully destroying enemies results in a flood of musical tones. You can pick off your opponents in time with the beat, or create your own discordant melodies--it's entirely up to your own rhythm.Occasionally you'll collect clusters of bright white and blue pixels that allow you to charge up. Collect enough of these and you level up, taking on a new form--for example, at one stage you evolve from a floating silver figure to a red and black figure seated cross-legged within a sphere. Additionally, collecting these white pixels and rare red ones charges up your Overdrive, a powerful attack that can clear the screen of enemies in seconds and comes especially handy during a boss encounter.When rushing bosses, you must locate and target the core object of an undulating, vibrating cluster of tiles and lights to dismantle one area of the cyberspace prison. These are the most complex and challenging sections of Rez, and often include multiple stages. One boss collects squares around its core and takes on the form of a running figure that chases you through hallways. Another is a swirling sphere, with tentacle-like arms that break up and try to whip you as you fly by. These boss battles are also a visual treat, and with Rez Infinite's upgraded graphics it feels more like attending a rave in Tron than a fight.And then there's Area X. Rez isn't about shooting and conquering, it's about creating music. And nowhere is this concept stronger than in a new mode unlocked after completing all five main campaign areas. Area X removes the rails and sets you off into space, allowing you to fly in any direction you wish. In doing this, Rez Infinite grants you more power in manipulating your space; you can fly closer to or away from enemies, skirt around giant structures shimmering in the surrounding darkness, or simply fly around in circles and let the beat play out around you. You can maneuver around the space in a way that lines up enemies and objects exactly how you want them, then unleash a torrent of tones following your own rhythm. I played through Area X several times and never found the same rhythm twice--going after the pink, squid-like enemies and leaving a giant flying dragon-like creature alone for a while produced a different sound that when I went directly for the dragon and followed it around the space, a tiny silvery shadow in its starry wake.But playing the game in VR places Rez in what feels like its final form. In the original areas one through five, as you glide through these cyberspaces, you can look up, down, and behind you for a greater view of the world you inhabit. This new freedom of movement for your field of vision also allows you a second chance at enemies that have floated out of your path; in several cases being able to look directly behind me assisted in my takedown of a boss. This wider field of movement lets you more quickly dispatch enemies, and in this way it makes the game a bit easier (especially that pesky running boss).But Area X in VR is the perfect coupling. I spent time flying off in the stars and gazing down on the musical chaos below me, before rocketing down and zipping between shiny pink projectiles as I moved in to pick off a particularly large enemy that dropped the beat as it dissipated into nothing. This feels like the natural evolution of Rez, and I have to imagine this could be how creator Tetsuya Mizuguchi saw his creation from the beginning. The full sensory immersion elicits a sensation beyond the simple toe-tapping and head-bobbing that comes from playing the original Rez. Rez Infinite's Area X in VR engages your entire body, thumping your synapses in time with the music and forcing you to move. I felt connected to my tiny being on screen, doling out a symphony with fireworks in my wake."
1141,Cosmic Star Heroine,6.0,1,"Agent Alyssa L'Salle is a beret-wearing, bo-wielding covert ops specialist for the government who spends much of the game unraveling a large-scale conspiracy. Within minutes of being introduced, she's defusing bombs, hacking computers, and getting into harrowing fights with flying drones while clambering up the side of a skyscraper. She's almost cartoonishly cool and competent, as are her companions. It may seem a little over the top at first glance, but it's part of what cements the game's vibe as a pulpy, joyously unfettered throwback. Pop stars, tech experts, monk-like gunslingers, and literal dancing machines--Cosmic Star Heroine is far from shy about letting its cast shine every bit as brightly as its lead.The game is also a little more than standard turn-based RPG fare. Each character's abilities can only be used once, with the exception of a handful. While the majority can be restored by using a character's recharging/guard move, certain powerful abilities, as well as equipped items, can only be used once per battle.Added to this are Style and Hyper Points. Style accumulates over time and offers a boost to allies and enemies alike, so the longer a battle takes, the more devastating each strike becomes. Hyper Points, meanwhile, are accumulated with each turn and are represented as little pips under a character's health bar. Fill in the requisite number of pips and the character unlocks the damage-doubling Hyper Mode for their turn.That's a lot to take in at first, but the end result is that combat has an extra layer of strategy beyond what you might initially expect. If an enemy is weak to water, for instance, there's a massive advantage to saving one of Alyssa's water abilities until she's in Hyper Mode to get the most out of it, especially if a few turns have already passed and she's had a chance to accumulate some Style as well.In general, this system encourages good habits and thoughtful fighting. This is especially true in Hyper Mode, which encourages you to be a lot more diligent about considering your entire repertoire of moves and making big, flashy strikes really count. At lower difficulty levels, these mechanics have little chance to shine, but since the difficulty can be adjusted at any point in the game, it's easy to experiment and find the exact level of challenge that suits your play style.No matter what difficulty is selected, Cosmic Star Heroine clearly doesn't want to be a grind. Alyssa moves from dystopian city to alien planet to swanky mob banquet with plenty of fighting in between--but plenty of direction and purpose, too. The handful of alternate paths, hidden areas, and optional bosses seldom take her too far from the action or distract too much from the core objective, and they typically yield high-quality gear for her or her companions.As a result, you never feel like you're dragging your heels in any one location for long--but it also makes the individual events feel oddly abbreviated at times. Plots sometimes pivot and settings shift before you get a good sense of either. If the game dealt purely in tropes, this wouldn't matter, but Cosmic Star Heroine presents its own individual world, its own uniquely interesting characters, and its own blend of technology and the supernatural--and then provides you with almost no space to acclimate to any of it. Fast-paced action and intrigue can and should still allow for moments of downtime, flavor, or world-building. Even within the confines of short scenes, moments that could use a little time to breathe are awkwardly clipped. Hacking is instantaneous, as is subway transportation. These just happen, immediately and without fanfare--at its worst, it can feel like watching a movie at 1.5 times the normal speed.This is true even when it comes to the writing, which usually strikes a decent balance with its cheesiness. But every now and then Cosmic Star Heroine offers up a joke dampened by its own preemptive flop sweat. The style of its tone-setting minimalistic animated cutscenes is another case of the usually great being undermined by the occasionally awkward. Three-dimensional rendered models of ships and structures are sometimes slipped in alongside the hand-drawn elements, which has the effect of cheapening and fracturing an otherwise cohesive visual style.You will also find that Cosmic Star Heroine is peppered with slightly pettier annoyances as well. The biggest of these is the fact that there's no option to load the game from the system menu, so any time you want to test a different strategy or replay a section on a different difficulty setting, you have to close and restart the game. And strangely, some boss fights instantly resolve themselves under certain difficulty settings, but not always. Sometimes, one or two of the enemies would simply flee and reduce the opposing team's numbers, and sometimes a boss would simply concede before even a single turn passed.The dialogue trigger also seems to be incredibly sensitive, so even if you take extra care to press the button as lightly as possible, you may end up trapped in a loop of the same few lines from an NPC, unintentionally triggering the same text three or four times before breaking loose--an unfortunate and regular occurrence.With all of that said, Cosmic Star Heroine is still an enjoyable sci-fi RPG with a classical spirit. It's shameless in its celebration of its inspirations, and the soundtrack goes a long way to sell every moment. Though it has more than its fair share of flaws, none of that stops this game from being exactly what it sets out to be."
704,BoxBoy! + BoxGirl!,7.0,2,"BoxBoy! + BoyGirl! Is the biggest game in the series, featuring 270 levels across three different campaigns, though there is some repetition in puzzle motifs. Alongside single-player and co-op, there's also an unlockable mode featuring Qudy, a rectangular box person who can turn himself sideways and make boxes that are either tall or long depending on his orientation. Qudy's quest is a fun extra, and the developers find some cool ways to work his oblong shape into puzzles. Maneuvering his lanky frame through each level is an interesting new challenge, although he's given fewer exciting abilities than his other box pals.It's the co-op mode that represents the biggest shake-up in BoxBoy! + BoxGirl!, as two players can team up to solve puzzles that require BoxBoy and BoxGirl to work together. Each character has their own box limit and will often need to perform different tasks in different parts of the level to benefit one another. The extremely simple controls mean that you can comfortably play with one Joy-Con each (which is good because there's no online play), and good communication is essential so that you can share ideas and puzzle through scenarios together.The puzzles are easy enough that less experienced players won't come up against too many challenges--two series veterans will likely breeze through the campaign, although they'll have a good time doing so. Brilliantly, you can also play the whole co-op campaign alone, switching between the two characters. Features like this usually don't work so well in games built specifically for co-op, but it's a good fit for these puzzles, which never require simultaneous action from both boxes. With some of Bye-Bye BoxBoy's more inventive elements--such as different block types--having sadly been dropped, co-op is far and away the biggest highlight that this entry brings to the series.You earn two different currency when you complete levels, one of which can be spent on various bonuses--challenge levels, music to listen to, mostly unnecessary 'assist' items and lousy 'comic' panels--while the other can be spent on cute costumes and in-level hints. You can unlock more of each type of currency by completing levels with as few boxes as possible and by collecting the crowns that pop up in each of them, which represents the game's greatest challenge.Collecting crowns is inessential to your progress, and the extra currency they earn you isn't particularly important--it builds up fast just by completing levels--but I still found myself instinctively trying to collect all of them. Sometimes the crown placement will be unimaginative, requiring little effort to nab. But often you'll need to think outside the box (pardon the pun) and really ponder how you can use your boxes within the environment, and puzzle through uses for your abilities you had not considered, to reach them. Grabbing the crowns is frequently more rewarding than just finishing the level, although if you want to tick off your other objective and finish the level with few blocks used, it's often best to ignore the crowns, meaning that completionists might want to run through many levels twice.In some ways, this game feels like a reintroduction to the series, which is fair, since it's BoxBoy's Switch debut. If you've played the previous BoxBoy games, you know what you're getting here--it's more of the same, but with a cool new co-op mode and the minor twist to the format that Qudy introduces. That's enough--BoxBoy has always been a light snack of a game, and it remains a great game to slowly chip away at when you're not in the mood for anything too taxing. For newcomers, it's a great entry point into the series, and a good low-stakes puzzle game to relax with. While Bye-Bye BoxBoy! remains the pinnacle of the series, BoxBoy! + BoxGirl! is a more than worthy entry."
1397,Republique Remastered,8.0,2,"It begins with a plea for help. A close up on a teenage girl's panicked face, clandestinely whispering about being “erased."" Her name is Hope. You don't know why she's called you. You can't quite tell where she is. But you know she's frightened, and everything is horribly wrong. We know this not because some omniscient narrator fills us in on the world in Republique's opening scene but in the same way you get all your information in Republique, a way that few games offer: you observe. You explore.The truth about Hope's new surroundings is out there, on the walls, in the newspapers, on the voicemails scattered around the game. A foreboding “headmaster” sees all, assuring an unseen populace that all is still right with the world--except clearly it isn't.You're surrounded by guards, people are blathering on about manifestos, the dangers of information, and about the poisonous influence of a dead rebel named Daniel Zager, who sets the tone at the game's outset with a single quote: “I used to be angry at my government because I thought they weren't listening. Now I'm angry because I know they are.” We are in a world of lavish accommodations, a place that more resembles Xavier's School for the Gifted than any sort of prison, and yet all the other telltale signs of a stone cold prison are inescapable, and in full view.And so begins Republique, with a sense of supreme disquiet, and a constant, ongoing bewilderment. It's that bewilderment that drives the game onward and what keeps players guessing episode after episode through a mystery that's all too reticent to hand out the easy answers.The dystopian nightmare is a compelling veneer for a rather simple stealth game when it comes down to brass tacks, though. Once you break Hope out of her initial confinement cell, your task is simply to keep her out of the hands of the Prizrak, the private security stooges milling about, keeping Pre-Cals—that is, the children of Republique—in their place, locked up, and under control. You do this by hijacking the thousands of surveillance devices scattered around the place, Watch Dogs style, and guide Hope from hiding place to hiding place, just beyond the sight of the Prizrak, hacking every piece of electronics you can find, occasionally managing to improve your door access in the process. Republique's lineage shows here. Developer Camouflaj has a few Metal Gear Solid veterans working under its roof, and that game's stealth pedigree shows in the patrol patterns, Hope's hiding spots, and the more advanced reactions when the Prizrak spot Hope and give chase.The difference is that Hope doesn't have Snake's arsenal—or anything much at all really. Hope can pick up pepper spray, tasers, and a landmine that puts Prizrak to sleep. She can even pickpocket from the Prisrak if she's clever. But for every item Hope picks up to just barely fend off being caught, the Prizrak get taser-proof armor and nerve gas. It's in character for the game at least, since Hope is definitely shown to be a naïve character who wouldn't know anything about the subtle arts of murder and persuasion. But it means often feeling like Hope is hideously outnumbered and outgunned.Or at least it would if getting caught meant death, or punishment, or higher security. Instead, losing means getting marched hands-up to the nearest confinement cell (which are, essentially, the game's save rooms), waiting for the guard to leave so you can bust Hope out. For a place that seemingly wants Hope dead, and has no problem with putting the boots to anyone who disobeys, they seem to handle Hope the way you would a bratty 4 year old, and it works every time. It doesn't make sneaking any less fun, and arguably, the infinite retries are often a blessing, considering the amount of backtracking you already have to do, but it does mess with the game's immersion.The game’s interface has been heavily redesigned to take full advantage of the DualShock4.Indeed, breaking the hypnotic, curious spell the game can cast when its doling out more of the mystery is its biggest problem. Ironically, the Playstation 4 version’s greatest technical success lends a hand to its greatest failure. The mobile and PC ports strictly kept the player as an omniscient voyeur, whose all-seeing eye jumped around the facility, whose touch/cursor led Hope every step of the way to freedom. For PS4, the game’s interface has been heavily redesigned to take full advantage of the DualShock4, with camera jumps now context sensitive, with buttons assigned to elements in the environment, Mark of Kri-style.This also allows the player full control over Hope using the left analog stick instead of just pointing her to the next location. On the positive side, except for an occasional stickiness when leaving cover, Hope’s movements are appropriately responsive and simple to latch onto, making stealth all the more intuitive. The problem is the dissonance that comes with now being in full control over someone who still consistently asks for your assistance during gameplay--it essentially robs her of hard-won agency in the process.The hits to immersion don't stop there. When jumping from camera to camera, you have the ability to read detailed files on each of the guards, which would be a nifty touch, one that pays off in spades in the third episode, if not for the fact that most of the guards' files have a giant “Kickstarter backer” stamp under their country's flag, and often references their gamer identities. Early on, you start getting additional assistance from another Prizrak guard who calls and offers advice and information in emojis and a robotic voice. He's a strong character, whose role in the facility gets pieced together bit by bit, and who just so happens to have floppy disks referencing fellow indie developers and Playstation exclusives scattered all around the place as collectables. The game certainly has supporters in high places who deserve their tips of the hat, but placing those smirking nods so shortly after Hope sees her first dead body, or after watching Republique's media branch destroy a man's reputation feels wholly out of place.It's only a stumbling block considering how great of a job the game does in world-building for such extended periods of time. For most of Republique, our eyes and ears are just as innocent as Hope's, and every new room is ripe with opportunities to learn something new, to fit a new piece of the puzzle on what we know about the Headmaster's plans and ambitions, the rampant, terrifying censorship and moralizing, the journalism-turned-propaganda-machine the failed, hostile attempts by Republique brass to engage the leaders of the free world. The stellar voice cast keeps us engaged from minute one, with every hackable device giving us brief, audio-only glimpses of the outside world and Republique's black-hat inner workings.Where Republique's gameplay is satisfyingly simple, the plot driving it on is anything but.At the center of it all, literally, and metaphorically, there's just Hope: a frightened girl who just wants to see the world outside Republique, not realizing just what kind of world she’s trying to work her way back into. She definitely finds out through the course of Republique’s five episodes. It's worrisome stuff that threatens to absolutely ruin a girl who we're already forced to tread lightly with in the early going. One of the few moral choices in the game involves that very idea, of how much Hope can bear. Though Episode 4 is a disappointing regression to point-and-click adventure game ideas that have long been rendered obsolete, the answers are abundant, frightening, and more than a little on the ambitious side when the game comes to its climax. Its pedigree as the offspring of Metal Gear Solid veterans is never so pronounced as it is when Republique crescendos, and it more than outshines the relative coyness of the first three episodes. Where Republique's gameplay is satisfyingly simple, the plot driving it on is anything but.Needless to say, despite its mobile game roots, the world of Republique is meant to immerse, to beckon the player's curiosity, and to involve them enough in the city-state's ins and outs enough to get Hope out of danger. In transitioning to consoles, the game remains largely successful at that."
901,Yoku's Island Express,9.0,2,"Metroid-style platformers have become more common recently, which makes standing out from the pack a daunting task for new games in that style. Yoku’s Island Express overcomes this hurdle by creatively combining both Metroid-style exploration and pinball mechanics into one unique product. This combination sounds unusual at first, but the final result is a charming, delightful, and wonderfully satisfying hybrid.You play as Yoku, a cute little beetle who has a ball attached to his hip with a string, and it's his first day as postmaster on Mokumana Island. The story is cute and straightforward, and there’s a large amount of backstory sprinkled throughout the game, but it doesn’t take long for the rest of Yoku’s Island Express’ beautiful game design to quickly take the spotlight.The world of Mokumana Island is gorgeous, and the delightful painterly art style realizes each of the game's different stages with vibrancy--lush jungles and dark labyrinths blend in seamlessly with stunning snow-covered mountains and underground caves, and the background scenery is just as beautifully detailed as the foreground. Every environment is perfectly accompanied by sound design which gives everything a cheery and quirky atmosphere, and the charming background music keeps things light and breezy throughout. The roster of supporting characters is also a delight to meet. Ranging from animals and plants to imaginary creatures, the large cast of NPCs are all amusing in their own ways. Some give you side quests, some give you exposition regarding the main story or island lore, and some are simply there for a quick quip or two.Yoku can only move left and right, and can't jump. However, flippers and platforms can be found all over Mokumana Island, which can be operated by using just two buttons, much like in pinball. These devices are all used to fling Yoku and his ball (which doubles as a pinball) in helpful directions to help you find and explore new paths of game’s cleverly branching world.If Yoku is the pinball, then Mokumana Island is a giant pinball table. One minute you could be strolling through the jungle, the next you might find yourself seamlessly dropped into a literal pinball puzzle carved out of the environment. Familiar pinball mechanics, like lanes and bumpers, are all there and completing these challenges will reward you with fruit (the game’s currency) and unlock additional paths around the island. Though the puzzles require precise timing demands, and there are many moments when your skills and reactions feel tested, no puzzle feels impossible. Most can be completed in only a handful of minutes, but there's a lot of variety to the boards which help keep the game incredibly engaging.Mokumana Island is surprisingly large, and filled with secrets and collectible items. A sprawling story quest and numerous side quests constantly push you in different directions, and there’s a lot of traveling and pinballing to be done. It’s also easy to get sidetracked from your tasks in favor of searching for the game's many secrets hiding within the beautiful island stages.Exploring becomes even more exciting as Yoku learns new, goofy abilities, which are used to overcome hurdles in a lighthearted fashion, like removing boulders using an exploding slug vacuum cleaner. These fun and practical abilities add extra layers of cheery personality to an already joyful game, and as common in the genre, they make you feel excited to backtrack and unlock previously inaccessible paths.Traveling back and forth from one end of Mokumana Island to the other can sometimes become tedious, however. A fast-travel system isn’t unlocked until later in the game, but even that is quite limited in regards to where you can and can’t travel. Some areas require you to complete a pinball puzzle in order to get from point A to B, which makes retreading quite repetitive and occasionally frustrating, particularly when the pinball puzzle is a complex one.Yoku’s Island Express takes two unlikely genres and combines them into one playful, natural experience. The game’s audio and visual design is simply joyous and the large game world seamlessly combines its pinball puzzles with some brilliant level designs. While traversing the large map does get frustrating at times, Yoku’s Island Express’ main quest never drags, and with its slate of fun abilities, quirky supporting characters and a generous amount of optional content, Yoku’s Island Express is a unique journey that’s refreshing and just straight up fun."
2280,The Walking Dead: A Telltale Games Series,7.0,2,"The Walking Dead: 400 Days is a fascinating exercise in rapid-fire storytelling. This is not the saga of Lee and Clementine, two characters whose relationship grew and evolved over the course of five episodes in The Walking Dead proper. No, this downloadable content is something altogether different: a brief collection of snapshots portraying characters who experience very different, very harrowing stories within the zombie-infested American South. At 20 or so minutes per character, these vignettes are lean endeavors that attempt to find a harmony between implied subtext and quick, punchy action. While I wish I could say that each of these stories succeeds at that task--two of them fall a bit flat--the best ones carry the slack with aplomb, making 400 Days a worthwhile experience for any fan of The Walking Dead. 400 Days opens with a bulletin board overrun with notes and photographs, desperate pleas from those who've been separated from their loved ones amid the zombie apocalypse. More than just a means to pull at your heartstrings right from the get-go, this board is also the interface that allows you to choose whose story you play next. It's a clever system: 400 Days allows you to determine the order in which these vignettes play out, letting you feel like you've taken an active role in the storytelling process before a story even begins. It helps that each character's vignette is a standalone story; there are hints and nods toward events from the full game, but they're hardly intertwined as a whole. The best of the bunch belongs to a woman named Shel, part of a group of survivors living life one day at a time within the walls of a well-maintained truck stop. Shel spends her days trying to shelter her younger sister Becca from the harsh realities of the outside world, but it all goes to hell when a stranger is caught stealing supplies and it's left to Shel whether to kill or release the man. That's not the only tough decision Shel faces in her chapter, creating a brief but powerful glimpse into the life of a woman who's forced to deal with very real threats while attempting to serve as a role model to her sister. Not far behind is the terrific story of Bonnie, a recovered drug addict caught in a love triangle with a married man. The affair is all but out in the open, each member resigned to the fact that there are far worse things in this devastated world than a little infidelity. But what begins as an awkward conversation between the three characters turns into something much worse when they're sent running through a dark corn field, shots firing at them from unseen strangers in the distance. The chapter ends with a heartbreaking tragedy and the need for you to choose your words very carefully in the wake of this event. To say any more would spoil things, but suffice it to say Bonnie's story is an excellent one. The quality of storytelling in 400 Days begins to taper off a bit from there, but Vince's story is still an interesting one. He's a convict shackled to his seat in a prison bus, engaged in the sort of idle trash talk you might expect among prisoners left with time to kill. When the bus hits a traffic jam, things go south in a hurry. Zombies make their way onto the bus, and Vince is left to make a tough decision over which of his not-quite-friends escapes and which is left behind. It's a tense situation, but one that doesn't reach its full potential given the fact that Vince is a dull character. Then you've got the other two stories, those of Randall and Wyatt. Randall is a young kid walking the deserted highways when he winds up getting picked up by an unhinged lunatic driving a truck. But nothing much happens other than awkward chatter; you don't learn much about Randall and the story just sort of fizzles out at the end. Wyatt's story follows a similar path. While there's some nice tension in the way Wyatt and a friend are sent driving through a foggy backroad trying to escape a maniacal driver, the exchanges between these two characters just kind of spiral around without going anywhere. It ends with one of the few action scenes in the entire DLC--Wyatt firing shots during a full-on chase scene--but the story rings hollow by the end, much like the limp epilogue that ties these vignettes together.  Yet the best stories in 400 Days are so good they're able to carry the DLC as a whole. Like The Walking Dead proper, this is an experience that makes for a powerful glimpse into the zombie apocalypse--not through gory action scenes but through the strained and heartbreaking interactions between characters caught in a terrible situation."
3518,Joe Danger,8.0,2,"          This is rather fortunate because even early on, some of the challenges are fiendishly difficult. Normal tour events cost a maximum of three stars to enter (with many costing just one) and reward between two and eight stars if all challenges are completed. These challenges take their inspiration from a number of other games and genres. Some are essentially platforming challenges, such as those that require you to collect a string of coins that only exist for a set period of time after you pick up the first one, collecting the letters that spell out danger, or hitting various targets spread throughout the level. Others feel more akin to something you'd have found in an early Tony Hawk game, requiring you to complete the level or one of the objectives without breaking your trick combo as you string aerial daredevil stunts together with wheelies.          This system is both fun and rewarding because you're never penalised for not pulling off a specific trick. However, pulling off specific complex stunts can be satisfying, as well as exceptionally profitable. This serves to encourage you to try to pull out outlandish stunts to outdo your PSN buddies but never makes the process punishing by tying in-game objectives to particularly outlandish antics. The social side of Joe Danger doesn't stop with bragging rights over high-scores, though. The game's full-featured level editor gives you the entire library of items, levels, and challenges that are found in the main game. It also lets you build single-player and multiplayer courses with real ease. You can test sections on the fly or just build tracks as you go--pressing the triangle button while flying through the air pulls you directly into the editor. This takes all the guesswork out of item placement because you can (for example) place targets where you land after having just done a backflip off your new ramp without needing to worry about it being impossible to hit.       "
3161,Hard Corps: Uprising,7.0,2,"is Contra…almost. This action-intensive 2D shooter dips heavily into the well of the classic shoot-'em-up series' past for inspiration, going so far as to feature character and story tie-ins to Contra: Hard Corps on the Sega Genesis. If the unmistakable opening prog-metal guitar riff and the frenzy of bullets that erupt from the get-go aren't a dead giveaway, the game's sadistic difficulty should be enough to jog your memory. Uprising adds a fail-safe or two to make its brutal eight-stage gauntlet of unending death somewhat playable for newcomers, but this retro throwback should come with a coupon for a free session of anger management classes.        This spiritual prequel to the similarly titled 1994 Sega Genesis game casts you in the reprised role of Colonel Bahamut, a former villain who has now taken to battling an evil empire of clown-masked soldiers and mechanical drones run by a futuristic dictator. Aside from a cool anime intro sequence, the story unfolds in brief text snippets that serve as a simple distraction during the game's lengthy loading screens. The Contra franchise has always been about raw arcade-style action, and Uprising doesn't disappoint in that department. You're dropped into the fray with guns blazing and offered immediate gratification as you run left and right, churning through droves of masked soldiers, flying robots, gun encampments, and nasty alien beasts. Familiar gun power-ups such as lasers, spread cannons, machine guns, rocket launchers, and flamethrowers help pleasantly speed foes to their graves. However, your own death rears its ugly head fast and frequently, even if you possess godlike reflexes. Some games are hard. Other games are ridiculously hard. Uprising's harsh difficulty curve manages to wildly overshoot such paltry levels of sadism and ventures instead into the magical realm of the purely ridiculous.     Each of the game's eight stages is lengthy and packed with minimal checkpoints and multiple boss battles. Successfully battling through the first level alone is a daunting task, and your threshold for anguish and frustration will determine which mode to play. Uprising's default Arcade mode is strictly for Contra purists. With meager health, three lives, and very little in the way of extra abilities, it offers an undiluted experience--one that makes you want to hurl your console through the TV screen. Rising mode is much more manageable. While it starts you out with limited health, only a few lives, and some basic abilities, every kill you make earns you points that can be spent unlocking new power-ups that help you push deeper into the game. You can buy extra lives, additional continues, more health, dash maneuvers, speed enhancements, and other crucial boosts. These upgrades take some of the sting out of plowing through a tough level only to die at the stage's last boss battle, since you keep your accumulated points until they're spent. A certain amount of grinding is required early on, but unlocking perks makes it a little easier to progress. Going alone is far more arduous than tackling the game with a friend in local or online two-player co-op. Playing with a teammate cuts down on a portion of the frustration. Having an extra gun on your side is useful on its own, though some of the trickier platforming stages later in the game require careful communication and near-perfect timing for both players to make it through in one piece.        A brisk challenge can be a great thing, but the insidious stage designs start off pretty brutal and grow exceptionally wickeder as you progress. This can make Uprising hard to stomach at times. Only one or two checkpoints are woven into the lengthy levels, and being forced to repeat a mid-stage boss battle you just struggled through because you ran out of lives only seconds after completing it is maddening. As spectacular as the boss encounters are, there are usually two or three per stage, and each boss often has multiple versions for you to defeat before it goes down for good. Regular enemies are no pushovers either. While common weaker foes take only a bit of your life away (and any weapon you have equipped), you encounter snipers that dish out one-hit kills, plants that spew life-draining poison, and other nastiness early on in the game. Things get worse from there. Throw in some sporadic platforming sections that require an inhuman level of precision, and it's tough to hold off the desire to snap the controller in half. Jumping back and forth to ride on detonating missiles rocketing upward through a massive elevator shaft is a very cool idea, but it's too difficult to be enjoyable. The grating metal soundtrack and awful voice-overs don't help when concentration is the key to your survival.      Despite its many cheap shots and frustrating moments, Uprising is a highly creative animal that changes constantly and keeps you on your toes. The beautiful hand-drawn art style has a pleasant anime vibe that updates the otherwise classic run-and-gun gameplay. Not only does each stage offer a stark visual contrast from the previous one, but they also throw in new and unexpected twists that break up the flow. Aside from hoofing it, you spend time riding a turbo-charged bike, battling away on a futuristic train network, boating along a river while blasting a giant mecha-sub, and riding missiles in space. While it'll probably be one of the most rage-inducing games you'll play this year, this Contra cousin rewards patient and skilled players with a nonstop glut of jaw-dropping, action-soaked moments.  "
3476,NCAA Football 10,8.0,2,"     Perhaps the biggest indicator of NCAA Football's drive to reward good play is the Season Showdown mode that functions as both a self-contained mode, as well as a feature you can turn on in other modes, such as Dynasty. This mode rewards you with points in various categories for accomplishing feats during the course of a game. For example, you can earn two skill points for executing a user tackle (which means the computer didn't provide any assistance) or several points for successfully running a specifically designated setup play where you run the same play a few times before faking out the defense with something different. To put it simply, picture running the ball up the middle several times before selecting a play-action pass play that fakes out the linebackers and defensive backs. Likewise, you can also earn points for good sportsmanship, such as punting on a fourth down--again, going back to the ""play the game the way it's meant to be played"" idea--but you can lose sportsmanship points for trying to run up the score on an opponent. While you can't actually participate in Season Showdown-specific competitions with other players until the start of the real college football season, there are leaderboards in place that serve as ample incentive to rack up those points as often as possible. And despite the fact that Season Showdown is a little too quick to rob you of sportsmanship points (is throwing a 10-yard pass on third down with more than three minutes left that bad?), it's a fun addition that almost serves as more of a true test of skill than the typical achievements or trophies that are easily earned in simulated games.     A mode that might seem familiar to those who played last year's game is Road to Glory. Essentially, this is the Campus Legend mode from the previous game but with a new coat of paint, otherwise known as ESPN's popular field reporter, Erin Andrews. As you progress from your senior year in high school to your college career, in which you play a single position, Erin occasionally pops in with ESPN analyst Kirk Herbstreit to deliver some news about your career and some highlights. Unfortunately, the biggest problem with Road to Glory isn't that it's mostly just a retread of modes from years past, but rather, it's the fact that the new presentation elements just aren't that interesting--unless, of course, you have a shrine to Erin Andrews somewhere. On top of that, and much like last year, playing anything other than the QB position means you have to deal with some weird passing choices, not to mention terrible play calling that's out of your control. Still, working out in practice and earning points to climb the ranks into a starting position (provided you weren't already offered it) conveys a solid sense of progression. And, like Season Showdown, the leaderboards--along with the option to import your player into other modes--help give that extra little push when it feels like there's no real point to becoming a college football superstar on your own.        One other thing you might notice about the Road to Glory mode, especially if you've selected a position on defense or the receiver spot, is that the camera is locked behind the player instead of the default near-overhead perspective. While this was similarly featured in NCAA 09's Campus Legend mode, this lock-on feature is now available in every other mode in NCAA 10, but is completely optional (if you can navigate to that option before the ball snap). It's actually pretty useful for getting closer to the action, which, in turn, makes it a little easier to spot gaps and running lanes for one your backs. If you're on defense, it's easier to spot these same things as a linebacker. However, it takes some time to get used to this new feature. Because the camera usually tries to stay behind your player, you have to be aware of the direction you're pressing in relation to the camera; you might be running toward the right, but a quick camera rotation will make you briefly run upward. Given that, it's not worth risking a big play.     Some may overlook the Road to Glory mode and head right to the meat and potatoes of the NCAA Football 10 experience: the Dynasty mode. Much like last year, NCAA Football 10 offers offline and online dynasty options (with the ability to convert a dynasty from offline to online and vice versa) with the online option allowing for up to 12 players, as well as customizable teams that can be created through the wonderfully deep and easy-to-use, Web-based Teambuilder site. As the commissioner of an online dynasty, you can rework conferences and schedules, change general settings, and advance the week if you find that other players are lagging behind. The mode is  streamlined and works well, and it's especially interesting to see how other players are progressing through their respective seasons. Unfortunately, manual player recruitment is still rather inelegant because it just drowns you with information--and it's almost not worth the effort of diving into it when it can be done automatically. Of course, if you're going up against other players who are active in the recruitment process, it's fun to compete for specific prospects, yet it still feels like there's no middle ground if you don't want to take the full plunge.       It's also worth mentioning that in the Dynasty mode, along with others, NCAA Football 10 does a lot of odd nickel-and-diming for features that essentially function as cheats. Want to boost your player attributes in the Road to Glory mode? Just go buy them on Xbox Live or the PlayStation Store. Think your school needs more prestige? Throw down some more cash. All of this stuff is completely optional, but it is still inherently annoying knowing that some players are going to bite on this stuff and cheat instead of working toward those same goals the old-fashioned way of playing the game, especially when the latter offers such a great football experience.         But even with these assists, defense still has one glaring issue with its AI. At certain points, defensive players seem to just stand around a bit too much and not pursue the quarterback when the situation obviously calls for it. For example, on a containment play, the defensive ends will dash out to the sides to prevent the running back or QB from sprinting out toward the sideline for an easy run. But why would they continue to sit in the containment position unblocked when the offense is obviously passing the ball and the QB has been standing in the pocket for almost 10 seconds? It doesn't make much sense, and when it happens during a close game, it's unequivocally annoying.       Both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions share the same issues with gameplay, but interestingly, the PS3 version seems to handle some of the visuals a bit better. More specifically, the cutscenes (that show the cheerleaders bounding around after a touchdown) take a hit on the Xbox 360 version, while the PS3 version seems to maintain the same brisk frame rate throughout most of the game. Additionally, both versions have some visual problems with replays near halftime during a late afternoon game--the lighting tends to jump around a bit and give everything a choppy look. Otherwise, the player models look good, as do the stadiums, but it's not a massive leap from last year's game.        "
1973,JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle,6.0,1,"The world of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is absolutely insane. It's a twisted mash-up of Western glam rock style and Eastern anime influences, all wrapped around the ongoing, globe-trotting tales of the Joestar bloodline. Its characters dress in eccentric outfits, strike eccentric poses, and fight using eccentric attacks and techniques. In short, it's the perfect candidate for a fighting game. Drawing from over 25 years of JoJo's story arcs, developer CyberConnect2 (Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3) has put together a fighting game that faithfully re-creates the spirit of the JoJo's universe. At times, however, the developer's devotion to authenticity causes the game to stumble. Just like its source material, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle features a cast of characters with a strange sense of what's vogue. While this does create some entertaining combatants, it is also a double-edged sword. Because the game spends so much time showing off the eccentricities of its fighters, the fights themselves are rather sluggish. Simple acts, such as moving around the arena or performing heavy attacks, take a bit too long to perform, and these minor annoyances quickly add up. Some fighting games can use the slower pace to build tension, but All Star Battle more often leaves you anxious to hurry up and get to your next attack. Persona 4 Arena-style auto combo, ending in a powerful super move if you have the energy to spend. And then there's the dodge button, which lets you sidestep around attacks if timed correctly. While this does create some entertaining combatants, it is also a double-edged sword. Because the game spends so much time showing off the eccentricities of its fighters, the fights themselves are rather sluggish. Most important, however, is the style button. Style does different things depending on the fighting style of your character. Stand fighters summon colorful allies to fight alongside them in battle, while hamon fighters can perform powered-up versions of their special moves, similar to the Street Fighter series' EX attacks. Vampirism, mode, and mounted fighters behave in different ways still with the style button, and together these styles offer a good variety between the cast members within the game's simple fighting framework. But the cadence of the fights themselves still feels off, and it's an issue that impacts the entire roster. For those of you not already familiar with JoJo's lore, All Star Battle's Story mode brings you up to speed, albeit in the most basic way possible. Here, the visual splendor of the JoJo's manga is condensed into a few simple text snippets that you can scroll through during loading screens between fights. But while the story aspect may be lacking, the fights themselves have an interesting twist. Individual fights in Story mode come with some special conditions layered on top--such as the enemy's health automatically refilling or your attack strength being cut. You can give yourself an edge by spending in-game currency to purchase power-ups that can negate these penalties or boost your own stats. This simple metagame between battle conditions and power-ups adds some variety to the standard versus match, and I would have loved to see these items and battle conditions expanded even further. This simple metagame between battle conditions and power-ups [in Story mode] adds some variety to the standard versus match, and I would have loved to see these items and battle conditions expanded even further. While Story mode is pretty straightforward, All Star Battle's Campaign mode is not. In this mode, you start with 10 blocks of energy, which are spent to search for opponents to fight. By defeating these opponents, you unlock new customization items--such as taunts and victory poses--for the roster. Theoretically, when you run out of energy, you can't fight anymore; however, the game trips over itself to make sure you always have more blocks to spend. You can also spend real-world money to purchase more energy blocks or the sorts of power-ups found in Story mode, but in my time with the game, I didn't have the need to do so. As it exists now, the whole energy system feels unnecessary, making this an odd variation on the otherwise sufficient Story mode. With its wide assortment of fighting styles and character gimmicks, All Star Battle desperately needs a mode that teaches you the nuances of its cast--a mode that is sadly absent. Instead, you get a few tooltips in each character's move list, but these are insufficient teaching tools for learning the full complexities of certain characters. Case in point: Jotaro Kujo has a special attack called star finger. This is an unblockable attack with a very long startup animation performed by Kujo's stand. The skill description for star finger says it's ""a corresponding skill for stand rush."" Stand rush is something that is not explained in Kujo's move list, the controller layout, or seemingly anywhere else in the game. As it turns out, stand rush lets Kujo attack while his stand winds up for star finger. This is a pretty significant improvement for an otherwise unsafe attack, but you are simply left to your own devices (read: YouTube) to figure it out. One way or another, when you feel you've mastered your chosen fighter, then it's time to head online. The online offerings for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle are minimal. Player matches have room for only you and one other person, and there is no spectating or replay support. Not being able to watch others play within the game is especially bitter since watching others is a great way to learn more about how to play your favorite characters, and as previously noted, the game lacks a dedicated education mode. In terms of online performance, the game plays well in online matches with optimal connections. Anything below that results in significant and noticeable lag, which hamstrings the fight. For those of you out there who are JoJo's fans first and fighters second, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle is, despite its flaws, still very fun to play. The game is a fantastic vehicle for re-creating the iconic scenes and match-ups from its source material, is easy to pick up and mash out combos, and is every bit as stylish and emotive as the original manga. But once the glitz and glamour fade and you dive a little deeper into this game, the cracks begin to show. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle is packed with style, but simply lacks the substance to back it up."
2301,Half-Life 2,8.0,2,"     So why all the hubbub over an average-length single-player first-person shooter? Keep in mind that Half-Life 2 is the sequel to arguably one of the greatest action games ever made. The original Half-Life single-handedly reinvented the first-person shooter, putting the emphasis on cinematic pacing and complete immersion in the experience. Pretty much every modern-day shooter owes a lot to the original Half-Life. In many ways, this big-budget sequel does what it sets out to do: Half-Life 2 is a technically amazing, sharply honed first-person shooter that pulls all the tricks that made Half-Life such a beloved experience.     In Half-Life 2, you once again assume the role of Gordon Freeman, the theoretical physicist and dimension-hopping commando who saved the world from an alien invasion at the end of Half-Life. Or did he? Half-Life 2 starts you off facing the infamous G-Man, the mysterious blue-suited character from the original. At the end of Half-Life, the G-Man offered you a choice: work for him or die. Since there would be no sequel if you chose the latter, Half-Life 2 assumes you chose the former, and so you start the game on a train entering City 17 for your introduction into this new world.      As soon as the shooting begins you'll join an essentially nonstop battle that will last the remainder of the game. Like the original Half-Life, Half-Life 2 is presented as a nearly seamless experience. You play entirely from Gordon Freeman's perspective, without cutscenes, perspective changes to take you out of the moment, or narrative jumps that skip ahead in time (at least, there are none from your perspective). Surprisingly, the Xbox version is broken up into the same pieces as the PC game, which means that Valve was able to squeeze in the same-sized levels on the Xbox as there are in the PC version. If you played the PC game, then you know that levels are broken up into sections, and it takes about 10 seconds to load in the next section before you can transition from one part of a level to another. When you're killed, you simply load back at the last checkpoint or level save, or the last manual save, as the Xbox lets you keep up to 30 saved games on the hard drive. This sounds like a lot, but you'll probably want to save quite a bit in order to cut down on having to play sections over and over again. And yes, while the load times in the Xbox version are a bit longer than on the PC, they're not frustratingly long, at least. Even with the slightly longer loading times, you're still looking at between 10 to 15 hours of gameplay, depending on your skill level.       The original Half-Life was highly cinematic in nature--the virtual equivalent of starring in your own blockbuster sci-fi action movie. Who could ever forget the first time a headcrab leapt out at you from a dark corner? Or the moment when the commando tossed a satchel charge into the sewer pipe you were hiding in? The movie analogy is apt, not only because Half-Life 2 packs a few cinematic moments of its own, but also because, like most movie sequels, it plays it safe and doesn't deviate much from its storied predecessor. Half-Life 2 doesn't revolutionize the genre. Instead, it sticks with the familiar formula of run-and-gun action, occasional puzzle-solving, and scripted sequences established by Half-Life. And it's an effective formula, for the most part. The action begins with a rousing start, as the opening levels combine these three ingredients masterfully. You start off on the lam from the Combine, armed with only a pistol and your wits, and you embark on a chase through a train yard and tunnel system that's filled with all sorts of hairbreadth escapes.         After you reach safety, Half-Life 2 settles into a more conventional and familiar style of play. Aside from a detour through a deserted town full of all sorts of booby traps, there are a lot of echoes of the original Half-Life in Half-Life 2--so many, in fact, that there's a strong sense of déjà vu at times. Still, it's hard to knock Valve for not wanting to tinker too much with a proven formula, and Half-Life 2 is as fast-paced and enjoyable as its predecessor. Clad in your rugged hazard suit, you'll battle your way forward against all manner of enemies, only to recover quickly by picking up health packs and recharging your hazard suit at energy stations. Some of these foes are familiar, such as the headcrab and the barnacle, while others, like the manhacks (essentially flying buzz saws) present whole new challenges. Meanwhile, you'll be armed with a formidable arsenal, most of which is recycled from the first game, such as the submachine gun, shotgun, crossbow, and, of course, the ubiquitous crowbar. These weapons haven't changed much, and they feel roughly the same. There are only three new weapons, including the pulse rifle, which is a sort of beefed-up energy rifle with a devastating secondary attack and a meaty sound to it.                The controls translate really well to the Xbox's gamepad, and we like the solution that Valve came up with for manipulating your formidable arsenal later on. You'd think that selecting from two different pistols, a shotgun, assault rifle, rocket launcher, grenades, crowbar, gravity gun, crossbow, and more would be a bit awkward, but Valve has an elegant solution. Meanwhile, the rest of the controls conform to the standard first-person-shooter controls established by Halo. And, yes, there have been some concessions to the aim mechanic to make it work better with the gamepad, which is far less accurate than a mouse. There's essentially auto-aim in the Xbox version, so often all you have to do is move the targeting cursor somewhere near the target and it will lock on (the hit detection is also very generous on your end).      you are Gordon Freeman, then giving him a voice would take away from the immersion. Valve got away with this in the original Half-Life because Gordon encountered few characters, and they didn't linger onscreen for too long. On the other hand, Half-Life 2 features whole conversations where everyone is talking to you, and it's just weird that they seem fine with you not saying anything in return. The conversations that do take place remain some of the better parts of the game, as Half-Life 2 has excellent facial technology that brings human characters to life in a believable way. It also helps that Valve enlisted notable talent to supply the voices for many characters, including Robert Guillaume, Louis Gossett Jr., Robert Culp, and Michelle Forbes. The voice acting is superb, and the script itself features wit, warmth, and humor.   The sound effects are also well done. Once again, it's the little details that stand out, like the buzzing noise of manhacks as they approach and the clatter of a gutter pipe as something climbs up to reach you. As in the original, there's very little music, and what's here is electronic in nature and reserved to emphasize important moments, such as when you're headed for a showdown with a major foe. Despite a few standout themes (one of which is recycled from the original), most of the music is forgettable.        Unfortunately, once you get through the single-player story, you've pretty much seen everything that Half-Life 2 for the Xbox has to offer. In a move that will undoubtedly upset fans, the Xbox version lacks any kind of multiplayer capability, from split screen to Xbox Live support. Valve argues that Counter-Strike is already available as a separate Xbox game. But, if you were looking forward to Counter-Strike: Source on the Xbox or Half-Life 2 deathmatch with the gravity gun, then you'll likely be disappointed. This has an obvious impact on the game's value, as multiplayer was a huge part of the PC version. Also, the Xbox version lacks the mod-making features of the PC, which has a huge number of user-created mods.     When you get down to it, Half-Life 2 for the Xbox is an excellent single-player game. If you didn't get a chance to play the PC version, then you owe it to yourself to check out the game on the Xbox (even though it's not as smooth and as sharp as what you'll find on the PC). You'll find few games that can match Half-Life 2's quality in terms of immersion and gameplay. And all these months after its original release, it's still an excellent first-person shooter that should be experienced by most every action fan. Just don't expect anything more after the game ends.   "
4076,Toonsylvania,5.0,1,"Toonsylvania is based the cartoon series of the same name. The game is a platformer, of sorts, and stars Igor, the series' requisite hunchback. Igor's quest is to reassemble Toonsylvania's take on Frankenstein's monster, whose parts have been scattered throughout the game world as a result of a botched experiment.  As logic would dictate, the game's action revolves around Igor collecting the monster's scattered body parts through a series of platform levels. The levels aren't as linear as you'd expect; rather, they're fairly sprawling and allow for plenty of free roaming. Replete with ledges and pits, the environments are decorated quite richly, though many cosmetic objects often appear to be gameplay-related - you'll often find yourself trying to flick a switch that is, in actuality, part of the background.  Igor's goal in each stage is to collect a set number of quest objects (unique to each stage) in order to proceed. This involves loads of item fetching throughout the stages, which seem sprawling at first, but tend to feel rather cramped once you've bounced through them a dozen times. The switches that trigger the appearance of quest objects are also largely identical to the decor of the stages, so finding the correct object to flick is mostly a matter of trial and error. Once the correct switch is found and triggered, the game segues to the area where the quest object rests, which is usually indistinguishable from the rest of the stage. What results is a mad scramble through the indistinguishable areas that make up a stage, hoping that you'll stumble upon the all-important quest objects. At the end of each world, as per the formula, awaits a boss, whose defeat grants Igor a piece of the monster.  To get through all the obstacles put in his path, Igor is armed with a vicious punch attack, and he often picks up skulls that he can lob at enemies. Both attacks are mapped so the same button, and there's no way to deselect the skulls, so, when armed, Igor will alternately punch and lob skulls, depending on his proximity to enemies. The enemies you best will respawn once you leave the screen, though, so avoiding them altogether is the best bet, unless they're overtly blocking your path.  From a visual standpoint, Toonsylvania looks quite good; Igor himself boasts quite a bit of animation, and his gestures are genuinely amusing. If anything, LSP has done much to imbue him with the life of his televised counterpart. The stages, while less-than-ideal to traverse, actually look pretty nice, if a bit overproduced - almost every nook and cranny boasts some kind of embellishment. The cinematics are well produced and quite impressive, considering the platform. Likeness to the subject of its license is something Toonsylvania was able to pull off successfully.  With so many exceptional Game Boy platformers on the market, one simply can't justify picking up Toonsylvania. Unless you're a rabid fan of the cartoon series, the tedium involved easily overshadows anything the game might have going for it."
4945,Reel Fishing,1.0,0,"Whether you love real fishing or not, you'll probably hate Reel Fishing. No matter how patient you are, the sheer shallowness of this game will probably lull you into a catatonic state. Primarily FMV-driven, with otherwise stupid, deficient graphics, and perhaps the most repetitive gameplay to ever retard the potential of the PlayStation, Reel Fishing is really a dog. For the most part, play involves two different screens, the first of which treats potential fishmasters to video of a real-life fishing hole, complete with unmoving camera, incessant nature sounds, and plodding new age music! Superimposed over this are little, solid, black squiggles (the lurking fish) and a very low-res vertical yellow line (the pole). This is honestly one of the silliest-looking interfaces on the PlayStation. There's just something inherently cheap and embarrassing about mixing graphical media. Once you cast your line and wait for a bite, you switch to screen two, which is underwater, and features more video (of the river bottom scrolling by), another low-res-looking fishing line, and much-improved fish graphics. This time the fish looks quite real, but it's only capable of maybe six different moves and switches from one animation to another (for example, swimming peacefully with the hook in its mouth, thrashing around and trying to break free) with amateurish jerkiness.  Reel Fishing is certainly lacking in the gameplay department. In fact, there are few moments when you're afforded the opportunity to intervene in the game at all. Now, some would say that's in keeping with the spirit of the real thing. Offering a game that demands that you leave the controls alone and let nature take its course is more... uh... natural. In practice, this is a terrible mistake. After casting your line in screen one, you spend a fair amount of time waiting for something to bite. This is excusable. Once you enter screen two, however, control proves entirely lacking. It's the same every time - it doesn't matter how many times you play it, what sort of fish is biting, or where you are: The fish approaches from the right, takes the bait, and starts swimming to the left (in profile). At the precise moment of its bite, you must push X to set the hook in its mouth, after which you must release all buttons or lose the fish. A tedious game of cat and mouse ensues. Your sole role in landing the thing is to push X when it slows down, which causes it to turn and swim to the right, and release X in favor of the D-pad (which may be pressed up, down, or right, with identical results) to keep the line taut when the fish flips out and starts thrashing around. Then, it will swim left again (release all buttons), until it tires and you can resume pressing the X button. You repeat this simple pattern until the fish is caught. That's it. All of gameplay. For level after level. The fish always swims to the left when it's feeling perky and to the right when it's tired. We spend most of the time looking blankly at the screen, doing next to nothing.  This of course makes it sound easy, but it's not. Sometimes it takes eight or nine tries before the thing finally gives up. Often, if you don't time your initial hook-set depression of the X-button just right, the fish will just strip your hook of its bait and swim off, and you have to start from scratch. The same thing goes for releasing the buttons when the damned thing is thrashing around; if you're late, your line will break. It seems odd to create a game that requires the precise use of none of the buttons. The game's learning curve is rather steep, mostly because it's hard to believe that you're really supposed to do nothing for so much of the time. As the game goes on (and on) you are required to qualify for each new stage by catching a certain number or length of fish at each subsequent location. Twenty trout at the first stream is one thing, but 100 fish to pass from level seven to eight? That sounds a bit more like torture. OK, admittedly, all this nothingness lands Reel Fishing squarely in the sim department. Actual fishing involves plenty of relaxing downtime, and so it follows that a fishing sim would be very laid back and minimal. The point is that it just doesn't work from a gameplay standpoint. The game doesn't offer the array of options or strategic depth with which the better sims make up for any slowness in play. The bottom line is that Reel Fishing could have been (at best) the fishing segment of a more interesting game. Maybe a five-minute diversion from the exciting plotline of some RPG. Like the motorcycle or Chocobo racing sections of Final Fantasy VII, there's just no way this thing can stand on its own. Sure, it may sell a few copies to uncles and fathers of video game-addicted kids. I can hear Mom now, ""Now you can play Station too, honey."" But aside from momentary interest as a novelty item, this one will instantly be buried deep in the subconscious undersea world of forgotten games."
3374,MySims SkyHeroes,4.0,0,"  There's a scene in the Story mode in MySims SkyHeroes where the elder pilot of SkyForce (the group of pilots fighting the evil MorcuCorp) asks everyone if they know what he's about to ask them to do. Suddenly, the other pilots of SkyForce have a look of abject apathy on their faces as they realize he's about to send them on another wargames mission. That same look will suddenly be transposed to your face as you realize that this is the very same dogfighting mission you've already played several times before, and it won't be the last. Therein lies the biggest problem with the single-player experience in SkyHeroes--filling out an entire Story mode with just two game types that hardly ever change over the course of dozens of missions.       The first of these game types you experience in the Story mode is dogfighting, which initially doesn't seem all that bad. You start out by customizing your pilot, as well as your plane, which is pretty fun because there are plenty of parts to choose from. As you progress through the Story mode, you can unlock additional customization options for your sim, as well as necessary upgrades to your plane. If you get far enough, characters from other EA games, like Commander Shepard from Mass Effect or Isaac Clark from Dead Space become available. Sadly, these don't really act as much incentive to play through the Story mode because they're available from the start in the quickplay option. Additionally, their inclusion is just cosmetic as you have access to the same aerial maneuvers (barrel rolls, flips, and the like performed with the right analog stick), as well as weaponry in the form of machine guns and power-ups scattered throughout a map.           There are some slight variations to the mission structure where you have to take down some stationary targets, but for the most part, it's just dogfighting and racing in the Story mode with all of their shortcomings in tow. Thankfully, there are online and local splitscreen multiplayer options in SkyHeroes where you can jump into one of these two types of matches (as teammates or in a free-for-all) without the sometimes humorous but often unnecessary story elements bogging everything down. Certainly, there's some fun to be had in multiplayer, particularly for newcomers who might get a thrill out of taking down their buddies without having to worry about horrible AI. But it's short lived. Experienced pilots will often find themselves circling each other until one decides to break off out of boredom and while the weapon power-ups sometimes shift the balance of a match, they're not all that difficult to avoid.         MySims SkyHeroes isn't quite full retail price (it comes in at $49.99) on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, but it really seems like the game tries its best to make it worth the normal cost. The problem is SkyHeroes stretches two relatively shallow, albeit accessible, game types over an excessively long Story mode where their AI problems are put on display over and over again. The multiplayer can be a source of some entertainment, but only lasts as long as the learning curve does--which is to say, not that long. Once players become experienced, it often just becomes a race to see who can gain the strongest power-ups while they're not flying in circles. This might have worked well as a smaller, more limited, and cheaper downloadable product, but as a full retail offering, SkyHeroes never gets off the ground.    "
3949,Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb,5.0,1," When Tomb Raider first hit the scene back in 1996, it was easy to describe the game's premise as an Indiana Jones movie with a female lead. Lara Croft spent the next several years cornering the market on the video game version of action archeology, and even though the comparisons to Harrison Ford's big-screen character never really stopped completely, it took LucasArts four years to strike back with Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, a flawed game for the PC and the Nintendo 64. Now, LucasArts is giving its whip-cracking action hero another shot at the title with Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, which was developed by The Collective. While the game does a lot of things right, severe graphical issues surface at almost every turn and essentially nullify its strong points, leaving behind a game with lots of untapped potential.       Emperor's Tomb takes place in 1935 and puts the rough-and-ready archeologist on a quest to recover a Chinese artifact known as the Heart of the Dragon--a black pearl with the power to control minds. In keeping with the standard Indiana Jones formula, our good doctor isn't the only party involved in the quest, and along the way you'll encounter plenty of Nazi thugs and Chinese gang members, all of whom want the pearl for their own evil uses. Though the plot contains a few twists and double crosses, the game is very thin on storytelling, only breaking into a cutscene to move you from one part of the world to another. Even the mission objectives aren't expressly conveyed outside of the pause screen, though the linear nature of the level design doesn't often force you to know exactly what you're after at any given time, anyway. While the game is pretty straightforward, it does throw a lot of different levels at you, moving through a number of different locales along the way--you'll travel to Prague, Istanbul, Hong Kong, an island fortress, and more. Even though you'll be moving along from place to place fairly quickly, it doesn't feel like a short game, and players should be able to get a little more than 10 hours out of it. There isn't much replay value to speak of, of course, though the game does contain three difficulty settings and a handful of optional artifacts that are hidden throughout the levels.      The game combines the exploration and third-person maneuvering of Tomb Raider with a simplified version of the combat system found in The Collective's last game, the well-received Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Indy runs on a modified and ported version of the Buffy engine, and you can perform most of the running- and jumping-related maneuvers you'd expect to in a third-person action game. At first, the control feels a little too loose--it's easy to miss jumps if you're sloppy with the controls--but after some time, moving Dr. Jones around becomes second nature. You'll often find yourself having to use Indy's bullwhip to swing from one platform to another. The game always lets you know where, exactly, you'll need to do this by bringing a whip icon up on the screen when you're in position. Similarly, you'll see a knife icon when it's time to hack through thick vines, a switch icon when there's something for you to pull, and an explosion icon when you're near a spot that requires you to plant explosives. When any of these icons are up, an inventory button lets you quickly yank out the necessary item. While this helps make the game a lot easier than it would have been without them, at other times the occasionally unclear level design and nasty, blurry textures obscure some things that you'd otherwise need to see for yourself in order to proceed.   While you'll spend most of your time in the game running around and climbing up and over platforms, there is also quite a bit of combat to be found. While the combat isn't terribly deep, it still can be satisfying. Indy's punches and kicks are exaggerated, giving you the impression that he's really beating the hell out of his foes. He has a good variety of dirty moves in his arsenal, and a combo system lets you string attacks together.     Your whip comes into play during combat as well. Normally, you just whip people, but if you get the distance between you and your target down right, you can whip weapons out of enemies' hands or even wrap the whip around a foe's neck and drag him over to you, Scorpion-style, for a quick left to the face. You can also find and use a variety of firearms and makeshift weapons like chairs, and the game even has a grappling system that lets you get in a few cheap punches or shove people up against walls--or over the edges of cliffs, where you'll hear them go screaming down to their doom.       With its satisfying combat system and straightforward exploration elements, Indiana Jones definitely has the mechanics to be a cool game. It's this potential that makes the game's crippling graphical problems so disappointing. The lack of polish in the game makes it seem unfinished and ranges from plainly obvious clipping and collision problems to a wildly fluctuating frame rate that bounces from only slightly choppy to what feels like a near halt. On top of all that, the entire game is extremely blurry. At times the game is so blurry that you might start to wonder if your PS2's video cables are going bad or if perhaps someone snuck into your house and smeared butter all over your TV screen.      The game's sound does a good job of emulating the music from the Indiana Jones movies. The soundalike used for Indiana Jones himself does a convincing enough job of sounding like Harrison Ford's take on the character, but you probably won't ever mistake the stand-in for the real deal. Some of the other voices don't fare so well. The standard enemy voices get repetitive, and some of the accents--Mei Ying's Chinese accent, for example--sound pretty bad.   The good parts of Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb offer a glimpse of what could have been, but the PS2 version of this game pales in comparison with even the buggy Xbox release. You can definitely see a great game hidden in the finished product, but calling the Emperor's Tomb ""finished"" doesn't seem right. There's definitely some fun to be had here, and Indiana Jones fans will likely appreciate the way their favorite archeologist is represented in the game, but the shoddy translation of this Xbox game to the PlayStation 2 makes the end result seem pretty unplayable.  "
1520,Super Mario Maker,9.0,2,"Super Mario Maker. In other games with a built-in ""creator"" mode, like LittleBigPlanet, I would just ignore the creation aspect and focus on playing. Mod and level design tools for most RPGs require too much dedicated study and practice to draw me in. But with Mario Maker, it's incredibly simple to design a hideous torture chamber. Or indeed any product of intentionally horrible, unfair game design. I'm still not very good at it, but I'm beginning to love creating. Super Mario Maker is essentially two games: A design tool and a traditional 2D platformer. The tool aspect lets you crib elements from several Mario games and toss them together into a level of your own making, which you can then upload online for everyone else to play. You choose the overall graphical skin from among Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, or New Super Mario Bros. U. This affects the way everything looks and sounds, and how some items are used (for example, Mario World allows access to Cape Mario while New Super Mario Bros. U swaps that with Propellor Mario). And the background that you choose (airship, underwater, castle, etc.), determines the stage and musical themes. The mix-and-match nature allows for exciting and anachronistic additions to familiar scenarios, like dropping a version of Bowser Jr. into an 8-bit style underwater Mario level. And some items can be combined for interesting new effects--placing a POW block in a pipe creates a pipe the distributes POW blocks, and putting a mushroom on pretty much any item, or enemy, makes it significantly larger. It's a simple system that involves dragging and dropping different items from the menu bar into the environment. Copying, deleting, and drawing platforms is as easy as swiping and drawing across the Wii U tablet. As you place your level's obstacles and platforms, little background elements pop up adding color and variety to the scenery. And with an undo ""dog"" button and a restart ""rocket"" icon, the menu aesthetic is an obvious nod to the quirky, experimental SNES title Mario Paint. You'll even get flies swarming around your screen if you let the game idle for too long. Building off of Mario Paint's eclectic sense of humor, you can also add pre-recorded sound and visual effects to your stage that would have never been used in a more traditional Mario game. Whether that's as simple as a friendly ""ding"" when you hit the correct box, or a ""beating heart"" sound when you want to add some tension to an ominous dungeon hallway, the effects use the same intuitive drag-and-drop system as the game's other items. Everything is incredibly easy to understand, implement, and experiment with, which makes creating levels, even for a complete novice, fun and effortless. Unlike other games where the creation aspect is secondary to playing through a story or mission mode, crafting a level in Mario Maker is the focus. And also unlike with those games, creating a level is just as fun as playing one. Swapping between building and testing a stage is immediate and seamless, so it's easy to try new ideas. This lends the game a sense of discovery and adventure, even after you've been creating for hours. While it rarely feels like there aren't enough tools create with, the longer you spend with Mario Maker, the more you might notice things you can't do. There's no way to add a mid-stage checkpoint. The dimensional limits of the levels are set in stone, so if you want to build something focused on a long, vertical freefall, rather than a horizontal jaunt, you're out of luck. Enemy AI is fixed--you can't create Goombas or Turtles that will try to actively seek out and attack Mario (though there are Mario-seeking Bullet Bills already included). And while you're allowed to place and use the game's creations in almost any way you like, the broader details, whether that's changing the color palette of an enemy or composing your own music, are outside your control. The restrictions doubtless keep the creation aspect more focused on interesting gameplay moments, but--especially with Mario Maker's other nods to Mario Paint--it's hard not to want just a little bit more freedom to expand past the bounds of a normal Mario game. And, as both a positive and a negative, you don't have complete access to all of the game's creation tools when you first turn it on. You start off with a very limited palette of items and themes to experiment with, and more of the game's options unlock the longer you spend creating. That unlock time isn't measured in hours, however; it's measured in days. After playing with the tools you have available for about five minutes, you'll get an on-screen message saying the next unlock is queued up for delivery...the next day. Come back the next day, play for five more minutes with your new toys, and the next set of items will queue up for another next-day delivery. It's a simple albeit tedious system to bypass: backing out of the game and changing your system's clock lets you hack your way to quicker access. But even though that week-long process of unlocking all the game's available items is a bit too long, it does serve a purpose: it makes sure you get out of the creator and play more levels. Experimenting with the creation tools and playing around with the maker aspect is fun on its own, but the way you really learn to use those tools is through trying other peoples' creations. Just like reading makes you a better writer and listening to music makes you a better musician, playing through stages, both good and bad, lets you experience first-hand what works and doesn't work in a level. Mario Maker comes with a suite of pre-built stages, so there's something to try out even if you never go online and try user-created content. But the user-created levels are where the real sparks of both genius and maddening difficulty come in. With a mix of hundreds of stages from around the world, I survived gauntlets of impossible-looking spinning fire traps; crossed massive gaps that required precise, last-second jumps; and solved levels that were more about using shells and other items in creative ways rather than reflexes and timing. In one particularly devious stage, I was forced to avoid mushrooms entirely, normally a highly sought-after power-up, in order to squeeze through tiny gaps at certain points in the level. The catch: the level was filled with hundreds of mushrooms. The game makes it easy to find and sort user-created levels by popularity, difficulty, and creator. And the force that keeps driving you through these player-created levels, no matter how crazy, is knowing that someone had to beat them to upload them. They might seem hard. They might be put together with unbelievable unfairness. And maybe its creator only got through using luck and sheer force of will. But someone beat that level at least once, and that means you can too. Super Mario Maker is a game of joyous creation and fun surprises. And that's without mentioning things like the music, a highlight in every Mario game. From the familiar and joyous themes of the main worlds to the altered riffs you get when tinkering around in Make mode, the soundtrack captures that same essence of wonder and surprise as the rest of the game. Even the in-game instruction manual is incredibly useful and entertaining; it's graphically animated, written with a great sense of humor, and, for no particular reason, throws in some thoughts about brussel sprouts. The first time I discovered that not only could I make a giant, flame-spewing piranha plant, but I could also make it fly, I cackled with horrible glee at the possibilities. And for the first time in a creation-focused experience, I look forward to returning again and again for more than just the amazing levels I know other people will create. I want to keep making my own levels better. The game won't necessarily turn you into the next Shigeru Miyamoto, but you can almost feel a little bit of that magic rubbing off every time you upload a new creation.  "
3309,Monopoly Streets,6.0,1,"      Monopoly Streets takes this winning concept and places the familiar board spots on a gigantic block in Monopoly City, which features three-dimensional structures replacing the simple virtual boards of previous outings. None of the models are particularly memorable and all three consoles are harried by rough graphical edges in a few minor spots, but there are small surprises. For example, you encounter Monopoly's familiar austere railroads brought to life as elevated train stations, Free Parking as a multilevel parking garage (bearing an amusing resemblance to New York's Guggenheim Museum), and the dreary and decaying lots that signify mortgaged properties. Elsewhere, however, the concept fails to follow its own lead. Random non-player characters shamble through the streets, but they never acknowledge you or gawk at your property. New buildings lack any kind of staff, such as doormen at Park Place who could have taken your rent and turned up their noses. Thus, the charm is sporadic at best, and key structures, such as the prosaic income tax building, scream with untapped comedic potential.     Nothing visually defines Monopoly so well as Mr. Moneybags and his merry band of pewter game pieces, and happily, nine pieces make an appearance here. Mr. Moneybags serves as the host, offering wordy and mildly humorous commentary on every move that quickly grows tiring. When starting a game, Moneybags also leads players through the selection of their favorite tokens along with an unalterable accompanying character that complements each piece. (As a console-specific bonus, Xbox 360 players can play as their system avatars and fill cities with their friends. The same option is available on the Wii using Miis, but only after you unlock it, which requires very little effort.) The top hat, for instance, belongs to a kid magician who follows it as it tumbles down the sidewalk on each turn. The battleship belongs to an admiral who may as well have just stepped out of a Gilbert and Sullivan production. Sadly, this potentially strong idea is hit or miss at best, thanks to cloying voice emotes and time-consuming animations, and two characters in particular can quickly ruin your enjoyment. For one, there's the farmer, a ditzy female bumpkin in cutoff shorts who pushes the wheelbarrow token around the block to a stream of nonstop yuk-yuks and yee-haws. Elsewhere, the little girl associated with the thimble gratingly screeches and spins with glee during her entire turn. It's enough to make you turn off the voice-overs before your first match is complete. The music is only slightly better and ends up sounding like the soundtrack to a floor-wax commercial jammed on infinite loop.       The turns themselves can drag on for ages if you leave the game to its own devices. A typical turn runs like so: You roll the dice (which takes two clicks) to the sound of your character's whoops or hollers. Once your character has exhausted his or her excitement and stopped dancing around, he or she then mounts or follows the giant pewter token one step at a time to the appropriate spot on the board. They look at the plot being considered in awe. If it's for sale, Mr. Moneybags slowly waddles up and eggs the character on to buy or auction the plot. By now, you've had your turn for more than a minute, to the likely impatience of your fellow players, and you haven't even bought the land yet. And your fellow players' turns can be equally as long--or longer--given the tendency of online players to abuse the build button. This is unforgivably damaging in a game that's infamous for its epic hours-long play sessions. So sure is the game that your attention will wander during all of this that all three consoles' controllers vibrate when it's finally your turn again. Thankfully, you can skip most animations and speed up gameplay considerably by turning off most animations on the options menu at the expense of losing the game's unique flavor.          You can also opt for a change of scenery once you amass enough Monopoly money from completing games in Landmark City, the game's only other virtual metropolis. True to its name, Landmark City features some of the world's most legendary tourist traps (such as London's Big Ben), but it's rather Disneyland-ish and lacks the visual coherence of Monopoly City. Although more cities are scheduled for release as downloadable content, it's a shame that more weren't included in the initial retail package. And if you still can't get used to the alleys and buildings of Monopoly City, you can always play on seven different versions of the trusty classic Monopoly board. These come complete with very basic jungle and winter themes but no building in sight.       Otherwise, the gameplay is decently customizable, and if you're used to certain nonstandard rules (such as using Free Parking to grab all the money from income tax and the like), you can usually re-create them here. You can also play by standard Monopoly rules or take up some of the game's faster options. These include games like Speed Die, in which you play with an extra die and begin with an extra $1,000; and Short Game, in which all four players start with four random properties. Alternatively, you can play Bull Market, which limits play time to 20 rounds; or Fast Deal, which awards the first player who collects the most color groups; or Jackpot, which radically alters the rules and allows you to sell properties containing houses or hotels. Online multiplayer options for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 offer many of the same options as the offline mode while sticking to standard rules and the faster setups. This includes Bull Market and Short Game, in addition to ranked matches and the option to create custom rules. The ranked matches can be fun, but when your losing rival storms out at the sight of you adding yet another pile of deeds to your stash, the game shuts down and you receive no credit despite however many minutes you put in.      "
4652,Labyrinth (2007),4.0,0,"  All the mall goths of the world can just go ahead and settle down: This isn't a new video game based on that goofy David Bowie movie from 1986. It's just a generic and crummy puzzle game that's heavily based on a wicked obscure Taito arcade game called Cameltry. In the game, you navigate a perpetually falling ball through one of several mazelike worlds by rotating the scenery. A few of the puzzles are legitimately interesting, and there's four-player single-card multiplayer. But you can breeze through this game if you're dedicated enough, and frequent collision issues make that sort of dedication nearly impossible.     Gameplay is very straightforward. You can use either the D pad or the DS's shoulder buttons to rotate a given stage in either direction. The idea is to keep your ball moving through the level and get it to the goal at the end before time runs out. Along the way, a variety of obstacles aim to screw you up, including blocks that cost you time when you touch them, blocks that hang you up, arrows that start pushing you in the wrong direction, and the like. You can push past some of these obstacles using a spin button that breaks certain blocks and lets you move through the arrows. But beyond that, the game is all about tilting, tilting, tilting until you figure out the various mazes.        Figuring out the mazes isn't usually the tough part. The level designs are all reasonably straightforward, and while a few provide a bit of brain twisting, it's rare to get hung up for more than a couple of tries on any individual level. The only thing that makes the game legitimately frustrating at all is an issue with the game's collision detection. There are times when your ball will simply get hung up on a block or section of the scenery, and no matter how much you tilt, you just can't seem to get it off there without turning the whole thing upside down...only to get it stuck again the next time you try to pass through that section. Because you're on a timer, these lengthy hang-ups are a real pain. There are also sections where you'll be banging away on the spin button to bust through some blocks, but they just won't break for whatever reason--even when you spin around to try to get some momentum on the hit.     In some capacity, those moments of frustration are almost welcome because they pad out the experience a bit. As long as you don't run into any serious issues, you can beat the single-player in perhaps an hour or two at most. There's some motivation to go back to certain stages to unlock new ball designs, but that's about it. Given the frustrations of the collision detection, that motivation is slight--at best.     At least there's a multiplayer mode, albeit a somewhat uneventful one. Up to four players can play on a single card, and the mode itself is simply a race to get your ball to the finish line first. The game randomly selects levels, and there's no real score tracking in the mode. Someone wins, you start up another race, someone wins that one, and so on and so forth. It's nice that the mode is there, but it's unlikely that anyone will enjoy it for especially long.     Presentation is another point of contention. The graphics are bland as bland can be, with stages that are primarily gray, brown, or a combination of the two. There's almost nothing in the way of visual effects or tricks to try to spice things up as you spin around. Sure, there are some different ball designs and colors, but that hardly makes up for the dull level designs. Audio is merely some overly cheery music combined with clicks and clacks of balls hitting stuff, while the occasional voice sample of some infuriatingly enthusiastic Japanese girl shrieks at you to let you know if you won or failed.      Again, Labyrinth's tilt-based gameplay is sort of interesting, but the collision issues and the fact that you'll basically be done with it after an hour or so suck away whatever appeal existed in the game design. The DS is rich beyond imagination with far better and more interesting puzzle games than this one. Stick with those.  "
1244,World of Final Fantasy,6.0,1,"Things don't exactly get off to a rollicking start. After a cryptic initial cutscene, you’re treated to a too-long set of introductory cinematics that offer little in the way of actual introduction. You meet fraternal twins Lann and Reynn, who apparently have been living a normal life in a city working at a coffee shop--until a mysterious woman and a strange creature give them surprising news. The twins learn that they--and their mother--were once important figures in a world named Grymoire filled with monsters and tiny people known as Lilikin. It’s a pretty head-scratching introduction--and not in a good way. It doesn’t help that Enna vanishes while calling herself “god.” The duo are left with Tama as their guide, who has a speech the-pattern that will very quickly start to drive you the-bonkers.When the twins get to Grymoire, they discover they can change from tiny to normal size to get around and interact with the populace. They also can “imprism” the Mirage monsters that roam Grymoire, turning them into battling companions. Bad things are afoot in Grymoire, however--a group of armor-clad figures called the Bahamutian Army have annexed numerous territories in the realm under the guise of benevolence, though their true goal is to enact a complex prophecy involving plenty of good old fashioned chaos and destruction.Grymoire is a beautiful place filled with otherworldly environments that, combined with the cute monsters that lurk within, capture a whimsical, storybook feel. When they’re not traversing the wilderness, Lann and Reynn wind up in towns based on locations from previous Final Fantasy games, such as Nibelheim from Final Fantasy VII. It’s here that the duo will usually encounter familiar (but cuter) Final Fantasy characters who harbor the souls of “champions” and use their abilities to help Lann and Reynn defeat the Bahamutian Army’s evil machinations.Despite its chibi-sized Final Fantasy heroes and focus on monster collecting, you won't be summoning an army of adorable Final Fantasy characters to do battle for you. Most of your battling companions are of the monstrous variety--you can only summon famous Final Fantasy characters to battle after dealing and accruing enough damage, and only after meeting them in the story and acquiring their Champion Medal. They don’t show up for long--they just unleash a special attack and then peace out, acting much like summoned monsters would in a traditional Final Fantasy game.Despite its chibi-sized Final Fantasy heroes and focus on monster collecting, you won't be summoning an army of adorable Final Fantasy characters to do battle for you.That isn’t to say that combat is a completely by-the-numbers affair. Lann and Reynn can have up to four monsters accompany them in fights. Every monster is assigned a size--small, medium, or large--and you can “stack” the twins and monsters into a cute critter column to fight with. Stacks offer a lot of benefits: characters in a stack pool their health, ability points, attack and defense power, skills, and elemental resistances together to create a powerful entity that can withstand heavy hits and deal more damage than the characters would individually--at the cost of the turns each individual character would get in battle.Characters in a stack can also combine certain skills and turn them into more powerful techniques. For example, if two stacked characters have water magic, you’ll get access to a higher-level water spell. Enemies can also stack up for similar benefits, so sometimes you’ll want to use attacks that can topple a stack of characters. When a stack collapses, everyone in the tower winds up stunned for a turn, giving you free rein to smack them around. Naturally, your towers are just as vulnerable to collapsing, so you need to be careful when you see signs of wobbling.Of course, before you can stack up critters like a pile of pancakes, you’ll need to capture them. While many monsters become catchable after a few simple attacks, others require very specific actions before you can imprism them: You may have to hit them with a particular status ailment, give them an item, or use a particular style of attack. While this helps make the game’s monster-catching element a bit more dynamic, it can be extremely annoying in practice. You may run into some one-time-encounter monster in the field, only to discover that you don't have the skills in your current party necessary to capture them. You can't run from these fights, nor can you swap out monsters in battle, leaving you no choice but to beat the rare monster normally and cry over the missed opportunity.That’s only one of a pile of little annoyances that drag down the World of Final Fantasy experience. The battles, even at max speed, move at a glacial pace, making it almost necessary to hold R1 to fast forward through them at all times (and tiring your index finger in the process). Every monster has a “Mirage Board” similar to the Sphere Grid and Crystarium from Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy XIII, respectively; these unlock various skills and abilities by using points earned from leveling up. These kinds of skill-up grids work nicely in role-playing games with limited character sets, but they become a royal pain to manage when you’re juggling numerous creatures in and out of your party. Most monsters in the game have alternate forms that you can access when they reach a certain level, but these variations don’t retain many of the skills of their previous incarnations, and the new forms have their own Mirage Boards to futz around with.The overarching story, exploration, and monster collecting didn’t interest me nearly as much as seeing which Final Fantasy character I might encounter next.Dungeons tend to be very linear (and they’re less fun to explore than they are to look at), and you’ll sometimes come to a puzzle or obstacle that requires a specific monster skill or set of properties in order to progress. If you don’t have the right monsters in your current party you must either use an expensive item or go back to a teleport/save point to swap in the correct monsters or capture some new beasts with the properties you need (and perhaps grind them up to unlock the necessary skill to progress).At least there’s some reward for suffering through these aggravations: The dialogue and character writing are both incredibly charming, filled with lots of peppy exchanges between the twins and the assorted NPCs they encounter (the aforementioned Tama excepted). A little bit into the game, you get the ability to participate in various character vignettes starring the Final Fantasy characters.These segments are ridiculously adorable and tons of fun to watch. The further I advanced in World of Final Fantasy, the more it felt like I was just playing to see the little interactions among the twins and the other characters--the overarching story, exploration, and monster collecting didn’t interest me nearly as much as seeing which Final Fantasy character I might encounter next. The game is ultimately worse when it stops being cute and goofy and tries to tell a serious story.Unfortunately, you have to put up with a fair amount of frustration and filler before you get to enjoy the best of what World of Final Fantasy has to offer, namely charming writing and Final Fantasy fan service. If you’re willing to put up with some of the game’s mundane sequences, you’ll get some enjoyment out of it, but if you’re not a Final Fantasy fanatic, the magic in these moments may be lost altogether."
4689,Final Fight: Streetwise,3.0,0,"  The beat-'em-up is dead. Really, it's been dead ever since gaming went polygonal. Early 3D attempts like Fighting Force set the tone for games like Beat Down: Fists of Vengeance and Spikeout: Battle Street, making bad cameras and generic, boring action the new hallmarks of a genre that used to have no fewer than three stand-out games in it: Taito's Double Dragon, Sega's Streets of Rage, and Capcom's Final Fight. Fresh for 2006, Capcom has a new take on its series, the curse-filled fist-fest Final Fight: Streetwise. But all this game manages to do is further nail the genre's coffin closed, while sullying the good name of an arcade classic along the way.        Streetwise puts you in the role of Kyle Travers, younger brother of Final Fight's Cody. If you've been following Cody's story over the years, you remember that he appeared in Street Fighter Alpha 3 as a convict. Streetwise picks up on this and paints him as a released convict, which you'll notice only because he still wears his orange jail shirt. Anyway, Cody's old now, apparently, because he can't fight anymore. But Kyle can, and the game opens with you in the imaginatively named Fight Club, where you're beating the crap out of a guy in a makeshift ring. From there, the story sets off. Cody has gotten into something bad, and he's in way over his head. That ""something"" is the exciting new street drug, glow, which, just like liquid soul in Midway's NARC, is a horribly addictive substance that also happens to give users superhuman strength. Unlike liquid soul, though, it also makes glowing light shoot out of their eyes. As Kyle, you'll punch a lot of dudes in the face as you try to find Cody to get him out of this mess.     Final Fight: Streetwise attempts to deliver nonlinear action in a free-roaming environment. You'll always have a primary destination that will move the story along, but you'll also run into citizens in need of help who'll give you the occasional side mission. The side missions all seem to be fairly dumb, especially the ones that don't involve fighting. One is a slide puzzle. And in a couple of spots, you'll encounter people who won't help you out until you help exterminate the vermin in their shop. That means you'll get to run around and stomp on rats and cockroaches to an up-tempo ska beat. It's just stupid. Of course, the main objectives aren't much better. You go from one spot to the next, beating people up and triggering cutscenes. The dialogue and speech are almost universally awful and don't even work on an ironic level. They're just packed full of lame, gratuitous cursing. Not even the presence of the greatest video game mayor of all time can help save the pathetic story and objectives.      Of course, if the action were interesting, you'd probably be able to look past the busted story. But the fighting system is awfully basic, and most of your opponents will go down if you simply get in their face and slam on the weak attack button over and over again. They make up for their individual stupidity by often attacking you in quantities. In some spots you'll go up against around eight or 10 guys at once. But they don't all attack at the same time, and your attacks can (and will) hit multiple enemies in many cases, so the fighting is rarely challenging. The boss fights are a little more pattern-based, so you'll have to do some blocking and strategizing here, but not enough to pique your interest. As you play, you learn new moves and are given the opportunity to purchase more combos, but these are rarely useful, since the whole ""pound one button until everyone around you is dead"" tactic works even better if you spend your cash on increased attack damage.        Streetwise takes place in a run-down city full of nondescript buildings. Of course, since the game is free-roaming to a certain extent, requiring you to find specific locations, the generic look of everything can be exasperating. Thankfully, a bright arrow appears next to your next destination, but getting there is still up to you. The character models are ugly during gameplay, though during some of the cutscenes they at least manage to have good facial animation. The game has an often-broken camera angle, especially in tight corridors. Getting pinned in a near corner by attack dogs is especially annoying, since you can barely see yourself, let alone the dogs. In addition to the aforementioned lame speech and dialogue, the rest of Final Fight doesn't sound much better. The licensed soundtrack is weak and often doesn't fit with the action, and the fight effects are pretty generic, too.     Adding to the insanity of this package is the original arcade game, which is available as an unlockable bonus. Despite a pretty good emulation of the arcade version appearing in Capcom's classic arcade compilation last year, the version in Streetwise isn't that version. It runs at a ridiculously choppy frame rate and doesn't play well at all. In addition to that, there's also an arcade mode that focuses more intently on the weak fighting rather than the weak story. If you're a fan of the original, get Capcom's recent arcade game compilation and avert your eyes from this disaster of a game, especially if you hold any nostalgic feelings about the original game.

691,Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes,6.0,1,"Relentless absurdity and hyper-stylized action have been core tenets of the No More Heroes series. It never cared for making much sense and instead embraced its own ridiculousness with bold self-awareness, a staple of director Suda51. The slimmed-down hack-n-slash spinoff, Travis Strikes Again, hits many of the same notes, but not as hard and with varying degrees of success. Its combat is frenetic, but well worn toward the end. Its story and style is unique, but thin in crucial moments. Its humor lands in spots, but not quite with a punch. But despite a middling delivery of what past games have done, there's fun and charm packed into Travis Strikes Again, and if anything, it is a great example of local co-op action on Switch.Seven years after the events of No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle, Travis Touchdown has removed himself from the world of assassination. The series' too-cool-for-school protagonist now spends his days playing video games in a trailer nestled away in the backwoods of Texas. The father of past enemy Bad Girl, aptly named Bad Man, tracks him down for revenge, but he and Travis get sucked into an alternate dimension within Travis' possessed Death Drive Mk II video game console. They end up working together to uncover the true nature of the haunted console and its games, and that's how you get the co-op premise where you can play as either Travis or Bad Man in the six Death Drive games that serve as missions.Travis Strikes Again primarily plays as a top-down hack-n-slash action game that pits you against hordes of enemies, referred to as ""bugs,"" that look like they're from a digitized hellscape. Travis is still equipped with his trusty beam katana, but can now equip four unique abilities mapped to the face buttons, which can be activated when holding down the left bumper and operate on a cooldown. As you acquire more of these skills, called Chips, combat starts to open up and become more varied; finding what works for you and stringing together attacks with a preferred loadout is satisfying, especially when dealing with tougher enemies that require more than button-mashing to defeat. A personal favorite combo is a lightning strike to immobilize an enemy followed by a sticky bomb, then a ""force push"" to toss them into a crowd before the bomb goes off. Each of these abilities are also quite effective alone since they deal more damage and create openings. Along with heavy attacks that carry a nice, weighty feel and charge attacks that build up to bring out a literal tiger in Travis, you can't help getting hyped up when powerful enemies like a Sheepman spawn into combat.Throughout the game, attempts to break up the pace of core combat are half-baked implementations of fun ideas.There's more than enough to toy with in terms of combat skills, but basic level layouts that move you from one combat arena to another wear thin. The scenery changes and stronger enemies with different movesets show up, but the formula eventually stagnates. Aside from the tail end of the first mission, ""Electric Thunder Tiger II,"" and a late mission we won't spoil, environments tend to be visually bare without much flair to match the over-the-top action. The ""Coffee and Doughnuts"" mission shifts to a side-scrolling view for a straightforward murder-mystery theme sprinkled with Twin Peaks references, but combat is limited in this perspective and rudimentary platforming doesn't make up for it.Missions are occasionally broken up with either a minigame or puzzle, but this isn't enough to stave off the repetition perpetuated by the simplistic level design. The ""Life Is Destroy"" mission that tasks you with rotating pieces of a grid-based suburb to make a path forward adds a sweet puzzle element, but gets hampered by an enemy that chases you around and causes instant death on contact. A drag racing minigame in ""Golden Dragon GP"" brings along a novel twist, though it's short-lived. Throughout the game, attempts to break up the pace of core combat are half-baked implementations of fun ideas.There's more than enough to toy with in terms of combat skills, but basic level layouts that move you from one combat arena to another wear thin. The scenery changes and stronger enemies with different movesets show up, but the formula eventually stagnates.Battles get real spicy when the ""Serious Moonlight"" chapter rolls around (at the time of writing this review, we're not at liberty to divulge its contents), but even then, the combat arena formula begins to overstay its welcome. And the conclusory mission devolves into a series of tedious mazes and Gauntlet-like fights in empty rooms. In boss battles, it's enjoyable to recognize simple attack patterns and strike when the time's right. But again, they don't quite challenge you in interesting ways or make the impact you'd expect from a No More Heroes game.Thankfully, the option for local cooperative play is streamlined and allows a second player to jump in at any time. Playing in co-op elevates the thrilling aspects in combat and makes the duller moments a bit more exciting, as you'll coordinate with your partner to pull off skills and efficiently tear down enemies. The already intuitive control scheme also translates effortlessly to a single Joy-Con. Travis and Bad Man don't differ much in combat capabilities, though there are a few Chips unique to each character, and while you'll have to decide who gets to use which of the shared Chips in the early game, there's enough to go around in later missions.Progression is laid out neatly with each mission concluding in a boss fight followed by a narrative sequence about how Travis acquires the next game. He runs into a cast of quirky characters and bizarre situations in a monochrome screen-style visual novel, and it's surprisingly intriguing. Creative visual representations of characters and places in the green-black color palette are elevated by catchy MIDI-tuned music (including the original No More Heroes theme) and amusing dialogue. It's not without a bad joke or two, or a gag that doesn't land, but the exceptional execution of a seemingly secondary element goes a long way for tying the overarching plot together, as disparate as it may seem.The overtly crude-but-not-clever humor has been toned down this time around, and it's for the better. Profanity-laced lines and toilet humor remain intact along with tongue-in-cheek jabs and references to gaming culture, and frequent fourth-wall breaking; even commentary on the struggles of being a game developer finds its way into dialogue. Travis' brash attitude works most of the time as every other character keeps him in check, including his sassy cat Jeane--who talks and has an anime-inspired portrait in the story chapters--and the game bosses Travis encounters who he expresses reverence for. However, dialogue is rarely spoken, as there's limited voice acting even in the game's scant cutscenes.As expected, the game is packed with references, purposefully ham-fisted, to drive home the overall absurdity of No More Heroes. It works at times, such as the Chips being named after Gundam (Strike Freedom, F91, and Atlas, to name a few) and a story chapter that uses Suda's own The 25th Ward: The Silver Case as a narrative device. There's even a Jeff Minter stand-in character who's crucial to the plot of finding the original Death Drive developer. A late-game reveal proves to be the boldest of them all, especially for those fond of a particular past Suda51 game. And there's a slew of shirts you can equip with key art from other independent games (like Undertale, Hyper Light Drifter, and many more). As heavy-handed as some references may be, they're at least consistent with the game's personality, and if anything, liven up its tone.This is not the return of No More Heroes you'd hoped for, but it at least shows signs of a series that still has life in it.Once you've sifted through the references and callbacks, you have a competent action game with some great ideas that are only halfway there. Slashing through waves of deformed bugs and hardened brutes has its moments, highlighted by a seamless co-op system that makes jumping into the action a breeze, and the minimalist story presentation will draw you into the journey. However, Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes doesn't quite deliver on its potential, relying too heavily on repetitive encounters. This is not the return of No More Heroes you'd hoped for, but it at least shows signs of a series that still has life in it."
4948,Kabuki Warriors,1.0,0,"Kabuki Warriors is a horrible fighting game from Genki and Lightweight, the companies responsible for games like Kengo and Bushido Blade. This Xbox fighter may feature just as much swordplay as those games, but a lack of variety, poor gameplay, and an awful presentation keep this mildly interesting concept from achieving anything beyond establishing a new low.   The main mode in Kabuki Warriors is its tour mode, in which you take a team of three Kabuki characters from city to city, ""performing"" by fighting opposing Kabuki teams. A successful performance on your part--which is accomplished by hammering on the game's attack button while occasionally stopping to hit your special attack button--lets you trade one of your fighters for one of the three you just faced. The object is to have a badass team of Kabuki warriors by the time you get to the final city, Kyoto. Fighting earns money, which is used to travel. The more money you earn in a fight, the farther you can travel in one turn. You can choose to save all your money by only progressing one stop at a time, or you can spend it all to get from place to place and traverse the Japanese countryside much, much faster. Money is earned by winning a bout, but you can also earn extra cash by performing combos and taunting. The twist here is that the money comes from your audience, and you'll actually see coins flying at your character when you've done something to warrant some change.   Kabuki Warriors is a 2D fighter that makes poor use of its buttons. You have one attack button, which can be combined with directions on the D-pad to execute different attacks. A block button lets you block high, medium, and low, but a medium block will stop almost every attack. The jump button lets you jump, and you can execute attacks while in the air. Finally, a roll button lets you roll away from opponents, and buttons are reserved for taunting and unleashing a special attack when your popularity meter is full. The combo system, which revolves around that one attack button, is poor and essentially consists of slamming the A button repeatedly to execute multiple attacks. Holding down and forward while attacking executes a launcher attack with most characters, allowing you to juggle opponents for two or three extra slashes. While there are a few different-looking characters, the game is rife with palette swaps, and most of the characters play extremely similarly.   The game has a certain sharpness to it, but everything it's showing onscreen is so bad that crisp corners on the fighters and backgrounds really don't help. As all your fights take place on a wooden stage, every level is essentially identical. The only thing that changes is the painted backdrop behind your fighters, which is occasionally replaced by an actual 3D scene on some levels. The character models are blocky and have horrible animation. Things like arms and legs look unattached to their torsos on some fighters, and the faces of the fighters are laughably bad. The soundtrack is a mix of traditional Japanese music and gaudy guitar rock or electronic drums. Rounding out the ""painful to look at, painful to listen to"" package is a generic sword clash noise, the sound of feet stomping on wood, and a superannoying scream that is played anytime you select anything on a menu.    One could easily go on for another thousand words detailing the shallow fighting system, ugly characters, and general laziness involved in not bothering to translate the tour mode's map screen or at least subtitle the win speeches. But it should suffice to say that Kabuki Warriors is one of the worst games to be released this year or any year, on the Xbox or any other platform. The fact that Microsoft's supposedly rigid approval process allowed this game to see the light of day is simply disgusting."
3269,Battlefield: Bad Company 2,8.0,2,"  Calling Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Vietnam a simple map pack would be doing this add-on an injustice. On the surface, it would seem like a typical piece of downloadable content: four maps (a fifth is to come later), new weapons, and new vehicles all designed around Vietnam-era combat. Yet while the destructible environments and silky-smooth game engine are clearly those of Battlefield: Bad Company 2, this content changes the way you approach battle, stressing long-range combat less and forcing players forward into exciting ground combat scenarios that are among Bad Company 2's best. This shift in focus makes BC2 Vietnam feel terrifically fresh, and the new maps do their part to keep firefights intense while rewarding careful teamwork. Limited unlocks and a few technical problems keep the new content from having the same impact as the original multiplayer suite, but it you're in it for the action, there's absolutely no reason why you shouldn't attend this rumble in the jungle.         Some of the differences between vanilla Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and the Vietnam add-on are striking. Most obviously, there's less emphasis on long-range combat. The recon class retains scopes, but other classes must rely on their old-fashioned iron sights to get a more accurate shot. As a result, you are far less likely to get sniped by a medic or assault soldier using a conventional--but scoped--weapon. A lucky player can still land an annoying headshot across the map with an AK-47, but by and large, BC2 Vietnam is a more up-close-and-personal experience, and consequently, it's a more explosive one.      This isn't just because of the weapon adjustments, however; the superbly designed maps deliver the sense of a down-and-dirty skirmish between two sides fighting the terrain as much as they are fighting each other. The Hill 137 map is a fantastic example of how striking visuals and intricate map design make for intense firefights. The battlefield has been devastated by napalm. Flaming underbrush in the distance sends billows of thick smoke into the air, and dense dust thrown up from an exploding grenade clouds your view. Meanwhile, well-placed choke points force squads to the front lines, charging en masse and hoping to inch forward until they can take an important objective. The charred terrain gives snipers plenty of room to aim in some areas, while rocky hills, trenches, and rickety huts provide multiple ambush and flanking opportunities for other classes. There are also destructible structures that provide temporary respite, though this element (afforded by Bad Company 2's amazing physics engine) is not as prevalent as it was in the core game.         Rush mode showcases these features at their best. Numerous narrow passages lead to tense shoot-outs, and progressing from the initial bunkers into the flaming jungle beyond is a good reward for destroying an M-COM (communications) station. Rushes are a particular delight for medics, who become perhaps even more important than ever, reviving teammates getting mowed down at choke points or when greater expanses like those in Phu Bai Valley become littered with fallen comrades. That isn't to say, however, that BC2 Vietnam encourages you to rush forward without thought or consequence. Even with the greater sense of urgency such charges deliver, you have to consider your actions with care and stick with your squad when possible. Hurrying ahead might bring you face-to-face with someone wielding a flamethrower, one of many new weapons featured in the add-on. (Incidentally, if you're looking for a good close-quarters substitute for the shotgun, this is a good one in the hands of a skilled player. Getting flamed by a talented player causes your health to dissipate rapidly, though you can jump into the water if there's a lake or river nearby.)    Battlefield Vietnam. On the Phu Bai map, Huey gunships are a formidable presence. On Vantage Point, a flame-spewing M48 Patton tank can be your best friend, especially given that antitank weapons are less varied. (The RPG-7 is the only real standby in this regard.) On the same map, a narrow bridge and a capture point at a central high ground keep the action focused and provide ample opportunities for both snipers and engineers to get down to business, provided other infantry offer the proper support.         Every class gets new weapons to play with and use of the flamethrower. If you enjoy Battlefield: Bad Company 2 for its rank progression and unlockable gadgets and weapons, you'll be glad to know that you gain rank whether you play Vietnam or vanilla BC2; thus, you unlock new weapons, gadgets, and specializations in the main game regardless of which you play. On the downside, you have access to almost every Vietnam weapon from the get-go, so there's less sense of forward progress in the metagame than in the core game. Of course, if you've already reached maximum rank, you're here not for the unlockables but for the enjoyment. And as in the main game, Vietnam enhances your enjoyment with good visuals and fantastic sound effects. You could nitpick simple ground textures and various jagged edges among other visual foibles, but the game moves along effortlessly, with few hints of slowdown. The way the sunlight gleams through foliage softens the deadly destruction on Phu Bai, and splinters of wood fly about when a shell destroys the hut sheltering you. As attractive as BC2 Vietnam is, its visuals are surpassed by its marvelous sound design. The in-game radio is one highlight, playing such period tunes as ""Wild Thing"" and ""Surfin' Bird,"" and nothing says ""the '60s"" like a good helping of Creedence Clearwater Revival. But it's the sound effects that make the audio truly special. The ""thunk"" you hear when launching a grenade is as distinctive as ever, and the subtle sounds of your footsteps in the underbrush mix with the overwhelming fury of Huey fire to great effect.      BC2 Vietnam has suffered from some problems with its stat tracking. Player ranks and statistics haven't always been accurate, though this is a mild annoyance, considering how much less important player progression and unlocks are to the overall experience when compared to the original release. Nevertheless, if you strayed from Battlefield: Bad Company 2 once you reached maximum level or are new to the game and want a good reason to show off your elite shooting skills, the Vietnam add-on is your ticket to big explosions, big shoot-outs, and big thrills. And you get it all for 1200 Microsoft Points ($15).     "
25,Resident Evil 4,8.0,2,"Capcom's Resident Evil 4 remake takes one of the greatest games of all time and rebuilds it into a masterpiece that stands right alongside the original. Helpfully, Capcom had excellent source material to work from, which isn't the case for the original's add-on, Separate Ways. Don't get me wrong, Ada Wong's solo outing was a fun excuse to re-enter the dilapidated world of RE4, but the original add-on did little to differentiate its gameplay from the main campaign and didn't make itself essential to the overall experience from a narrative perspective either. The remake of Separate Ways, however, is the opposite, adding several new tools to its core gameplay, shaking up familiar environments with completely new set pieces, and fleshing out the story. Far from being a throwaway add-on, Resident Evil 4 remake's version of Separate Ways makes an already phenomenal game feel even more complete.The foundation of Separate Ways' premise remains the same as in the original: You step into the high heels of antiheroine Ada Wong and act as a spy to hunt down a biological weapon for longtime Resident Evil antagonist Albert Wesker. Her allegiances, however, are ambiguous, with Ada playing multiple sides in the story, sometimes working against Wesker and assisting Leon on his mission to save the president's daughter Ashley Graham or partnering up with suave biologist Luis Sera. She has a dual motive for nearly everything she does. But this time around, the stakes have been turned up a notch, as Ada is also infected with plagas--the same parasitic disease that's infected the villagers, Leon, and Ashley in the main story. This additional layer gives Ada a stronger motive for working alongside Luis, who is the answer to finding a cure. This, in turn, merits a whole lot more welcomed screen time for our charismatic and ever-charming Spanish biologist too.As a spy, Ada is equipped with many gadgets that transform the core gameplay, most prominently her grappling hook, which she can use to zipline to higher ground and over obstacles, or to pull herself toward enemies to deliver a badass swirling kick. Additionally, she has access to an augmented-reality implant that allows her to see footsteps or fingerprints, both of which are used to track characters like Luis or reveal button presses, acting as mini-puzzles to bypass locked doors. It's a bespoke gameplay system for Ada that adds an extra wrinkle to her campaign and emphasizes a detective-like quality that we haven't seen in any previous Resident Evil. The inclusion of these mechanics adds much-needed texture to Ada, painting her as the capable and resourceful spy we've always been told she is, but have never seen firsthand. Usually, she appears at the most convenient moments to help another character out or provide a weapon, but now we get to see how she uses her own skills to track characters down and complete missions from the shadows.As a result of the extra gadgetry, the tone of the game leans unabashedly into its spy aesthetic, using Sean Connery-era Bond twangy guitars to underpin Ada's mission--it makes everything feel cool and suave, which Ada Wong is. Contrary to Leon's one-liner-action-hero demeanor, Ada is reserved, serious, and calculated, which voice actress Lily Gao nails in her performance. There's a dryness in her tone and an imperious air to her delivery. It's a grounded representation of the character that stands out among the melodrama of its other cast, especially Albert Wesker, who seems to be carrying the weight of the franchise's theatrics in every airy line he delivers, and somehow it still works.Naturally, the emphasis on espionage also brings with it a lot more stealth. Familiar levels from before, like the castle walls, have been redesigned to encourage the player to sneak around and take down ganados methodically. However, at times, its encouragement to employ stealth felt more like a means to bolster its spy-like vibe than serve any purposeful challenge. Too often, enemies were positioned conveniently facing away from me or simply walking in circles, with an obvious blindspot I could enter to take them down. It felt like stealth-on-rails and was unrewarding as a result. But stealth is optional, so you don't have to play it cool and quiet, and you can jump in, knives swinging and guns blazing. The game feels better with that approach, too, as it's where Ada's new abilities shine.Ada's new ability to grapple toward enemies, which appears as a button prompt when staggering enemies, makes combat feel punchier, more dynamic, and more damn stylish than before. There's an added risk/reward when closing the gap between you and a crowd of ganados, followed by a waltz of gunfire, knife parries, and melee violence. Additionally, the zipline allows for quick traversal out of claustrophobic encounters via prompts scattered all around you. This also opens the door to pitting you against familiar enemies in unfamiliar environments. The hedge maze, for example, was a new combat arena where I could zipline over walls while trying to hunt down one enemy and dodging the grasp of others. The last major addition to Ada's zipline is the ability to yank shields from enemies, which is a skill that comes in the form of a charm that can be purchased from the Merchant. It's reminiscent of Batman's grapple gun in Rocksteady's Arkham games in its ability to rob enemies of their defenses.Separate Ways also tells a story not explored in the original at all and serves as its biggest achievement in defining itself as an essential extension to Leon's campaign. While the original was similar in showing how Ada assisted Leon, this remake creates deeper connections and new plotlines that make it vital to understand the full scope of what's at stake. Ada's infection is used as a throughline to establish Pesanta, the black-hooded foe from Leon's campaign who mysteriously disappeared, as a relentless antagonist who stalks Ada throughout her mission.Separate Ways takes significant liberties in fleshing out its story, often by reintroducing iconic scenes from the original's main campaign that were omitted in the remake. Some of these iconic scenes, like the infamous laser hall, actually fit better stylistically within the context of Ada's Mission Impossible-esque story. In some ways, this DLC serves as a nice love letter to longtime fans more than the actual remake does because of the inclusion of these scenes. At times, though, it can also feel heavy-handed, with some moments being reimagined less successfully than others.Where things like the aforementioned laser hall fit with Ada's gymnastic prowess and high-tech abilities, and the drilling spike wall works nicely with the pulpy spy tone, the U-3 fight felt wedged in. Separate Ways does a far better job of contextualizing U-3 as a throughline in ways I'd rather not spoil, but it doesn't quite find its footing in the execution, resulting in the campaign's most bland boss fight and the omission of the scariest part of its original. It is reduced to a languishing and uninspired arena fight. Still, it's a minor misstep in comparison to the many excellent boss fights Separate Ways manages to fit into its modest but action-packed four hours, some of which outshine even the main game's fights. Ada's showdown with Saddler, for example, is particularly memorable due in part to some cutscene badassery in its final moments.Separate Ways isn't just more Resident Evil 4. It's a meaningful expansion that delivers a new story through a distinct tone and with new mechanics. It is an essential extension of an already remarkable game. Although its nods to the past can feel a bit overt, it still packs a punch that'll have me playing it many times over again."
3274,Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II,6.0,1,"  Sometimes, you get what you pay for. The first premium downloadable content for Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, the Endor Bonus Mission, will set you back 80 Microsoft points ($1), which seems about right for this short bit of Force-flinging bluster. The add-on's highlights are its environments, which contrast nicely with each other and make it easier to overlook how tight and linear the levels they dress up really are. And perhaps like so many Star Wars fans, you've always dreamed of jamming a lightsaber into the torso of a yammering Ewok, in which case, you'll be glad to finally get that chance many times over. Unfortunately, this brief mission pack is on the sloppy side. The appearances of several beloved Star Wars characters are soiled by poor character models and terrible animations. The two boss fights are too easy, as is the basic (but entertaining) combat surrounding them. Fans will appreciate the price, but this mission doesn't improve upon its disappointing foundation. (Please note: The following text includes a mild spoiler for those who haven't played Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II.)     Star Wars trilogy.      It's the final meeting with another fan-favorite character that is the most disappointing, however. A character that should not be wielding a lightsaber at this stage is suddenly a Jedi knight and speaks a line of dialogue as if to explain away this incredible twisting of Star Wars history. The final cutscene, featuring a previously powerful Star Wars icon gone suddenly submissive, is the bizarre end to this narrative. In the past, this series' downloadable content has always presented alternate-history scenarios to more or less positive effect, given that the premises seemed reasonably plausible. This twist isn't amusing or fascinating; it's just odd and out of place. The low quality of the animations speaks volumes about the lack of care given to the appearances of these characters. In cinematics, they move as if they're missing every third frame of animation, and jarring camera transitions further emphasize the lack of fluidity. Furthermore, poor facial animations and hair that looks pasted on (among other visual factors) make it look like PlayStation 2 character models were thrown into this attractive modern-day game. And don't expect the voice-overs to match their film counterparts; in one case, it's not even close.        The Ewoks you battle in the first half of the mission pack have some problems of their own. Killing one might cause it to zoom directly into the air and fall back to earth, for example. Yet the action here, while easy, is more enjoyable than that in the full game and has a fair bit of variety considering its length. Ewoks fling projectiles at you with their slings, bombard you from above in gliders, and charge directly at you, giving you plenty of chances to silence their annoying cries. There are a few puzzles and platforming bits to break up the pace as well, including a well-developed series of timed dashes requiring you to use Force push. The two lovely environments you do battle in also enhance the fun. Endor's forests are easy on the eyes, while an abundance of glowing red lights and crackling electricity enliven the facility featured in the second half of the adventure. It's too bad the two boss fights aren't very challenging. The change of pace to focused one-on-one fights is nice, but these aren't taxing battles, so if you are a Force Unleashed II veteran, plan on increasing the difficulty level straight away. The second boss in particular is too predictable, which dampens the potential joy in emerging victorious.      The Endor Bonus Mission is a missed opportunity to enhance an unsatisfying game, yet the low-low price tag takes the edge off the drawbacks. This add-on is no more creative than the various downloadable missions bolted on to the first Force Unleashed game. The story takes the alternate-history approach beyond the limits of taste, and a few careless aspects intrude on the otherwise attractive visuals. Nevertheless, you still get some good-looking locales, some entertaining action, and the chance to send squealing Ewoks to an early grave for only a buck. The low cost doesn't make this content good, but it does make it a worthwhile consideration for anyone hoping to practice their saber swinging.    "
2097,NES Remix,6.0,1,"    At $15, NES Remix is a pricey piece of packaged nostalgia. For me, playing through these mini-challenges and unlocking new stages and new games was an enjoyable whirlwind tour of some of my fondest gaming memories. But then again, I've been on this vacation before."
2987,Galaga Legions DX,8.0,2,"Pac-Man Championship Edition DX, the Namco Generations team has turned its attention to another Namco franchise. The result is Galaga Legions DX, which uses 2008's Galaga Legions as a jumping-off point and evolves it into a dual-stick shooter with a constantly ticking clock putting the pressure on. It doesn't quite reach the same heights as the team's previous effort, but it's an engaging entry in the Galaga series that once again makes the age-old pursuit of higher and higher scores tough to resist.        In Galaga Legions DX, you pilot a starfighter against waves of insectoid enemies called galaga. That's the extent of this game's similarities to the 1981 arcade classic. Here, as in the original Galaga Legions, you're accompanied at all times by two invulnerable satellites that fire each time your ship fires. In Legions, you could position your satellites anywhere on the screen, but here, the action is simpler. The satellites never leave your side, and you direct them with the right stick. You can either have both satellites fire in the same direction or you can set the satellites to mirror each other. You can switch between these two formations at any time. Because incoming waves of galaga frequently alternate between coming from a single direction and from multiple directions, you need to react quickly and reconfigure your satellites on the fly to deal with them efficiently, making this a less tactical but more immediate and frantic game than its predecessor.      Legions DX also ratchets up the tension by taking a cue from the Pac-Man Championship Edition games. Here, every game is broken into five levels, and each level has a set number of waves. Each level also has an imposed time limit, and the challenge lies not so much in surviving each wave but in defeating it quickly to earn as many points as possible before your final seconds tick away. Before each wave begins, blue lines quickly cross the screen, indicating the movement pattern of the incoming enemies, and markers indicate where the galaga will emerge from, giving you an instant to position yourself and your satellites to deal with them. Your goal is to destroy the enemies efficiently, because any allotted time for a level that you have left over when you've completed one of the first four levels is added to the amount of time you get to spend on level five, and on level five, all point values are doubled. As a result, every extra second you accrue to extend your time in level five could mean tens of thousands of extra points that send you higher up the leaderboards.      Waves of enemies are typically made up of a large number of small ships and one or two larger ships. Destroying these larger enemies sets off chain reactions that destroy the entire squad, netting you half the points for those foes but eliminating them efficiently. Galaga bombs also frequently appear; destroying these creates an explosion that consumes nearby enemies, and targeting them is often the key to wiping out waves quickly. Initially, the amount of activity onscreen can be bewildering, but as you play, you naturally get better at reacting to the indicators that precede each wave and at quickly eliminating the galaga. Evolving into a more efficient and precise killing machine is rewarding, and it's tempting to attempt each area repeatedly in an effort to earn a precious few additional seconds to spend in level five and achieve higher and higher scores.        The action keeps you on your toes. Incoming enemies use constantly changing patterns, and waves alternate between those in which enemies swarm around you in such vast numbers that your ship becomes completely surrounded, and those in which galaga bombs make filling the screen with explosions and instantly wiping out all your enemies effortless. One moment, you feel overwhelmed; the next, you feel overwhelmingly powerful. That sense of power is enhanced occasionally when a galaga trap comes along. Destroying these generates a black hole that takes hold of any nearby enemies, who then join you, dramatically increasing your offensive power. These helpers are fragile, and most of them are likely to get wiped out quickly as they come in contact with enemies, but the boost they provide is enjoyable while it lasts.     One thing you won't frequently feel is threatened. Even when you're surrounded on all sides by enemies, it's typically easy to cut a swath through them and emerge from the swarm alive. So while the action is involving, it rarely has the edge-of-your-seat excitement that comes with struggling to survive and escaping death by the skin of your teeth. That's not to say that you won't die. False moves can cost you a life; more significantly, they cost you precious time, and when you respawn, the action moves at a slightly slower pace than it did before.      If you want to pick up some pointers about how to earn higher scores, you can watch replays of the top scorers on the leaderboards. It's a handy feature, and it reveals the sometimes counterintuitive strategies that you can employ to maximize your scoring potential. For instance, all of the current highest scorers in the Tournament mode stop upon reaching the 10th wave of level five, destroy two enemies for a total of 400,000 points, and then sacrifice their ship and restart the wave, repeating the process until they get down to their last ship. It's unfortunate that the best strategy isn't always to simply fight on through as many waves as you can, but at least the game makes it easy for you to learn from other players.        Legions DX gives you six visual styles to choose from before each game. One of these is a bland high-resolution take on the ships and enemies of Galaga. The other five options use the colorful original sprites from games such as Galaga and Galaxian, and the way destroyed enemies disintegrate into pixilated pieces when playing with one of these visually retro options selected makes blasting the creatures to smithereens all the more satisfying. Regardless of which visual option you select, the background is a constantly evolving display of asteroid fields, color-shifting star fields, and other dynamic sights. The result is a game that resembles what a kid in the '80s might have imagined games in the future would look like.     It doesn't take long to blast your way through all of Galaga Legions DX's 10 areas; in that sense, it is a short and easy game. But the real struggle here is for leaderboard domination, which is not so easy. It's too bad that Legions DX doesn't do what many other score-focused games these days do and inform you when you near or surpass a friend's score (or when a friend has overthrown you). That could have fueled the fires of competition and made giving these areas just one more try even tougher to resist. But even without that kind of leaderboard integration, the gameplay is fun to come back to, whether you're aiming to beat a friend's high score or to just set a new personal best. Legions DX doesn't have much in common with its storied arcade forebear, but it's a worthy bearer of the Galaga title nonetheless.  "
622,The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening,8.0,2,"Having been transformed from little pixelated people to shiny, cartoony toys come to life, everyone in Link's Awakening brings newfound energy. It's equally true for monsters and bad guys as well. Game Boy games have retro appeal, but the remake casts aside ancient aesthetics for something entirely different that works on its own terms. That which existed only in our imagination before comes through in new animations, accompanied with lively sound effects and music that make you feel like a kid again. It's the sort of look that grows even more attractive over time, and you might, like I did, start to imagine what other Nintendo properties would benefit from a similar visual upgrade.It can, also, be the one thing about the game that irks, as the frame rate takes a noticeable hit when most scenes load into memory. The problem seems to be tied to the game's pronounced depth-of-field effect, which employs an exaggerated blurring effect to enhance the miniature-toy feel of the presentation. Don't get me wrong, this is more of a minor annoyance than anything--which should tell you a lot about the quality of everything else.Link's Awakening will no doubt feel old-fashioned, which is fair considering the original version is over a quarter century old at this stage. It feels wrong to make any comparisons between it and Breath of the Wild, but in the case that 2017's game of the year was your first foray in Link's boots, kiss the open-ended quests and sprawling Hyrule goodbye. Link's Awakening is a tightly designed adventure on a small but dense map. Eight puzzle-filled dungeons comprise the bulk of your journey, but you're also required to meet and greet the inhabitants of the quirky island. Link washes ashore after a calamitous boating accident to find himself stranded in paradise--or it would be, if not for the Nightmares residing in the aforementioned vaults.This setup suggests that Koholint is but a trite land compared to the embattled and sacred Kingdom of Hyrule--an inconvenient pitstop for old Link, if you will. Yet, Link's Awakening never feels like it's trying to butt up against the series' more epic entries. It works, instead, as a fanciful side story, and it ultimately stands out for its playful attitude and moments of bittersweet melancholy.By and large, the flow of the game is managed in a clear fashion. A sage-like owl helps guide Link from one primary task to the next. With each dungeon comes a musical instrument, and with them all, says the wise owl, Link can secure his way off the island. It always appears at just the right time, when one task ends and the other is about to begin, but you're also afforded advice from a shy man named Ulrira. Chat with him at any of the numerous phone-booth trees scattered around the island; just don't bother him in person--he will sheepishly ask that you stick to the phone, anyway. For the remake, you also have the new option of revisiting past conversations via the map menu, and the ability to mark locations on the map using a small selection of different icons.This may prove useful for several reasons, most notably while you're hunting for collectible items like seashells and pieces of heart. There are more of each in the Switch remake than in the original Game Boy game, and though you may have a clear sense of where some are, many will remain inaccessible until you discover new gear that extends Link's capabilities.With the Switch's expanded button count, Link's Awakening is a lot easier to play now because you have access to more items at once without jumping in and out of your inventory. In the past, you could only have two items in hand at any given moment. On Switch, Link's sword, shield, dash, and Power Bracelet strength are always ready to use, and two configurable slots for other items let you juggle even more in any given moment. This greatly diminishes the annoyance of constant menu-flipping and can make certain boss encounters feel easier than ever. For players that want a challenge in battle, a Hero mode exists, where enemies don't drop health replenishments and Link takes twice as much damage as usual.Largely, however, the more manageable enemy encounters aren't to the game's detriment. Link's Awakening is primarily focused on testing you with its circuitous dungeons and an overarching item-trading quest line that requires you to take a closer look at the people who call Koholint home. Their identities and stories aren't all that deep, but your interactions and exchanges help shape the identity of the locale and brighten up your time spent outside of dark and dreary dungeons. Some of the multi-floor dungeons can take the better part of an hour to figure out, with fluctuating obstacles and subtle environmental cues ensuring that the final stages will either test your memory of the original game or your present observation and deduction skills. There are times when you suspect that you've explored every option yet can't find the path forward. As is par for the course, you probably need to take a closer look at your tools and surroundings. Even if it won't test your fighting spirit, Link's Awakening's most challenging puzzles will test your intellect in surprising ways.Like many of the best Zelda games, Link's Awakening gives you a sense of purpose, motivates you with discovery and growth, and delights you with its charming personality. These qualities, unfortunately, don't carry over to the remake's other big addition: the dungeon maker mode. Here, with the help of the series' favorite gravedigger, Dampe, Link can create virtual dungeons derived from rooms seen throughout his adventure. Amiibo can also factor in, either as portable storage for sharing your dungeons with other players--no, you can't upload them online--or as a means of unlocking special additions for your custom dungeons. The Link's Awakening Amiibo, for example, will introduce Shadow Link as a mini boss. Defeating him, or simply playing dungeons, will net you extra consumables, like bombs and arrows, and a bounty of rupees. These are good options to have, and there's some delight that comes with laying out your own dungeon, but because you are limited to premade room tiles and disposable rewards, the dungeon maker mode is easy to dismiss. It's a curiosity at best, and definitely not the Zelda Maker you might be waiting for.Though the remake has a couple of blemishes, it's still an easy game to recommend. People speak of Link's Awakening as the secret best Zelda game. That's a tough call to make, but it's definitely one of the best. If you haven't touched a classic Zelda game in a while, Link's Awakening will almost instantly transport you back to the '90s. It's simple, in many ways, but the orchestrated journey still conveys a sense of adventure, and this new version is without question the best way to experience it. And more than anything else, it will put a smile on your face. Remakes are a dime a dozen nowadays and often easy to overlook. Don't make that mistake with Link's Awakening."
3353,John Daly's ProStroke Golf,6.0,1,"   Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11 for the Wii, as you're afforded outstanding accuracy as the game reads every little movement of the controller. Driving, chipping, hitting out of the rough, and even putting, an old nemesis for the Tiger Woods games on the Wii, are depicted in a lifelike manner. The controller even tracks how you shift your weight when swinging, so you have to move in a smart, precise fashion to avoid slices and hooks. Best of all, your shots are well balanced. You don't have to contort your body to get up to 100 percent on drives, and just a little bit of effort goes a long way when making approach shots and putting.     Even though you might get a little frustrated at times, this is usually a result of your own error or the sand traps and water hazards conspiring to ruin your day, not the controls. Aiming is a little too twitchy, which makes it harder than it should be to lock in on where you want to drop that loft shot onto the green or launch the ball at a hole when putting. Otherwise, the swing mechanics are good. There is the option to switch to a standard analog swing with a gamepad, but the Move controls are superior and certainly worth persevering with if you find them difficult initially. The ball on the controller even changes color between green, purple, and red depending on what you're doing, which is both a useful reminder of when you're hitting for real or taking a practice swing and a flat-out cool bit of visual chrome.     That said, swinging is more finicky than you might be comfortable with in a video game, especially if you're not a golfer in real life, or at least not a very good one. The big issue is with the backswing, because the game places a huge importance on bringing your hands back properly and turning your wrists. Half swings common to weekend hackers don't get the job done. If you fail to pull the Move back smartly, you won't get enough muscle on the ball, or you'll slice into the woods. Also, you can't put as much English on the ball as you can in the Tiger games. This gives your shots more of a realistic golf vibe and makes your rounds mimic those you hit in real life. This isn't always good, since the incredibly fussy manner of golf can make it one of the most aggravating pastimes on the planet at times, but if you're looking for rigorous realism, you've got it here. There are four skill settings, too, so you can tweak things until you find a good level of challenge that lets you compete.       Unfortunately, ProStroke Golf doesn't have much going for it aside from its motion-sensing controls. Game modes are paltry. You can shoot one-off rounds of stroke, match, foursome, and four-ball either solo or along with some buddies on the same console; go online for some multiplayer action; and take part in career play. The latter two offerings leave a lot to be desired. Online games are beset by a low number of people playing and a lack of interesting frills, such as live tournaments, to hold your interest. The so-called Career mode isn't a career option at all. All you do is take on Daly in special challenges, such as longest drive and nearest the pin, at each of the game's 12 courses. If you win, you unlock that course's tournament. If you fail, you go back to square one. Daly is very tough to beat, too, because he plays better here than he does in real life these days. His skill seems to have been bumped up across the board simply to pad out the gameplay. So unless you're very good at the game from the beginning, you're in for a lot of maddening repetition before you can unlock such basic golf-game amenities as career tournaments.     The look and sound are awful. Menus are a total mess, with a jumpy controller cursor that makes it tough to select options. Golfer models are jaggy and don't look the least bit realistic. Daly's own avatar looks nothing like him, coming off like a portly, middle-aged Dennis the Menace with a bowl haircut rather than the imposing guy that he still is on the tees in real life. Course features have the same problems. The leaves on trees, for instance, look so sharp that they could cut you, and the light rough alongside the fairway has the uniform appearance of a cheap carpet. The course selection itself is also fairly skimpy, with just about a dozen links from around the world. One plus is that the courses aren't the big famous ones depicted in other golf games, but instead somewhat lesser lights such as Harpers Lake, The Brabazon at the Belfry, and The Shire that you probably haven't played virtually before. So there is some novelty factor, even if the courses aren't real standouts like some of the more famous circuits seen in other games. Commentary from Sam Torrance and Peter Kessler is barely there. The unknown duo's most noteworthy contribution is counting the number of shots you take on each hole. And the music is bland and repetitive Muzak, with no option to cue up a custom soundtrack.     After John Daly's ProStroke Golf winds up in the bargain bin, it might be worth checking out simply to see how well the Move controller can be used to replicate golf swings. It just doesn't stand up as a full-fledged, full-priced game, however, because everything else about it seems cheap and outdated in comparison to its Tiger Woods-monikered competition over at EA Sports. Just like John Daly's friends have probably been telling him after his recent efforts on the PGA Tour: You can do better.  "
3073,Fallout: New Vegas,7.0,2,"Fallout 3's better content packs. Yet, this enjoyable excursion gives you several welcome chances to exercise the power of choice, and it rewards you with new perks, new weapons, and an increased level cap.         The two men at the center of Honest Hearts are good, sincere blokes that nonetheless don't see eye to eye on how to deal with the White Legs, a violent tribe of nomads eager to scalp anyone that dares oppose them. One of these men is Daniel, a Mormon missionary with close ties to a tribe called The Sorrows. The other is Joshua Graham, otherwise known as The Burned Man. Joshua favors an aggressive approach toward the White Legs, which is no surprise given his violent past with Caesar's Legion. He is beloved by the Dead Horses tribe and preaches that mankind should shun the greed of the outside world. You stumble upon both men after the trading caravan you join falls victim to the White Legs, though neither makes a very strong impression. Joshua needs supplies like lunch boxes and walkie-talkies; Daniel sends you to find maps and disarm traps. These are nice men that nonetheless make you wonder how they managed to inspire the devotion of the locals. Joshua tells you that he was put on Earth to show people how to fight, yet he speaks in even tones, without an ounce of passion. For someone called The Burned Man, his personality lacks fire, and the tasks he needs performed are hardly extraordinary.     As mundane as the narrative is, you still get welcome opportunities to make decisions, though they would have more weight if you felt more invested in the consequences. Standard quests allow for a bit of flexibility. You might kill the gigantic Yao Guai creatures threatening the camp or collapse the cave in which they live. You could convince a tribesman to follow his heart and explore the ""civilized"" world or encourage him to stay with his people. The final series of decisions determine the future of several characters and their tribes, and these are outlined in an epilogue that closes the adventure in traditional Fallout fashion. Some of these characters include a few that join you as followers, and they, like Joshua and Daniel, are remarkably even tempered. It's nice to have their company, however--particularly that of Waking Cloud, a pious Sorrow tribeswoman indebted to Daniel for her saving her life. It's too bad that some of the quests these characters join you for are so routine. Find a key, open a cabinet, search for a compass: These are simple fetch quests that needed some dressing up with better context.        A few quests offer some variety, however, including one that pits you against a giant creature in Honest Hearts' best battle. The reward is an excellent melee weapon that nicely complements an intimidating helmet you might also grab before you head back to the Mojave. Other tangible goodies in this content include weapons (such as tomahawks) and new perks (extra damage when limbs are crippled). In addition, the level cap has been increased by five. Zion also serves as its own reward; its prickly cacti and red-orange plateaus provide a great backdrop to your travels. This graphics engine is showing its age, what with the bland textures, inconsistent shadows, and awkward animations. Yet campsites dotted with empty beer bottles and abandoned communal grills are an effective reminder of the civilization from which Joshua wants to shield his followers.       This being a Fallout game, it's no surprise that you could run into a number of bugs. These include some enemies you cannot damage or target in the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System because they are standing in water; enemies hovering in midair or clipping into rocks; and non-player characters running around in circles as if their loincloths are on fire. Don't let such typical bugs dissuade you from considering Fallout: New Vegas - Honest Hearts, however. The story and related quests don't surprise, but this add-on gives you the opportunity to once again influence those you meet and accomplish your goals as you see fit. And, you do those things in a desert environment harboring enough creatures and caves to make it worth exploring.     "
2339,Mark of the Ninja,8.0,2,"   Batman: The Animated Series, although it ultimately serves little more purpose than providing context for your actions. The rest of the story reveals itself through tidbits dropped by your female accomplice (who's a bit on the cynical side), and still other narrative touches are found in the scrolls hidden in the nooks and crannies of each level, but nothing defines the experience so much as the ninja's unrelenting pursuit of justice in the game itself.     Mark of the Ninja's controls are unfailingly responsive, and few platformers have handled stealth mechanics with such facility. In its best moments, it's a work of kinetic poetry, with the ninja climbing walls, flying between platforms with grappling hooks, and sneaking into vents only milliseconds before a deadly laser sweeps around or before he's revealed by the flashlights of a patrolling guard. Evasion is key, as highlighted by the scorecard at the end of each round that awards points for remaining undetected and keeping all the guards alive.        Hiding places abound, such as doorways and potted plants that the ninja can flit between with a tap of the B button, which helps if you've accidentally triggered an alarm and need to hide while the alert dies down. You also find plenty of uses for unlockable tools such as smoke bombs that disrupt trigger beams and noisemakers that distract guards, although you're limited to using only two of these ""ninja tools"" besides the default (and limitless) wooden darts. If you want to change your loadout, you have to stumble across one of the rare kiosks or wait until the end of the level to switch them out or spend points on new tools.     Mark of the Ninja best quality is that it almost always gives you a choice between murder and avoidance, such as when it seems like the only way around a wall of lasers is to kill a patrolling guard and drag his body under them to deactivate the sensors. Look long enough, though, and you sometimes find a ventilation shaft hidden behind a movable crate that lets you bypass the obstacle altogether. Often, though, moving in for the kill is quicker; done right, stealth assassinating the majority of guards is a rewarding affair of sneaking up on them, clicking X, and following a directional prompt based on your position.        For added safety, you can drag and stash the guards' bodies in the game's many doorways and ventilation systems before another guard finds them and switches on the alarm. Or you can nab bonus points for using an unlockable skill that leaves them hanging from the ceiling and frightening their friends (thus allowing you to rush in and finish them off). But when you botch a job, it shows, and the clean kills of a stealth assassination give way to embarrassingly rough kills that leave the target kicking, gurgling, and attracting the attention of other guards. Mark of the Ninja reminds us that ninjas should take no glory in messy kills.       It's moments like this when the beautiful simplicity of Mark of the Ninja's stealth design starts to show. As you finish up your shoddy execution (dubbed a ""peasant's death"" by the announcement that floats up afterward), you see pulsing yellow circles in the distance that indicate the location of guards who have heard the noise, so you know where not to go when making your escape. Such visual cues are tremendously useful, and the game makes excellent use of them. Break into a sprint by pressing the right trigger, and a gigantic blue circle pulses around the ninja. Aim a noisemaker with the left trigger in the direction of a guard, and you'll know he heard it fall if the pulsing circle sweeps over him. Circles even indicate the footsteps of the guards, and let you know when the guard has walked away. These cues are especially useful when avoiding the dogs that make their appearance far along the journey, making the struggle to keep them from sniffing you a bit more bearable.     There's not much variety to enemies beyond shields, dogs, and strongmen to complement the army of rank-and-file guards, but there seldom seems to be a need since the level design plays such a prominent role. Levels are fairly linear, although there are plenty of hidden passages with upgrades and artifacts to discover if you want to venture off the beaten path. There are also dozens of satisfying puzzles and deftly hidden challenge rooms that test your skill with some of the game's stealth mechanics.      Batman: Arkham Asylum with detective vision on at all times, but far sight occasionally disrupts the otherwise effortlessly fluid gameplay when a level forces you to use it every few seconds.     The one feature that would have made Mark of the Ninja more satisfying is cooperative mode. It hints at one with the story's inclusion of the female ninja, but in the end, the only nod toward multiplayer competition is the 13 leaderboards that showcase your performance on each level and in the story as a whole. There are still plenty of objectives, however, such as seals that award points based on level-specific challenges to heighten the stakes. Mark of the Ninja is that rare game that gets all the hallmarks of a platformer right while distinguishing itself as a unique and fulfilling adventure. With its tense pacing, its shadowy ambiance, and the endlessly satisfying act of slipping past an entire squad of guards, Mark of the Ninja is an excellent adventure that will leave its mark on you for months to come.     "
3729,Azurik: Rise of Perathia,5.0,1,"In the first month following a new video game system's release, an undue amount of attention is paid to subpar games that would otherwise come out and quickly fade into obscurity at any other time in the system's life cycle. Azurik: Rise of Perathia is one of those games. If you already own an Xbox, don't bother picking up the game, and if you're considering buying an Xbox, don't judge the console by this game. Every system has its share of dogs, and like a painter writing off bad paintings for being ""good to get them out of your system,"" it's good for the Xbox to get this one out of the way early.  In Azurik, you play a young apprentice mage who channels elemental powers to his magical staff to initiate special attacks and create defenses like armor. You begin the game with these powers, only to lose them after evil forces strike the stronghold where you study and live, and then you must regain them to stop your enemies from claiming the world for their own. The key selling point for Azurik is that you mix and match your elemental abilities to create special attacks and skills by hitting the correct combination of jewel buttons on the Xbox controller. For example, a mix of the fire (red button) and water (blue button) elements will melt ice walls, while another combination will create an ice attack that will extinguish any fire-based foes you encounter. Once you regain your elemental powers, learning the different combinations (which is easier said than done) makes the game's combat much more interesting, but until then, it's repetitive and unexciting, revolving around jabbing, swinging, and attacking while jumping. Yes, it's one of those games that hides its better parts past the point when most people have given up playing. The elemental realms in Azurik's world are massive, and much backtracking is necessary to solve their many puzzles, even though shortcuts are at times provided. The puzzles involve such basic tasks as jumping onto a floating platform to gain access to a key, and they are shamefully straightforward in comparison with those found in similar action-adventure games, like Soul Reaver II. Dull as they are, the puzzles are even further undercut by the game's strange physics. Need to jump onto a platform? Better plan in time for your character to float in the air for a bit before landing. Need to climb up on a ledge? Better expect a few tries before your character is able to grab hold of it. If key collection wasn't enough of busy work in and of itself, carrying out the actual task could barely be more tedious because of the sloppy physics and lackluster combat. At first, Azurik both looks and sounds very sharp. The opening sequence is narrated well and is visually impressive, and the theme song is excellent. The environments are modeled well and are clearly defined, and they carry excellent textures at times. Things go downhill from there, though. The character designs look like a fantasy version of the CG animated cartoon series, ReBoot--an aesthetic, middle-of-the-road that's neither striking nor unpleasant. It's not until the characters start moving--like jumping or swimming--that they look terrible. You'll also notice a peculiar lack of light sourcing in the game, outside of some of the spell effects. For example, if you walk into a dark cave, you'll be able to see yourself and any nearby foes as if they glow from some internal incandescence, but otherwise you exist in complete darkness. Likewise, the water and snow effects are also awful looking. The only ways that you know that you're underwater are that your character is now set horizontal instead of vertical, the ceiling is a lot lower than before, and a few minor ripples were cast along the surface when you jumped in. Snow is much the same way. When you might walk waist deep into a snowdrift, no ripples appear around you--the lower half of your character just disappears into white. Elements like these detract greatly from what otherwise would have been a fairly decent-looking game.  The sound effects in Azurik are also extremely basic and unvaried. Each creature has a cry that it repeats over and over again until dispatched, and most are so bad that you won't want to hear them the first time. The environmental noises are quite remedial as well. In one instance, you'll walk up to a bridge and hear it creak in the wind. When you walk over it, you'll hear the same sound repeated as if your weight upon it hasn't affected it at all. The guidance you receive from the game's narrator is also a problem. The voice bears a reverb effect, perhaps to make it more dramatic, but in reality, it's just hard to understand. You'll often have to listen to his tips several times to make out what he's saying.  Another major sticking point in Azurik is the camera, which you control with the right analog stick. The camera will stay in whatever perspective you shift it into until you move into an area where the computer takes control, which is where you usually swing it around into a slightly less-than-ideal view. Even if it doesn't take back control, you travel throughout many varied elevations and into tunnels, so you constantly have to jimmy the camera around to see where you're going. The camera does center with a push of the right trigger buttons, but its centered view isn't always an ideal perspective. For instance, if you're swimming underwater and you push the button, you might end up with a view of the water's surface, with your character nowhere to be seen. The camera is so much work for you throughout the game that it feels like the developers gave up on it and decided to just let you control it. In fact, that's the impression you'll get throughout much of Azurik--it comes off like a game rushed out the door before completion. The best thing that you can say about Azurik: Rise of Perathia is that it's a big game with much to see and do, but its gameplay is so frustrating and dull that few players will push on that far into it, a fact that detracts from the game's overall value. Azurik does pick up steam after time, but the first few hours of it are so awful that players shouldn't have to put through with the bad before the better. Fans of the action-adventure genre will likely be better served waiting for Crystal Dynamics' Blood Omen 2 (and hoping that the company will port Soul Reaver II to the Xbox). "
1406,Dariusburst: Chronicle Saviours,8.0,2,"At first glance, Darius Burst seems like a fairly typical scrolling shooter: scroll along horizontally, fire weapons and missiles to take out waves of enemies, collect power-ups, and fight a boss at the end. What's different here, however, is the “Burst” mechanic: tap the burst button and you fire off an extremely powerful laser that causes tremendous damage to everything in its path. This is made more interesting when you consider that the Burst module can also be detached from the ship and aimed to reach hard-to-target areas. It also allows for a bit of added strategy--you can set it up in a place where it will auto-replenish by blocking and destroying waves of incoming enemies.Environmental obstacles and challenging enemy encounters call for old-fashioned dodging reflexes in the middle of stages, but boss encounters are on another level entirely: these giant bio-mechanical monstrosities volley lasers, homing missiles, and waves of powerful energy bursts. Making things tougher is that many of the bosses come in various permutations, with each new version introducing stronger weapons and defensive maneuvers.These challenging encounters are the game’s highlights, with many tense battles that end with your ship on the brink of destruction. Confident players can learn how to Counter-Burst: a destructive but difficult attack that requires you to Burst within a few frames of an enemy’s laser. Failed Counter-Bursts typically end in your death, but learning how to do them yields immense satisfaction, if also a raised pulse.While Another Chronicle offers a semi-linear arcade mode where you pick branching paths to reach the end, the real meat lies in the robust Chronicle and Chronicle Saviours modes. Chronicle Mode is a direct port from the arcade game, and features over 3,000 individual missions for you to unlock and clear. Many of these missions include conditions that make things unusually challenging, such as removing power-ups or limiting your continues. Granted, not all of these are completely unique--stages and bosses are reused--but the wide variety of rules present in these challenges overshadows the presence of recycled elements.The sheer variety on display here--and the authentic feel of the older ships--is a real treat, especially for fans of the series.Elsewhere, Darius Burst resurfaces old material to great effect: the selection of ships in the game includes not only designs created for Darius Burst, but also ships from earlier Darius games, complete with their distinct weapons and shot patterns. Some of these make the game more difficult (the Darius I and II ships lack any Burst functionality), while others change the way you approach encounters (The Gaiden ship replaces the Burst with a screen-clearing Black Hole Bomb). There’s even a ship from the obscure Taito shooter Scramble Formation, the Murakumo, which features four detached weapon units and plays unlike anything else in the game. The sheer variety on display here--and the authentic feel of the older ships--is a real treat, especially for fans of the series.The PC version of Darius Burst allows you to recreate the arcade experience by stretching the game across two monitors, creating an ultra-wide image. Otherwise, you have to accept the game's letter-boxed format, which squeezes the ultra-wide image to fit your display, leaving black bars on the bottom and top of the screen. The one exception to this rule is Chronicle Saviour mode, which is tailored for a standard 16:9 screen. Though four-player local coop is available, the lack of online multiplayer is a disappointment, especially given that there are some missions that can only be cleared with four players.Even with these issues, however, Darius Burst is one of the best traditional shooters to come out in years. The visual design is excellent, the music is avant-garde and memorable, the boss encounters are thrilling, and it’s chock-full of challenges to keep you coming back and playing more. If you enjoy these sorts of games at all and are craving a finely-crafted, intense shooting experience that will keep you hooked for a long time, then Darius Burst: Chronicle Saviours is a worthy ."
1326,Dead by Daylight,6.0,1,"Dead by Daylight features two teams--four survivors and one killer--and pits them against one another in a battle for all the marbles: The four survivors need to repair five generators to power the gates which will allow them to escape. The killer needs to find the survivors, knock them down, put them on hooks and then sacrifice them to their otherworldly gods. The odds are skewed heavily in favour of the invincible killer, and as a result playing Dead by Daylight as a survivor can be a nerve-rattling, sweat-inducing, terrifying experience.After queuing into a game with three other survivors, Dead by Daylight puts you in one of several eerie horror environments--a dilapidated farm, a run-down manor, a rickety junkyard--and tells you, very simply, to fix the generators to escape. When you find the generators, you then need to repair them--a painstakingly slow process, where you hold the left mouse button down while crouching in front of it. If you're alone, repairing the generator can take more than a minute. As you crouch next to the very noisy generator, the game will throw skill-tests at you by way of a rotating bar--if you fail the QTE, the generator will backfire. This creates a noisy explosion, and the killer is visually alerted to the location of the backfire, turning you into a target.If the killer does find you (and he probably will) your options are limited. If you have a flashlight you can blind him temporarily, but your best bet is to run away. The killer moves faster than you can run, maintaining the traditional horror movie 'ominous walk', but you can slow him down by leaping through windows, or pushing down pallets to block his path. You want to put as many of these obstacles in between the two of you as possible as you flee for your life.Fortunately for the survivors, a sixth sense mechanic alerts them to the presence of a nearby killer--the closer the killer is, the faster your survivor's heart beats. Unfortunately the sound is obscured by generator revving as you repair it. When 90% repaired, the generator nearly drowns out the heartbeat entirely, forcing you to rely solely on your eyes to see the killer.When you play as the killer, you're able to see all the map's generators at all times, allowing you to patrol them. If any of them are making noise, you know at least one survivor has been working on it, and you can hunt for signs that the others are nearby. Panicked survivors will sprint away, leaving scratches on nearby walls and breaks in the grass, and you can follow these markings to find your prey. Once you find your prey you chop them down, pick them up and put them on a hook, sacrificing them to your god after 60 seconds.The scoring system initially encourages players to create exciting gameplay opportunities by rewarding risky play. Survivors who engage in lengthy, drawn out chases escaping the killer will earn more points for their boldness, and you can rack up the points by rescuing other survivors who have been captured but not yet sacrificed. As a killer you're rewarded for killing more of the survivors, although a single sacrifice is counted as a victory. Inevitably though, this scoring system leads to immersion-breaking actions like exploiting the killer's slow movement past obstacles, as survivors earn huge points by taunting their hunter.Another problem for Dead by Daylight is its matchmaking system. The game is entirely peer-to-peer hosted, with the killer hosting the survivors at all times. Unfortunately there's no way to tell where in the world the killer is or whether they're capable of hosting five people in a game until you're playing. There's no ping indicator and no regional matchmaking, so you have to roll the dice each time you join a new server--and if you crap out, you'll warp around the game world barely able to work out what's going on. Further, there's no group-based matchmaking, so you can't queue with friends. This results in players lobby-hopping until they are grouped with friends, which is a terrible experience for all involved."
1891,Diablo III,8.0,2," Diablo took place. This cosmic occurrence has the unfortunate side effect of reanimating the dead, and the people of New Tristram find themselves besieged by corpses long ago put to rest. Diablo III's story is unremarkable, but it weaves in plenty of references to and appearances by characters from earlier games and enriches the established lore of the series. Fans of Diablo and Diablo II will immediately feel drawn into this world. You certainly don't need any familiarity with the series to jump right into Diablo III, however. If you've played earlier games, you'll likely get even more out of Diablo III--the music that plays in the New Tristram area may send nostalgic shivers down your spine--but the gameplay is welcoming and easy to grasp for vets and newcomers alike. You choose one of five character classes, and though they become quite distinct at later levels, they all start with nothing but basic offensive skills. That may sound dull, but in fact the rate at which you acquire new skills is part of what makes Diablo III so hard to pull yourself away from. You very quickly open up slots for new types of abilities; if you're playing as a demon hunter, for instance, you begin with a basic archery attack, but you can soon supplement this with resource-draining skills like a rapid fire ability, enemy-slowing caltrops, acrobatic somersaults that can get you away from enemies, and other techniques. These skills are divided into distinct categories--primary, secondary, defensive, and so on--and by default, you can have only one skill from each category equipped at a time. This is a sensible restriction if you're a novice player, because it helps ensure that your character is well rounded, with a complementary assortment of abilities. However, if you prefer a greater level of character customization, you can turn on what's called elective mode. With this on, you can opt to equip whichever skills you want in your available slots, rather than being limited to choosing one from each category. But if you do this, be mindful of your character's resource pool. If you select two monk skills that cost spirit (the monk's resource) and no skills that generate spirit, you're going to have some trouble slaughtering the legions of hell spawn you encounter.   Choosing one skill always means not choosing another, since the number of buttons you can assign skills to is always equal to the number of active skill categories you've unlocked. (Once you've unlocked all six skill categories for your class, for instance, you have just six buttons to which you can link skills.) But you can change your selected skills at any time, giving you free rein to tinker with your abilities until you find a combination you're happy with. You never sink points into skills to make them more effective, so you never have to worry that you're not making the best choices. Rather, as you level up, you unlock both new skills and new runes you can apply to existing skills. From level 13 on, for instance, witch doctors can apply the numbing dart rune to their poison dart attack, which adds a slowing effect to this offensive ability. You can eventually unlock a total of six runes for each active ability, though you can have only one rune at a time activated on any ability. This system prevents you from squandering your character's growth by sinking points into skills that leave you ill-equipped for challenges to come, and lets you customize your abilities on the fly to better tackle the challenges you're currently facing. It's not all about unlocking skills, however. It's about employing those skills to slaughter the monsters you encounter as you travel the world, and collecting the loot the fiends drop. This is where Diablo III's habit-forming pleasures lie. The randomly generated environments encourage exploration; you never know what treasure (or what powerful foe) you might find down each cathedral hallway or desert trail. Enticing art design draws you into these realms. In and around New Tristram, a foreboding mist hangs in the air, and ancient ruins crumble as you visit places long undisturbed. In the lands around the elegant city of Caldeum, you traverse stark landscapes of cracked earth and bone.   The Lord of the Rings is a bit obvious, a setting in the game's fourth act effectively makes you feel like part of a desperate, large-scale war between humanity and the forces of hell. Just when you've had your fill of one region, it's time to move on to another, and each location is so different from the one that preceded it that you feel as if your quest to rid the land of evil is taking you across a vast and varied realm. As diverse as these locations are, they all have one thing in common: they're crawling with monsters. In the early stages of your quest, on normal difficulty, most monsters fall to your attacks without putting up much of a fight, though if you get swarmed, you might still need to keep an eye on your health. (Unlike in Diablo II, you can't spam health potions to immediately counter any damage you suffer; potions have a cooldown timer, requiring you to play a bit more cautiously.) Your attacks look mighty and effective, which makes the simple act of unleashing them feel empowering. The demon hunter's huge chakrams weave through the air, blades spinning; the barbarian's hard-hitting strikes can send foes flying. Without fail, you're rewarded for mowing down monsters with gold and gear. This is typical of the series and the genre, but it's handled here as well as it's ever been. You never feel like you're being showered with riches and items you haven't earned, nor that you're having to slog through too many foes to earn anything significant. Loot is doled out at a pace that makes your victories fulfilling and makes fighting the next group of foes lurking in the shadows ahead nigh irresistible.   The way your rewards emerge into the world is rewarding in itself; slay an elite monster, and coins and items pour onto the ground, making you feel like you've just won a jackpot in Vegas. Sometimes, the gear is junk so low in value that it's not even worth picking up. But you never know when you're going to stumble on a weapon or piece of armor that's superior to your current equipment, making you more capable of facing the coming hordes. Even if something isn't worth using, it's often worth grabbing, either to sell or to have it salvaged by the blacksmith in town for materials that can be used to craft other items. Weapons function in Diablo III a bit oddly, though, and that may take some getting used to. Often, you may elect to have your primary skill be something that isn't weapon-based. You may choose the demon hunter's grenade attack, for instance, or the wizard's magic missile spell. Although these skills don't involve your characters actually using whatever weapons they're holding in their hands, the damage of your equipped weapon still comes into play. In other words, all other things being equal, a wizard's magic missile spell does more damage if she's holding a club that does 12 damage than if she's holding a dagger that does 10 damage. It's a system that makes more gear useful to more classes, but that usefulness comes at the expense of typical fantasy RPG logic. If you haven't yet found the perfect helm, boots, or crossbow for your character, you may opt to have the blacksmith craft you items. As with the stuff you find in the wild, the magic properties on gear he crafts are random, so there's often no guarantee that something he creates for you will suit you better than your current equipment, but odds are that sometimes he'll craft something that's ideal for you.   Unfortunately, you need to spend a good deal of gold on training him to level him up so that he can craft higher-level gear for you, and early on, it can feel as if you're sinking all your gold into this and reaping little reward. The rewards do come eventually, though, and all your characters in a given mode share the same craftsmen (the blacksmith and, later, a jeweler), so once the money is spent on training, you don't need to worry about spending it again. The cycle of combat and loot and more combat is addictive, but without peril, it would eventually become unfulfilling. Thankfully, the hosts of hell become increasingly dangerous over time. Boss fights are numerous and frequent, and those that bring each act to a close can be challenging. They also offer more traditional action-game mechanics than the series has seen before. An early boss charges into walls, for example, leaving him stunned and giving you a chance to attack safely. After you complete the game on the normal difficulty setting, you can continue on to nightmare, which is much more than just playing the same game again against more resilient foes. Nightmare changes things up by giving enemies powerful new abilities and placing challenging enemies in places where they didn't previously appear. Conquer nightmare, and yet another, even more challenging difficulty becomes available. And new to the console versions, there are sub-difficulty options, allowing you to play normal difficulty on easy, for instance, or nightmare difficulty on hard. Whether you want a relatively easy, rewarding experience that you can pleasantly click your way through or an incredibly stiff challenge, Diablo III has what you're looking for. And for that added element of risk, you can play in Hardcore mode, where death is permanent. Each class has the offensive capabilities to take on the forces of darkness alone, and the three AI companions you can choose from offer a helping hand and a sense of camaraderie to solo adventurers. But joining with up to three other players makes for a far more interesting dynamic. Freezing enemies in place when you're playing solo as a wizard is useful, but when doing so aids a team of players who are working together, it's much more fulfilling. Similarly, activating a mantra of healing as a monk just when your party is in dire need of a health boost is far more rewarding than just using this ability to save yourself.   Players can cooperate either locally or online, but while both options are enjoyable, local co-op is quite restrictive, and the interface slows things down. All players must stay on the same screen, and whenever a player accesses his or her inventory, skills, or some other menu, it takes up the whole screen, leaving other players with nothing to do but wait until he or she is done. Other console dungeon crawlers, dating back at least as far as Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, have split up the screen so that multiple players can manage their inventories simultaneously, and the lack of such considerations here makes the local co-op option feel tacked on. Nonetheless, in local and particularly online co-op, combat is significantly different and a great deal more fun. On console as on PC, Diablo III is a very safe game. It never diverges from the path carved by its predecessors and the numerous loot-driven hack-and-slash dungeon crawlers they inspired. But Diablo III also proves that when done well, the classic formula can still be absorbing. The powerful abilities of the diverse character classes are fun to use, the world is varied and enticing, and the constant promise of more riches and better gear makes conquering that next group of foes an alluring prospect indeed. Don't take up arms against Diablo because you care about saving the world. Do it for fortune and glory."
4253,Shadow Madness,4.0,0,"It's difficult to find a game genre these days that isn't inhabited with both Japanese- and American-developed games. For whatever reason, however, the console RPG has been a Japanese mainstay for as long as many can remember - most US-developed console RPGs were simply PC ports or adaptations, not original content. Let it be said that Craveyard isn't the US's best ambassador in the realm of RPG development, and let's hope it isn't the last. Considering how long this game was in development, one would have hoped that Craveyard would have come up with something better than this. Welcome to the land of Arkose, a typically fantastic RPG world that's recently been plagued by self-destructing cities, a mind-scrambling disease, and a variety of other social maladies. Narrowly avoiding death in the blast that destroyed his hometown, the roguish good-guy Stinger seeks revenge against the mysterious force that tore his life to shreds. On his journey, Stinger meets Windleaf - a waifish elfin girl with mystical powers, and Harv-5 - a literally barrel-chested farm robot. Shadow Madness' story is fairly dark, although it has its fair share of humorous dialog and situations. The long, two CD-spanning adventure's story develops nicely, even if it is a little cliche or contrived at times. Due to the fact that it was written for American audiences, Shadow Madness' text is of generally high quality and blends humor and drama with a mostly favorable effect. Supplementing the nice text is an abundance of Arkosian historical texts, simply available should players want to know more about the land they're saving. Chances are they won't, however, as getting to the story is a chore - Shadow Madness is a boring, poorly executed game, filled with an abundance of just plain stupid design flaws. The game's general look and feel are remarkably similar to that of the recent Final Fantasy games, sporting polygonal characters roaming around prerendered backdrops. Battles occur, as in many console RPGs, randomly. The key to any console RPG is a competent battle engine and interface, and Shadow Madness generally lacks both. Battles are built around a poorly conceived menu system that requires you to sort through four submenus with the left and right shoulder buttons. While this can speed access menu navigation with practice, it never becomes truly intuitive. As Shadow Madness mimics Final Fantasy's active battle system, the thinking behind this implementation is understood, but the execution ultimately fails. While boss battles are a different story, battles generally boil down to simply attacking monsters until they're dead, with little emphasis on the use of magic or other strategic devices. Random encounters generally require little strategy and take just a little too long to be tolerable. Fortunately, many random encounters can be avoided before they begin, but overusing this innovative feature can be detrimental to your long-term health and result in wasted hours of supplementary character building. Many of the game's other problems stem from an annoying lack of design economy, resulting in a game that can be summed up as sloppy. Arkose is a world littered with innumerable useless items - for every useful item you find, you'll likely find five completely worthless ones that you'll quickly discarded to make room for other useful items in the annoyingly small backpack. Inventory management like this is a complete waste of the your time, and Shadow Madness is rife with it. When you go up levels, spells are generally handed out in groups of three, resulting in an extremely long list of spells in a small battle window, wasting valuable time in the pseudo-real-time battles. To top it off, a majority of these spells have almost meaningless names and only slightly varied effects when cast. Innovations such as double-damage with a carefully timed button press. Avoiding random encounters are nice to see in Shadow Madness, but this hardly begin to make up for the game's problems.Whoever said ""Graphics don't matter"" never played Shadow Madness. Shadow Madness is truly hideous to behold in its own right - even worse when compared with the RPG masterpieces it seeks to emulate. To start, the game features the most heinous character art in an RPG. Stinger is a, er... ""colorful"" caricature of FF7's Cloud, sporting a natty ponytail, a cute little red vest and a big sword. Harv-5 is a barrel adorned with a tin cappuccino cup, googly eyes, and a straw hat. And Windleaf... well, she just has to be seen to be believed. Other character designs include an old man's head atop a floating dinner plate, and a fat woman with cheesy cyberpunk-like sunglasses. As if their core concepts weren't terrible enough, Shadow Madness' artists spared just about all efforts to bring them to life. Monsters and characters alike are decidedly low on polygons, textures, and animation. If the frame rate were decent, this kind of problem could be overlooked - maybe. The spell ""effects"" generally consist of expanding spheres with different textures, or sloppily rendered FMV summon sequences that look far less impressive than the real-time summon spells of Final Fantasy VII. Attempting to stray from the current trend of polygonal world maps, Shadow Madness instead uses a truly bleak, crayon-drawn series of 2D maps with no detail or visual appeal whatsoever. In what could have been a nice touch, Craveyard added character portraits to all dialog boxes - unfortunately, the crude, cartoonish nature of the portraits is as bad as the rest of the game's art and takes any impact from the accompanying text. The rendered backgrounds range from extremely drab to average, doing nothing to improve the overwhelmingly terrible visual experience that is Shadow Madness. To re-create an eyesore of this caliber would truly take effort. Surprisingly enough, amidst all of this, Shadow Madness somehow manages to pull an above-average musical score. Sporting a large variety of tunes for every situation, the music subtly and attractively evokes the game's darker nature and avoids the over-the-top orchestrations most RPGs tend to employ. Shadow Madness is a decent story shrouded by years of bad decisions. As painful as it is to say so, seeing Craveyard disband after threats of a Shadow Madness sequel almost seems like a good thing. Shadow Madness is a curiosity and a cautionary tale of development for the ages, and should remain little more than that."
2606,Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion,8.0,2,"  Sins of a Solar Empire reaches new heights with the stand-alone expansion Rebellion, which is the best way yet to play this 4X space real-time strategy game. Developer Ironclad Games hasn't reinvented the wheel, choosing to tweak the four-year-old franchise's fundamentals instead of tearing things up. This results in an ingeniously refined new experience that leans on a number of adjustments and additions to features like victory conditions, ship classes, and even the graphical engine. All of this fine-tuning of the feature set doesn't quite warrant the $40 price tag (although owners of the previous games in the series can qualify for a $10 break), but for that cash outlay you get a greatly modified version of a classic RTS game that will keep you forging galactic empires for many hours.                      New victory options also add variety to matches. Where before you had to win through domination (basically obliterating all rivals) or through diplomacy, now your empire can soar to success based on numerous objectives. These conditions further break up late-game stalemates and give players with different tactical preferences the ability to win games without leaving their comfort zones. For instance, the less aggressive can go after diplomatic or tech victories. Warriors can now win without destroying everything in sight, courtesy of new victory conditions that give wins to the faction that annihilates enemy capital planets, occupies a hidden world guarded by a neutral AI fleet, or takes out powerhouse enemy flagships.           "
3771,Puzzlegeddon,5.0,1,"  The Book of Revelations may have foretold the end of the world, but it failed to mention that the Earth's ultimate destruction would come by way of benign-looking puzzle pieces. Puzzlegeddon brings to life the mythical fire and brimstone in a competitive puzzle game that urges players to forcibly attack their opponents by chaining together strings of high-scoring combos. It's a concept pulled straight from the popular Puzzle Quest, but Puzzlegeddon feels painfully shallow compared to its hugely successful forbearer. Whether you play against computer-controlled bots or able-minded humans, you're confined to a series of one-off matches. There is neither a story mode to play through nor character statistics to build and form through time. Thus, you are left with a serviceable though forgettable experience that is moderately fun in five-minute bursts but lacks any incentive to come back for another round.        Colored blocks must strictly adhere to their destiny. By coming into contact with their like-colored brothers, they disappear in a puff of smoke, banished from view forever. In Puzzlegeddon, you slide these blocks along a 6-by-6 square to form a match of five of the same color, and when you achieve that goal, you tap a button to make them vanish. By creating chains and combos, you also improve your score exponentially. The core mechanics work well. By allowing you to decide when you want to initiate a combo--instead of the game automatically making blocks disappear as soon as they touch--you can carefully build big combos that would simply not be possible in other games. However, sliding blocks quickly becomes dull because the game has so little variety. There are only four different colors to worry about, and there aren't any wild-card blocks or other tricks to throw a wrench in your combo making. It makes for a predictable experience that quickly becomes old.     The purpose of all this block chaining is to build up meters that allow you to strike down your opponents. Depending on what color blocks you dispose of, you put points into one of four different abilities: attack, disrupt, defense, and boost. Each of these abilities has three different levels, giving you access to more powerful maneuvers if you have enough patience to bide your time. For instance, the lowest attack level gives you just one weak missile to launch at an opponent; the second level splits that one missile into three deadly bombs; and the fully powered level lets you unleash one giant missile. One strange aspect is that you cannot choose which level attack you unleash. If you have your attack meter completely full, you have to send out your huge missile. Letting you decide if you want to drop the big one or three small missiles instead would have given the game more flexibility. This ultimately limits the strategic element, making it much easier to predict what your opponents will do.     Even against a group of up to 5 human foes (online only), matches lack the explosive appeal you might imagine accompanying a puzzle-themed take on Armageddon. Defense and attack are far more important than boost and disrupt, which means you have to make a concerted effort to match green and red colored blocks to keep those meters perpetually full. As long as you have your defensive meter maxed out, you make it extremely difficult to get attacked because you can repel any missile that comes your way. This powerful maneuver gives you immunity against even the most deadly missiles. Because it is so effective in waylaying any threat, the balance of matches is heavily slanted in favor of forming green chains, making an already predictable game even less exciting. After three or four matches, you'll have seen every combination of attack and defense possible, giving you little reason to go back for more end-of-the-world puzzle action.        Aside from the standard battle matches, there is only one other mode in which to compete. Poison Peril swaps out the brightly colored blocks for ones adorned with a skull, casket, and other gothic imagery. You no longer have opponents or colored meters to worry about either. Instead, you have a specific objective you must complete, such as forming a certain number of chains or disposing of every block with a bat on it. In this mode, you have to deal with evil blocks as well. If you form a chain with a poisoned block nearby, you damage yourself. You can only take so many hits before your game is finished, which creates a feeling of tension as you carefully weigh all your options. Poison Peril is more interesting than the standard matches, but it too has limited appeal. Your total score is based on how many levels you pass, but you must start at ground zero every time. There is no way to begin during the later stages, which is when things become more challenging, and the easy early levels aren't much fun to replay.      Puzzlegeddon is far too simple to hold the attention of puzzle aficionados for very long. With only four different colors to manage, the puzzle-sliding aspects are too easy and give players little challenge in their quest to form like-colored matches. The battle elements are way too predictable, limiting players strategies to such a strong extent that every match blends together with all your previous trials. Without any story mode to speak of or even a hint of persistent game mechanics, Puzzlegeddon is too shallow to make more than a mild splash on the puzzle landscape.   "
3313,The Ball,6.0,1,"Portal captured our hearts with mind-bending gameplay and one snarky AI. Now, The Ball from Teotl Studios aims to rekindle what made the Portal experience so memorable by putting a spin on physics-based puzzling. But while it's packed with clever challenges, nasty enemies, and a unique Aztec design, many of the game's finer moments are buried beneath so many layers of tedium that you might never reach them.      Unreal Tournament III mod, The Ball earned second place in the ""Make Something Unreal"" competition by Epic Games before being picked up by publisher Tripwire Interactive. Set in 1940's Mexico, the game drops you into an expedition gone awry deep within a volcanic mountain. You're left with no other option but to plunge into the abyss. Not long into your descent, you stumble upon a handheld Aztec cannon and the ball: a massive, metallic sphere that is both a silent friend and the key to your escape.      Using your handy cannon, you can easily manipulate the ball by either hammering it away from you or drawing it magnetically towards you. Together, you and the ball roll through a lost subterranean civilization riddled with puzzles; puzzles that start out easy and stay that way until you hit the credits. The majority of these mental exercises involve either standing on a switch, pushing the ball into a switch, or standing on a switch while guiding the ball to another switch. Naturally, this starts to feel very repetitive very quickly. With such slim variety up front, there's little motivating you to stick with The Ball through the early stages.      For the truly dedicated, however, patience is rewarded in the game's final acts. Challenges evolve from simple switches to ones that, for instance, have the ball adopting special properties. In one area, the ball projects a low-gravity field that allows for some impressive vertical movement. Another has you painting the floor with oil before lighting up a trail of fire. Why these clever ideas are hidden away so far into the game is a mystery. Such creativity would have better served the game up front.     Unlike the puzzles, combat in The Ball is starved for variety throughout. Your simpleminded foes come primarily in one of two flavors: bum rush or projectile. When you spot a pack of them barreling your way--mouths agape and eyes hungry for murder--you simply slide your rolling sphere of death in their direction and pop them like ripe tomatos (complete with screen-splattering gore). While simple and satisfying at first, the carnage quickly loses its luster after your first dozen encounters. Some tougher, late-game brutes (that you can't simply roll into oblivion) provide the only legitimately interesting challenge by forcing you to use both the ball and the environment to defeat them.        But though The Ball suffers from lack of substance, it benefits from a great sense of style. The presentation of its lost Aztec metropolis feels unique throughout as it guides you down a labyrinth of ancient ruins, emerald lakes, and molten seas of magma. It's a pity the story didn't receive this level of attention. Largely throwaway, the key plot elements are handled via static exposition at fixed intervals. Other nuggets of detail are also hidden away in the form of secret items within each stage.   Serious Sam. Without a fulfilling combat system to support it, Survival mode doesn't hold up past initial curiosity and serves only as a bullet point on the game's feature list.     Where Portal excelled in trimming away filler to provide an extremely focused gaming experience, The Ball stops frustratingly short of the mark. With a disheartening lack of variety plaguing the first two-thirds of the game, it's an unnecessarily laborious task to unearth its finer moments. As an Unreal Tournament mod, The Ball is certainly one of the finest. As a retail product, however, poor pacing keeps it from stacking up against the competition.  "
4193,Combat Mission: Shock Force,4.0,0,"  Back when the Combat Mission series began in 2000, it was a revelation. The Battlefront wargame set during World War II was authentic and unflinching enough to earn the grognard's seal of approval, yet also so downright approachable that it didn't scare off newbies looking for something a little more realistic than the run-of-the-mill RTS. Sequels have only built on this greatness, too, which means that expectations rise awfully high whenever a new addition to the family comes along.     So it's hard not to feel let down by Combat Mission: Shock Force. This is more of a members-only wargame, with an unforgiving interface and so many intricacies that even those familiar with the earlier games in the series will find themselves lost over and over again during the first few hours of play. Even worse, there isn't much here to reward diehards who struggle through the grueling early going. Artificial intelligence is largely missing in action, scenarios feel gimmicky and prearranged, and just about everything seems rough and unfinished. Battlefront has already shown its willingness to improve the game, having released a version 1.01 patch on the day of the game's online launch that addresses some issues, but a tremendous amount of work remains.     At least Battlefront started with a good idea. Instead of going back for yet another visit to Adolf and Uncle Joe, CM: Shock Force moves the setting to a near-future battleground in the Middle East. Instead of creeping through French hedgerows or rolling Panzers over farm fields, the campaign, one-off battles, and multiplayer engagements are based on the notion of the US invading Syria in 2009 to topple its leaders. The background story and war depicted here is really a straight copy of what happened with 9/11 and Afghanistan, although you've still got to give Battlefront points for trying.        Not that the story and setting really matter much in the end. It's tough to get deep enough into the game to appreciate what's going on in the Syrian sands, particularly if you've never played the previous Combat Missions. Battlefront has added a training campaign to the game with the 1.01 patch (the launch game had no tutorial whatsoever, so you had to rely on fumbling your way through small-scale missions like Al Huqf Engagement to figure out what was going on), although it isn't nearly comprehensive enough to address the many ins and outs of modern combat presented here. The manual doesn't help a great deal, either. While lots of information is stuffed into its 200-plus pages, this PDF tome is laid out like reference material geared solely to answer specific questions. And this is one game that needs a manual to take you by the hand. The interface is jammed with text that's about the same size as the fine print on auto-rental contracts, along with numerous tiny buttons bereft of context or tool tips. Hotkeys are supported, but you can't change them without editing a text file in Windows, and they annoyingly change function depending on what you're doing at the time you hit them. When you move, for example, the ""I"" key is ""Quick,"" but when you're in combat ""I"" stands for ""Target Light."" Good idea, guys. Everything is so clunky and archaic, it's amazing that Battlefront doesn't include a code wheel for look-up copy protection.     Gameplay itself doesn't feel quite right, either. Battlefront has attempted to revamp the combat engine with the option to play in real time, in addition to the familiar turn-based WeGo system from the earlier games in the series. This new feature is very hard to appreciate, however, due to some big glitches. Pathfinding is absolutely awful, albeit improved in the 1.01 patch from the horror show on display in the original build. Soldiers still run into one another constantly and take the long way around buildings. Vehicles slam into each other and swivel in place. Even something really simple, like ordering a bunch of Stryker combat vehicles to move straight ahead, results in a panicky fire drill when they're in close quarters, with the trucks driving every which way but the one you selected. Similar problems are apparent when playing with WeGo, although it's easier to adjust to them by using lots of waypoints.     Enemy AI is just as hit-and-miss as the pathfinding. Again, it's better with the 1.01 patch than it was in the original release (sensing a trend here?), but foes still often hold their positions and fire back only after you've initiated an attack. Even in missions where you're supposed to be competing for an objective, AI troops will sometimes mindlessly hang back and wait for you to move in and slaughter them. It's almost as if units have little, if any, functioning AI and are responding solely to battlefield triggers.        And this isn't the only reason that CM: Shock Force combat lacks authenticity. Although the battles here are all about modern asymmetrical warfare such as that currently being waged in Iraq between the US and ragtag local insurgents, the game is still very much a creature of the Second World War. All Battlefront has really done is shoehorn its old approach into very different theater of war where the sides are wildly lopsided, not fairly even like it was in many WW II engagements. Syria's military isn't anywhere near that of a superpower right now, so there's a real credibility gap in having them match up so evenly with US forces.     Also, the gimmick of unconventional forces is used to balance the two sides on occasion. Basically this means that thugs in civvies pop out from the civilian population every now and again to say hello with rocket launchers. This is a great idea that seems pulled from the daily headlines coming out of Iraq. But it's executed terribly, as civilian populations aren't depicted in the game. Unconventional enemies are invisible to the Yanks until they either flat-out attack or come so close to units that they apparently become suspicious enough to warrant a closer look. Of course, all you actually see are goons materializing out of nowhere with IEDs at the ready, which makes the whole concept seem like an AI cheat.     Criticisms can also be leveled at the graphics and sound. While nobody expects boutique wargames to be gorgeous, CM: Shock Force is downright hideous. Battle landscapes are grainy and seem to float on top of a backdrop. Every map is dominated by desert terrain, even though the real Syria is actually quite geographically diverse. Weird artifacts clutter up the landscape and flashes regularly make parts of the terrain twinkle and vanish like some Arabian Brigadoon. Yet even though the game was thoroughly clubbed with the ugly stick, it remains a system hog. Technical problems constantly interfere with gameplay, especially in the real-time mode. Constant hitches when zooming in and out and odd delays when rotating the camera angle mean that you regularly have to pause to give orders. Audio seems almost random. Syrians speak in a repetitive, muddled Arabic that sounds like they're saying ""Yella!"" (""Come on!"") over and over again. Granted, you do hear this a lot in the Middle East as the word is casually used like ""Hey!"" is in the US, but here it's said so much that it sounds like the speakers are stuttering. Weapon effects are better, at least, as are the comments from US troops, which seem pretty well-suited to specific combat situations.     What more can be said? CM: Shock Force is a tremendous disappointment. There is still a great deal of promise here, Battlefront has already started whipping the game into shape through what will no doubt be a long succession of patches, and the diehard fan base will undoubtedly use the included editor to make some impressive battles. Even so, no game should be released in such a rough, incomplete state.    "
3978,America,5.0,1," 	America is a Wild West-themed real-time strategy game from German developer Data Becker. Although the setting of the game is distinctive, and some of the specific mechanics of play are fairly interesting, there is actually very little in America that isn't taken straight from other older, better real-time strategy games. More specifically, America is a plainly obvious attempt at borrowing the successful elements of the popular historical-themed game Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings. Unfortunately for America, its attempts to replicate the graphics, sound, gameplay, and balance of Ensemble Studios' excellent strategy game simply don't add up.  America isn't much of a history lesson. It lets you play as four different factions: settlers, outlaws, Mexicans, and Native Americans. As in any typical 2D real-time strategy game, each of these factions has some superficial and strategic differences and otherwise a lot in common. The game follows the exact same pattern that's typical of the genre: You must use your workers to build a resource-gathering infrastructure, gather a sufficient amount of these resources while expanding your territory, and then build up a force of armed troops with whom you eliminate the opposition. The pacing of the game is slow in the extensive resource-gathering phase and often much too fast once combat ensues. Generally, the battles are won by whoever manages to bring along the most troops.   It's easy to compare America with Age of Empires II because America initially looks so much like Ensemble's game. The isometric perspective, the earthy color scheme, and the tiny units are all very similar. However, America's graphics lack a lot of the detail and polish of those in Age of Empires II--the various units and structures can be very difficult to distinguish from one another. Yet while America doesn't look very interesting, it doesn't really look bad--but it certainly sounds bad. Each unit in the game has its own grating, repetitive catchphrase. These are often predictable and silly--the cowboys all say, ""Hold your horses, man!"" Also, in the single-player campaign, each mission opens with a long-winded spoken monologue that's delivered in what's meant to be that particular faction's dialect. The accents are so badly affected that it becomes impossible to take the game seriously. As in Age of Empires II, the game's soundtrack relies heavily on percussion and woodwind instruments, and as such it isn't nearly as bad as the speech.   The game offers a four-mission tutorial, plus four fairly short but generally very difficult single-player campaigns for each of the four respective sides. There's a skirmish mode, a multiplayer mode, and a fair number of maps to choose from for these. You can toggle the difficulty level of the computer opponent, which explicitly seems to determine how aggressively the computer will build up its forces. America even has a few extra frills, including prerendered cinematic sequences in the campaigns. During the game, you have some convenient gameplay options that are lifted straight out of Age of Empires II, such as the ability to queue production of units and research, to highlight idle worker units, and to set formations. Of course, these options are only noteworthy because they're typically omitted in most second-rate real-time strategy games.  Some of the gameplay elements in America are promising. You can produce livestock for food and money as well as horses for your troops and for your wagon transports. Your units have morale (which simply affects their combat skills) and can become stronger as they gain experience in battle. Some of your units can mount horses at will, which typically makes them more effective in battle. If your units are killed anyway, enemy forces may steal their mounts for their own. The game's main resources include food, wood, gold, and guns. The first three are gathered like in Age of Empires II--basically you get them out in the wilderness--while guns must be manufactured, bought, or stolen. The settlers and the Mexicans later gain access to cannons. Native American warriors can swim. The outlaws excel at thievery and also produce food in a most unorthodox fashion: at distilleries. As the manual points out, ""these tough guys live primarily on liquor."" This may be funny, but it doesn't say much in favor of the game's attempts at real-world authenticity.   Otherwise, there's really not much else to say in favor of any particular aspect of the game. It has some technical problems and doesn't run smoothly on midrange systems. The campaign missions do have changing objectives, but they're typically very straightforward and will be overwhelming for inexperienced players. The multiplayer mode isn't much fun; there isn't a lot of variety and you always have to start from the ground up. The game's graphics are uninspired and the sound is awful, and those elements in the gameplay that are subtly different from those in other real-time strategy games won't be noticeable to any but the most experienced real-time strategy players. But regardless of how much experience you have with games of this type, you'll probably be disappointed with America. It's too hard to play if you're relatively new to the genre, either because the missions themselves are too tough or because all the graphics are too similar. On the other hand, if you've already played and enjoyed similar games, then you'll find that America offers very little to draw your attention away from any of these.      	  "
242,Total War: WARHAMMER III,6.0,1,"Large-scale strategy games tend to struggle with their endgames. Boiling down decisions made over hundreds of turns into a satisfying win-state is no simple task. Victory conditions often feel arbitrary, even disconnected--as if the competing factions are not merely pursuing different strategies, but playing different games. Even if that's not the case, winning a game typically happens hours before the game recognizes it, and the rest is just a matter of slogging your way to the inevitable conclusion. Total War: Warhammer 3 is no exception. It may be the series' most spectacular, varied, and tactically rich entry yet, but its endgame problems reverberate throughout the whole campaign, undermining a strategic layer that deserves better.Warhammer 3 makes an excellent first impression. The prologue is a mini-campaign that feels almost like an RPG in the way it zooms in on one major character and offers a strong throughline as you gradually explore the map. Short cinematic scenes present your army's strategic decisions in ways that lend narrative purpose to the choices you make. Ultimately, it serves as a terrific introduction to the game's basic mechanics, while also drawing you into its world. After all that scene-setting, however, much of that flavor and the character-driven goals are lost.Developer Creative Assembly has rethought the series' traditional approach to winning a Total War campaign in deeply unsatisfying fashion. Painting the map--the common euphemism for how conquering territories changes them to your faction's color--isn't the end goal here, although it may still inform the journey. Instead, no matter which faction you choose to play, your objective is to send an army into the Chaos Realm, a dimension of pure magic in Warhammer lore represented here as a discrete section of the map, and secure a set of MacGuffins. Collect all four and you unlock the final battle. You're still marching armies around a great big map, besieging towns and capturing provinces, as you would in any other Total War, but your success in the campaign is measured only through how quickly you can collect those MacGuffins.The structural issue here is that the two aspects of the campaign--the regular campaign map and the brief excursions into the Chaos Realm--don't really talk to each other or interact in any particularly interesting ways. In fact, because the latter assumes primacy (since it is the way to win the game), much of what you do on the regular map feels redundant. Conquering neighboring towns, cutting deals with your allies, and building up your infrastructure is as enjoyable as it has ever been, but it often feels disconnected from your primary goal of gearing up one army lead by one lord on its excursions into the Chaos Realm.Every few dozen turns, portals open up on the map that connect to the Chaos Realm. You can send an army through a portal--just the one army, and it has to be led by your faction leader lord--and enter one of the four Chaos Realm locations, each of which underwhelms with a slight gimmick as to how it is completed. One is an annoying maze of linked portals where you end up playing an awkward game of Concentration to work out which portals take you where. Another is a series of gates, each offering a nice piece of gear in exchange for exiting the realm and not doing what you went there to do. It's meant to be a temptation--an offer you can't refuse--but all it really reveals is that accepting the gift is a waste of time.There are battles to fight here, of course, and they're as good in the Chaos Realm as elsewhere. Few strategy games rival Total War for large-scale spectacle, and Warhammer 3's battles benefit from the over-the-top nature of its fantasy where demons fly above improbably jagged terrain while fire and ice flood the field as you send your ravenous war beasts to outflank the enemy's poison-spewing serpents. But outside of a handful of battles, the Chaos Realm offers nothing you'll want to participate in after you've seen it once--and even that initial encounter will leave you wondering, ""Is that it?"" The problem is further compounded by how the realms are the same every time you play, and completing them is compulsory.By separating the Chaos Realm from the regular campaign map, and by only allowing one army to enter it, you end up prioritizing one big, well-stocked army commanded by your faction leader over all your other forces. This is the solitary war machine that's going to win you the game and, well, maybe you've got a few other lesser lords leading some sort of ragtag divisions that you probably don't need to worry about much. It's true that the portals to the Chaos Realm shake up regular gameplay by letting Chaos armies through to raid and pillage your territories, but you can easily send a lord or hero to close them at a fairly trivial cost. And you will need some sort of standing army in place to defend your homeland should another faction choose to invade while your main army is off tracking down the next MacGuffin. But once you have that primary army up and running and are able to recruit all the most powerful military units, there's little incentive to continue expanding your territory. Indeed, counter to Total War tradition, I found it advantageous to simply turtle up and wait for the next opportunity to visit the Chaos Realm. Less territory meant fewer portals to close, which meant fewer unexpected guests running loose, and fewer positions I needed to defend. I focused all my attention on that one army and that was enough.That is, it was enough to win the campaign. But not enough to make the experience anything more than a perfunctory, and even boring, slog. This is a shame, because Total War: Warhammer 3 actually offers a lot of strategic depth and some welcome additions that make for a much more enjoyable experience if you're not trying to achieve the campaign objectives at all costs.For a start, all the factions feel incredibly different. From the fixed starting positions of each one and their broader abilities that affect how they employ strategies on the campaign map, to the unique makeup of their armies and individual lords and heroes, there's considerable incentive to replay the campaign as each of the eight factions--and presumably more to come with post-launch support. They're also loaded with personality in a way that somehow manages to be outrageously campy while taking itself incredibly seriously. ""The bondage will be legendary!"" bellowed one of my lords, the perfectly chef's kiss-named Soulscreamer Witherslash, every time I ordered them to do something. I'm not a Warhammer obsessive in the slightest, so it all comes across as impossibly silly. But when you recruit a demon hero with the name E'ddi'e, you can't help but get on board with the ridiculousness of it all.Elsewhere, there are some excellent additions to an already very solid strategic base. Diplomacy is greatly improved through new features that let you see at a glance which of the hundred or so factions are interested in trading resources or forming an alliance. The ability to construct outposts in allied settlements, and then recruit their unique units to your army, provides even more flexibility to the composition of your forces and allows you to further refine specific tactics in battle. Sieges have been tweaked to embellish strategic considerations with every turn you spend hoping to wait out the enemy or strike before reinforcements arrive. Even the terrain itself comes into play, as the native winds of magic blow favor one way or another while Chaos itself can creep across the lands if left unchecked. These and a host of other minor tweaks combine to deliver a campaign map that is--endgame objectives aside--the best the series has been.Overall, the battles don't feel terribly different to what we've seen in recent Total War games--which is not intended as a criticism. There's enough variety to units and heroes, each bringing a range of abilities, that discovering the best tactical approaches takes time and plenty of experimentation, adding opportunities to strategize and see your efforts pay off in fulfilling ways. Of the new battle features, I particularly liked the implementation of deployable structures like barricades and towers during settlement battles. When combined with the neat layouts of these maps, with a healthy eye towards varying terrain heights, the new structures make settlements a lot of fun to defend and quite the challenge to attack. Generally speaking, though, when it comes to Warhammer 3's tactical battles, it's very much a case of if it ain't broke, don't fix it.Warhammer 3 opens strongly. The narrative hook of the prologue sinks deep and the raft of tweaks to the strategic layer and tactical battles are all welcome. But it can't sustain the early momentum. The endgame objectives feel like a distraction, even though they're the main point, and serve only to diminish the entire campaign. The factions all have different reasons for wanting the endgame MacGuffin, but none of those motivations make a difference to how the campaign plays out. They're all trapped in the same Chaos Realm, going through the same motions, in pursuit of the same unsatisfying win conditions. In the end, Total War: Warhammer 3 is a good game--there just isn't a good reason to see it through to the bitter end."
1752,Lost Constellation,8.0,2," Lost Constellation's great accomplishment is that it captures the improvisatory spirit of the bard and the jester. Characters in games don't often speak like people actually speak--they speak like writers write. In this ephemeral 2D adventure, the characters aren't people; they are cats and mice, snowmen and alligators. Yet they speak as if they are individuals unto themselves, rather than exposition machines. What they say might baffle you: ""I'm not following this line of logic,"" exclaims the game's heroine to a mouse that serves as the gatekeeper of a mysterious totem. Later, the young cat that stands in as the game's audience asks the narrator--her grandfather--what this story is about. ""What do you want it to be about?"" he responds. Whether or not you find that reply helpful or unhelpful depends on how important it is to you that a tale provides all the answers and dutifully states its meaning.     Night in the Woods, a more expansive game set in the same universe. The game's clearest and most human sentiment accompanies that finale, at which point it muses on how we seek connections to the things we least understand--a suitable conviction for a story with such free-associative ideas and dreamlike tangents. To play Lost Constellation is to wrap yourself in a fleece blanket and shelter yourself from the cold."
1177,Loot Rascals,5.0,1,"The opening cutscene of Loot Rascals, largely narrated by a teapot-headed British spaceman, establishes the game’s strange tone well. Instead of arriving at a holiday-resort planet to restore a medical unit's antenna as intended, you crash on an alien moon and find yourself battling against the game’s eponymous “rascals” that have stolen the medical unit. To get it back, you’ll need to trek through five randomly generated levels, battling or avoiding the moon’s many aggressors.Loot Rascals is wacky in a way that feels genuine; the art style and creature design in particular feel like the work of artists who watched a lot of The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show as kids and soaked up its playful grotesquery.The action in Loot Rascals unfolds in a turn-based fashion. You move between hexagonal spaces, uncovering each area as you go, and either fight or circumvent enemies you encounter. Your goal is to find the warp spaces in each zone and make it to the fifth level to escape. Your attack and defense ratings are determined by the cards you’ve collected from defeated enemies. Meanwhile, enemies toggle between attack and defense modes on a day-night cycle that sees the sun or moon rise every five turns. Battles are automatically triggered when you and an enemy are on the same space. You want to attack foes while they’re defending because you’ll score the first hit--and, if your attack rating is high enough, you’ll be able to take them out before they get their chance to counterattack.It’s a solid core system, especially if you manage to get your hands on some strong cards early on. Several have different mutations that can strengthen your stats or grant new abilities. You can equip eight cards at once and hold six others, and where you place them in your “hand” matters--a card may power up all others to its right, for example, or lose all power if placed in the top row. Balancing your cards and figuring out the best combinations based on what you have is one of the game’s more rewarding elements.Loot Rascals’ core problem is repetition. This is, admittedly, a core part of the roguelike experience, where if you're ever defeated in battle, you lose all of you progress and must start a new playthrough. But the best games in the genre find ways to keep the early stages interesting during repeated plays. While the levels themselves are randomly generated, each stage’s main enemies and features are largely the same each time. While being fastidious, checking your map as it reveals itself, and picking your battles are all important, there’s a strong element of luck to Loot Rascals that becomes grating after a while. A handful of truly powerful, useful cards can greatly increase your chances of progress, so if you don’t encounter any of them early on, the uphill battle you’re fighting can start to feel insurmountable.Over hours of play, your success starts to feel arbitrary, and fighting your way through the first area over and over again feels rote and dull.If you’re not loaded up with cards augmented with abilities--which allow you to hit enemies from a distance with attacks and distractions--progress can stagnate. Enemies have different movement patterns and abilities, but none of them truly shake up the gameplay. It’s rare that you’ll be in a position to use your environment to your advantage or employ tactics beyond attacking or running away. The lack of a story outside of the opening and closing cutscenes means that runs never feel like narrative adventures the way they do in some stronger roguelikes. You never die with a sense that something exciting just happened, or that tragedy struck--only a sense of annoyance at needing to start over.The game does provide some help, at least: if you find a certain card in each area and return it to a character at your starting point you’ll unlock extra abilities, including a super helpful “reveal the full map” ability in the second area. However, if you don’t happen across the good cards while venturing around each map, it becomes very difficult to progress. Over hours of play, your success starts to feel arbitrary, and fighting your way through the first area over and over again feels rote and dull.Loot Rascal's simplicity ends up weakening its prospects as a long-term time investment and it’s not the kind of game that leaves you feeling like you’ve learned much from your losses. The only progress that carries over between playthroughs depends on the kindness of other players: when you die, the enemy that kills you can snatch one of your cards, and if another player encounters that enemy in their game and vanquishes the foe, they can choose to return that card to you, lest their game be haunted by your vengeful ghost.Loot Rascals card and deck systems are enticing, and its singular aesthetic and strange sense of humor make the game fundamentally likable early on. After a few hours, however, it feels like there isn't a lot to gain for all the effort you're asked to put in. There are fleeting moments of joy when a strategic card collection lets you steamroll through the enemy forces, but the monotony of getting to those moments wears you down in the end."
1836,Grand Theft Auto IV,10.0,2,"Grand Theft Auto IV you assumed the role of illegal immigrant Niko Bellic as he stepped off a boat from Eastern Europe. In The Lost &amp; Damned downloadable episode you played as biker gang member Johnny Klebitz. And now in the The Ballad of Gay Tony, which is being released both as a downloadable episode and as part of the Episodes from Liberty City stand-alone retail product, you play as nightclub owner Tony Prince's business partner and confidant, Luis Lopez.       Despite the fact that he shows no remorse, and even appears to enjoy killing people for money, Lopez is a multifaceted and extremely likable protagonist. In part, that's because he's clearly someone who wants to better himself after doing a stint in prison for dealing drugs as a teenager, even if he's not going about it in a way that any parole officer would approve of. Lopez is loyal to a fault, so while the missions you undertake in his shoes are rarely selfless acts, you often perform them primarily to help other people out. A lot of the time it's his business partner, Tony, whose life needs sorting out, but missions also come courtesy of childhood friends, the always-amusing son of an Arab billionaire, the older brother of a previously prominent character, and a disapproving mother who has fallen on hard times, to name but a few.     Depending on how you play and choose to move around the city, Lopez's never-a-dull-moment story will likely take you around 10 to 12 hours to play through. Mandatory missions are significantly more varied than those in either the original game or the previous downloadable episode. To cite examples would be to risk spoiling some of the most memorable moments, but in addition to the regular gunplay and driving, you can expect missions to incorporate plenty of helicopter combat and parachute jumps, a handful of cage fights, and even something resembling a game of golf. You can also expect to experience some missions from both Niko's and Johnny's stories from a different perspective, which will bring a smile to your face if you've played through them before. All of these missions are a lot of fun, and your performance in each of them is now rated based on the time taken, damage sustained, enemies killed, and other mission-specific criteria. Scores are then uploaded to online leaderboards, and once you've beaten the game, you have the option to revisit any mission in an attempt to improve your rating or just to play through your favorites again.       In addition to story missions, Liberty City is again filled with all manner of optional activities--many of which expand upon gameplay mechanics introduced as you progress through the game. For example, base jumping isn't something that you're required to do very often, but it's so easy to grasp and so much fun to do that after your first freefall you'll almost certainly want to check out all 15 of the optional jumps that are scattered across the city. Furthermore, there's a good chance that you'll end up making some of them multiple times, not only because riding a motorcycle off the roof of a skyscraper and then parachuting down onto a moving boat is a blast, but also because each jump has its own objective (typically a target on the ground or a moving vehicle) and is scored in the same way that missions are.     Drug Wars, another optional undertaking, are another great addition. Early on, there's a distinct lack of gunplay in Lopez's storyline, and while that's certainly not the case for the duration, you're undoubtedly going to be looking for an excuse to play with some of this episode's new weapons. Sticky bombs, a .44 pistol, an advanced sniper rifle, and an automatic shotgun with explosive rounds are all excellent additions to the GTAIV arsenal, and they're way too much fun to just have them sitting in your inventory. And that's where Drug Wars challenges come in: There are 25 in total, and they generally involve plenty of shooting as you help a couple of smalltime dealer friends to rip off their rivals.       If you'd rather test the expanded arsenal against other players than against street gangs, you can hop into The Ballad of Gay Tony's multiplayer suite at any time via an option on your in-game cell phone. Unlike The Lost &amp; Damned, which introduced a number of brand-new modes to GTAIV, this latest episode only offers modes from GTAIV, albeit enhanced with a few new features. The Free Play mode now seems designed primarily for players who want to make parachute jumps and impress one another with stats that let everyone know how long you were falling for and how close to the ground you opened your chute; Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch games benefit from the inclusion of new weapons and location options; and Race and GTA Race contests (the latter are races that encourage the use of weaponry) play quite differently now that every vehicle comes equipped with a nitrous tank that gradually refills after every death-defying use. New street circuits have clearly been designed with nitrous use in mind, because they incorporate lengthy straight sections and some spectacular jumps.       When you're not taking down drug gangs, jumping from tall buildings, or racing exotic sports cars that have never been seen in Liberty City before now, you might opt to spend some time at one of the nightclubs that you partially own, either partying or putting in some hours at work. If you do the former, you can take part in a simple champagne-drinking minigame in the VIP area or strut your stuff on the dance floor in a rhythm-based game that starts out simple but has the potential to get more challenging if everyone else on the floor decides to join in with a full routine. Other potential outcomes when you start dancing with a girl don't involve gameplay at all, and while they're hardly surprising, they're still pretty amusing.       Working in the club is a quite different experience, and while there's still some interaction with members of the fairer sex to be had, much of your time is spent walking around and keeping an eye on things. Standing in certain spots will shift you to a first-person perspective so that you can look for trouble more easily, but it's a message in your earpiece that alerts you when, for example, a drug dealer is operating inside the club and needs to be ejected. Time spent working in the club isn't particularly entertaining, and it would more or less be a waste of time if it weren't for the random missions that crop up and bring your shift to an end prematurely. These play out a lot like story missions and can include anything from helping a high-profile patron escape the paparazzi to running halfway across Liberty to fetch a snack for a supermodel while her assistant calls you every two minutes for an update.     As you'd expect, there's no shortage of humor in The Ballad of Gay Tony, and while plenty of it comes in the form of phone conversations during gameplay, a great deal of it is deftly delivered during cutscenes that are noticeably longer than those in previous games. Both Lopez and the titular ""Gay"" Tony Prince are wonderfully voiced and animated, but it's tough to call them standouts because there are so many other characters who are every bit as impressive. The cast is arguably even better than that in GTAIV, which perhaps isn't surprising given that a couple of the best characters from Nico's storyline make cameo appearances in Lopez's.   Republican Space Rangers cartoon, but also an amusing anime spoof titled Princess Robot Bubblegum.     lot of content here, even if you just play through the superb story without ever checking out any of the optional activities. You might be disappointed that this episode doesn't bring much in the way of new multiplayer content to the table, and it's true that one or two of the optional activities aren't as much fun as they might have been, but the incredible value offered by The Ballad of Gay Tony is undeniable. This is superb additional content for one of the very best games of last year, and you won't want to stop playing it until you've sat through the entertaining and enlightening end credits.  "
4122,Steel Horizon,4.0,0,"  Earlier this year, Konami released Steel Horizon for the Nintendo DS. Billed as a naval ""strategy"" game, Steel Horizon offered a not-yet-played-out take on World War II combat, but it dealt in extremely shallow gameplay. That game has now reemerged on the PlayStation Portable. While Konami has certainly put the intermittent three months to use, the fruit of the team's efforts remains much the same. Other than a surprisingly enjoyable storyline, fans of turn-based strategy games will find little to like, and much to loathe, about Steel Horizon.     This may or may not come as a surprise to you, but Hitler was kind of insane. This and other history lessons are dished up in Steel Horizon, which presents a fairly entertaining narrative on the occult aspects of WWII that's comparable to anything you might find in an Indiana Jones movie or Hellboy comic. The story is noteworthy, even commendable, in that it doesn't devolve into the typical American military brouhaha, as both German and Japanese soldiers are portrayed in an honorable light altogether separate from the megalomaniacal urges displayed by higher-ups on all sides of the conflict. It's a story worth telling, which is why it's a crying shame that few will be able to withstand the gameplay long enough to see its end.         Steel Horizon's greatest flaw is that for a strategy game, it comes up woefully short on the strategy. Aside from your one flagship that you begin the game with, you aren't able to upgrade individual ships in your fleet, so you'll deploy mostly the same boats throughout the game. Resources, which are used to purchase ships, accrue by controlling shipyards scattered about the map, but these are never particularly scarce, and you'll only come up wanting for funds in the very beginning of each stage. Ships come in 14 different flavors, but you'll pragmatically settle on three or four types to flesh out your fleet. This is, of course, unless you become saddled with ships you don't want, which frequently occurs. Most missions will start you off with an entire host, including many ships you'd never intentionally commission. Since you can't scuttle or dock the ones you don't want, your only recourse is to either send them to the wolves, which is as much a hassle as it is a time sink, or ignore them completely. However, this can cause problems, because you're allowed only eight groups total, and a single useless ship off by its lonesome counts as a full group.     This isn't to say you'll need all eight of those groups, though, as missions won't tax your frontal lobe in the least. A balanced flotilla will sink anything you run up against, and though the enemy artificial intelligence is slightly improved in the PSP version, it still isn't that good, so you'll typically always have the upper hand. There's also not much variety to liven up the experience. By the fifth mission of going up against the same enemies with the same outfit under the same terms for victory, you may get a bit antsy. By the 10th, you'll wonder if the story's conclusion is really worth the tedium. By the 15th, your eyes will take on a zealous glint as you stubbornly and wantonly fling yourself into the next scenario. And by the 20th hour-long mission, you'll be bobbing your head, agreeing with the robed men that humanity must die.      Perhaps to differentiate itself from the crowd, Konami thought it might be a good idea to incorporate some button-mashing elements into the game's battle sequences. Instead of just quickly simming each encounter, as those who play these types of turn-based strategy games are used to, you'll instead have to endure a 60-second battle that essentially involves you cycling through your ships and hitting the X button when prompted to fire your guns. In this regard, the PSP version at least lets you know when each ship's special attack is available, whereas in the DS version you simply had to guess. You're technically also able to reposition your ship, but it's difficult to judge where you're going on the map, and the encounter area is too small and the battles are too short for it to matter much anyway.      Steel Horizon will occupy a significant amount of your time if you let it. Each of the 20 missions averages between 45 minutes to an hour, with the vast majority of that time being spent traversing the open seas, sailing a few uneventful squares at a time. It just takes too long to do anything. This is mainly because there's some kind of lag or processing delay on all of your actions, which becomes excessively irritating extremely fast. It also doesn't help that you'll be digging through a good deal of menus, as everything from moving to attacking to altering the orientation of your ship is buried somewhere. Further, instead of letting you choose the exact route you want to take with your ships, you must cycle through every feasible route on the grid to find the one you want. And even then, you can't always box around minefields without traveling a shorter distance than what you'd otherwise be capable of.     But wait, there's more. If you wanted to see what the game would be like without its one redeeming quality, you can subject yourself to 21 skirmish missions that are by and large exactly like the missions in the story mode, sans the story. If you and a like-minded individual are so inclined, ad hoc multiplayer is also an option. However, with the way turns play out, it would have been functionally the same to just pass the PSP back and forth. And be sure to have a charger handy, because as long and drawn out as the single-player missions are, multiplayer takes that much longer. With both of these modes, it would have been nice to at least be able to use the flagship you improved over the course of the single-player campaign. As it is, you just start out with generic ships.         Aside from a few nice-looking cinematics, Steel Horizon doesn't have a particularly remarkable look. The overhead grid is pretty much what you'd expect from a strategy game. Though you'll play in both the Pacific and Atlantic, environments in the battle sequences all look the same--which is to say, there's a lot of ocean and nothing else. There are a fair number of explosions during these sequences, and the PSP version has the added effect of a bit more animation when you fire off your ships' special weapons. Ships now reflect their current state of damage in this version, as well. The presentation really takes a hit with the game's interface, which is sorely lacking. There are no onscreen indicators of your ships' health other than ambiguous colors, and the slight delay discussed above makes it a real bear to dig through menus. Likewise, the game's soundtrack is ridiculously monotonous. A single maritime march loops for the vast majority of the game, and combat noises have never sounded so passive.      To be sure, the PSP version of Steel Horizon is a superior, more complete game than the DS version. However, the real meat of the experience--the core, underlying mechanics--remains by and large unaltered. The strategy is still mindless, the interface is still cumbersome, and the fun factor is still absent. The story notwithstanding, there's not much worth justifying the price of admission on this one.  "
4566,Q*bert,4.0,0,"The typical retro-game update these days takes a pretty standard approach. Find a 2D classic arcade game, put it in polygons, give it some sort of quest-type feel, and put it on shelves. While the 1982 arcade game Q*Bert already had a bit of a 3D element to it, it's been given the standard treatment. But awkward level design and poor presentation make the 1999 release of Q*Bert a dull endeavor, to say the least. Not too many gameplay elements have changed here. Q*Bert is still a crazy orange... uh... ball thing. OK, picture a ball with two legs, two eyes, and a vacuum-cleaner hose as a nose/mouth combo sort-of-thing. Your world is made up of tons of connected cubes. Your job is to change the color of the cubes by hopping from cube to cube. Each cube you touch changes color. Various obstacles and monsters stand in your way - from bouncing balls to returning evildoers Coily, Ugg, and Wrong-Way, who all hop around on the cubes hoping to land on our hero, which, as in the old version, causes Q*Bert to emit a bellow of cartoon cursing. While every level in the original game (which is contained on the disc and is playable with classic or updated graphics, though the between-level music is different than the original) was a simple pyramid, the updated game goes crazy with its level design. The problem here is that it's occasionally very hard to judge depth, and at times the levels look like they came right off the desk of MC Escher himself. This makes hopping around a real chore, and it's occasionally tough to see how all the cubes line up. In the game's standard mode, along with all the old Q*Bert gameplay elements, are things like power-ups. Shields, keys, bombs, torches, and more can be found on the game's various levels. The items don't really mix up the gameplay at all, and the game gets boring within 30 minutes. A two-player head-to-head mode is also included where you can try to recolor your cubes before your friend can change all of his. The game's graphics have been updated in the most basic way. Everything has become polygonal, but that's about it. So Q*Bert looks a little more robust now, and he squashes down when he lands from a jump. The new sounds used in the game really don't add anything to the game, and the trademark noise that Q*Bert made when he jumped still sounds much, much cooler. It would have been nice to see a history section, complete with clips of the short-lived Q*Bert cartoon. Also, the Q*Bert sequel, Q*Bert's Qubes, and the never-released Faster, Harder, More Challenging Q*Bert would have made nice additions to the classic section of the game. As it stands, the game just doesn't have enough substance to last more than a day. If you absolutely, positively must know, do yourself a favor and just rent it."
3974,Zatch Bell! Mamodo Fury,5.0,1,"  To the uninitiated, the intense, off-the-wall style of Zatch Bell! might seem uniquely bizarre, but its premise is really quite simple. There's a cast of hyper, interesting characters backed by a plot that basically just gives the characters a reason to fight one another. It's a design that works in publisher Namco Bandai's favor because it can just as easily be a video game as it can be anime, manga, or a collectible card game, which makes for seemingly endless opportunities to create effortless cash-ins. And that's exactly what Zatch Bell! Mamodo Fury is--a simplistic game built on the notion that fans of the license don't want or need anything more than to see their favorite characters in yet another venue, with no regard for the depth or quality of the experience. To its credit, the game does deliver a sizable cast of characters, a lengthy story mode, and a handful of ancillary gameplay modes. However, there's nothing in Mamodo Fury to instill a greater appreciation for the Zatch Bell! universe, and the fighting is much too shallow and repetitive to be fun.          The story is about as vague as can be in Mamodo Fury. Every 1,000 years, demons known as mamodos come to earth to duke it out for the title of mamodo king. These mamodos can't fight alone, though. They need a human counterpart to read spells from a magic book. That means that you have a bunch of relatively normal humans, each with a quirky demon sidekick, who randomly encounter one another and engage in drawn-out, overblown battles. For all the time that it takes to fight, the story never goes anywhere, and the fighting accomplishes absolutely nothing.      That wouldn't be a problem if the fighting was actually fun, but it isn't. Mamodo Fury is a one-button fighting game. By default, you control a human character, and you hold the square button to cast spells with your mamodo. Depending on how long you hold the button, you'll charge up the level of the spells and your mamodo will perform different attacks. Each mamodo has four regular attacks, a defensive spell, and one super attack. However, you'll usually end up firing off the first-level spell because it's fast and usually the most effective technique. That means that the fighting consists of you running around tapping the square button over and over until you finish off your enemy. To make the combat even more tedious, you have a power gauge that determines how many times you can cast a spell. If your gauge is depleted, you have to wait until it recharges before you can attack. As a result, you'll usually end up firing off about three spells, then running around or hiding behind a barrier until your power is replenished, then repeating the same routine half a dozen times. There is a very minor payoff for doing this, because you'll charge up your super power. When you've done enough damage, you'll see an icon appear on the screen. At that point, you can charge up your attack all the way to initiate a super move. You then have a few seconds to press a random string of buttons, and then you can increase the strength of the attack by hitting another, separate, and once again random string of buttons. These super moves inflict major damage and are a guaranteed hit, so with any luck, a single move will put an end to the fight as soon as you unleash it.      There are a few ways to mix up the fighting, but they don't make it any more enjoyable. As a human character, you can't attack a mamodo, but you can attack another human character. You can run up to the opposing human character and try to knock the spell book out of his or her hands. If the collision detection is feeling favorable toward you at that moment, you'll knock the book away and your opponent won't be able to cast any spells until he or she retrieves the book. More often than not, you'll get right up on your opponent and whiff time and time again as you try to land a hit, and even if you do knock the book away, it will only buy you a couple of seconds, so it's not an effective way to fight.      You can also take direct control of your mamodo. Doing so leaves your human character immobile and vulnerable, but the benefit is that your power gauge recharges faster, and as a mamodo, you can directly damage another mamodo using the single melee attack you have at your disposal. Again, this technique isn't useful in the average fight, because leaving your human character in one spot is a surefire way to get creamed, and as the mamodo, you'll run into the aggravating problem of spotty collision detection.          The problems of the shallow fighting mechanics are compounded by basic flaws in execution, as well. The game takes place from a behind-the-back perspective, which means that you constantly have to adjust the camera using the right analog stick. Your view will also often be obstructed by various objects in the environment. In addition to the camera problems, the deficient artificial intelligence is a regular source of frustration. Usually, your mamodo will stay close as you run around each stage, but often it will end up getting stuck behind low-lying barriers or stalwart hazards such as small shrubs or rocks. The enemy AI is no better. Your opponents will often get stuck on bits of the environment or will run in place up against a small obstruction rather than simply jumping over it.     It's a shame that the gameplay is so unfulfilling, because there's plenty of it to be found in Mamodo Fury. There are 20 playable character combinations in the game, as well as a decent number of stages to choose from. Unfortunately, just about everything other than story mode is locked at the beginning of the game, so you have to put in a lot of time to access all of the content. There's the standard arcade mode and versus mode, as well as a very lengthy story mode. There are more than 30 stages to fight your way through in story mode, with an impressive variety of enemies to fight and special conditions to meet. In some of the story modes, you simply have to defeat the enemy before time runs out, but occasionally the game mixes the formula up by giving you specific conditions for completing a stage. You might have to knock the book out of your opponent's hands, use a specific attack to defeat your foe, or simply survive for a set amount of time. These stages do break up the tedium of endless one-button fighting, but they still aren't fun or interesting, and they suffer from the same underlying problems that persist throughout the game. There are also a handful of minigames to play, where you take control of Zatch and do activities like sneak past guards to enter buildings, collect pieces of lost candy for a friend, or retrieve a stolen toy from a playground bully. The minigames require slightly more input than the fighting, but once you play each one a couple of times, you'll be ready to move on.      Mamodo Fury does support up to four players, but not in the way that you might think. Instead of having four-player versions of the normal versus battles, you get a couple of lame minigames to play. For example, in one game you have to run around and try to kick your opponents' books into a fire, and in another you have to be the first to collect a number of fish. These minigames are so simple you don't even need four controllers to play them; you can actually have two players share a controller since all the games require is one analog stick and one button for each player. If you want to fight, you're limited to two-player versus battles. In these battles, the screen is split down the middle, but otherwise they play exactly as the other battles in the game. It's a little bit more interesting to play against a human opponent, but the action is so repetitive that you'll quickly get bored.           If you didn't know any better, you could easily mistake Mamodo Fury for any number of other anime-inspired fighting games. The characters are all faithfully represented, and the stages are generic, but they're large and filled with breakable objects. The story sequences are ridiculous but occasionally worth at least a chuckle. Unfortunately, a good deal of charm is lost in the translation from the bright and busy 2D animated show to the flat, generic 3D cel-shading of the game. Some of the spell effects are flashy and interesting to see, but since each character has only a couple of spells, the effects get played out almost immediately. The audio is especially disappointing in Mamodo Fury. The English-language voice cast is on hand to lend its talent, but that is the only highlight of the sound. The music sounds like a throwback to the 8-bit console generation, and not in a good way. The sound effects during battle are all distorted, as if they were rerecorded sounds from old cassette tapes. The most annoying aspect of the sound design is the noise the characters make each time they cast a spell. Each character has one battle cry for each spell, but since you'll usually be using the same spell over and over, you'll constantly hear the same annoying phrase from your character. It goes the same for the enemies you face, too, so during the average three-minute fight, your ears will be continually assaulted by one cringe-inducing voice clip after another, and you'll likely be scrambling for the mute button within the first few minutes of playing the game.     With its sizable cast of characters and lengthy story mode, Zatch Bell! Mamodo Fury offers a lot of very familiar content in one package. However, the gameplay is far too shallow and frustrating to be satisfying. If you're unfamiliar with Zatch Bell! this isn't a good place to start, because it provides no context for the license and does nothing to appeal to those who aren't already intimately familiar with the series. The result is just another perfunctory anime-inspired fighting game that fails to distinguish itself beyond its license.     "
2595,Hoodwink,3.0,0,"                 Hoodwink doesn't actually have a plot. It's more of a teaser for a plot that does not, and might never, exist. There's an illusion that your actions--from both before the game begins and the duration in which you play--are going to be explained. You find you've been tricked by a world that suggests it has a larger meaning, or tale to tell, when in fact it doesn't. You will never know what led Michael Bezzle to the ring, what any of the (very few) plot points mean, or where the journey is going.      "
947,Surviving Mars,8.0,2,"It's been said that city simulators are best thought of as a series of stocks and flows. You have essential buildings that supply resources, which are then distributed in a grand pattern etched by your design. Your success, then, depends on how artfully and effectively you've crafted your settlement. If that is the measure by which we are to judge city simulators, nowhere is that more beautifully or essentially or thematically distilled than in Surviving Mars.Space is hard, and Mars isn't any more forgiving; your goal is to command a mission that can endure the punishing conditions of the Red Planet. You can take the reigns of an international consortium, a major private enterprise, or any number of real-world space-capable nations here on Earth. From there, you choose how to guide your Martian colony. Insofar as many simulators allow a degree of role-playing, your time on Mars is yours to do with how you will. But your progress is constantly evaluated by your sponsor country or organization, offering some very loose targets like ""get colonists"" and ""keep them alive for a while."" Beyond that, the direction is yours.Your first forays on the planet are drone-based; RC rovers and semi-autonomous bots are your essential tools. They help you probe the surface of Mars and get your basics going. You have a bevy of options for obtaining vital resources--with each creating a slightly different relationship between your settlement and the planet. That's because everything here degrades. Ground down by the perpetual dust storms, punishing cold, and meteor strikes, nothing lasts and everything comes with a cost. Whether it's by extracting from rock, or sucking what little can be from the scant Martian atmosphere, even something as basic as how you obtain water influences countless other decisions down the line.Choose the extractor, and then you need to design your outpost around the fact that it'll kick up far more corrosive dust into the air (among a half-dozen other considerations). The extractor's cousin, the vaporator, is a more environmentally friendly option...but at the cost of comparably low output, and requiring broad spacing between structures to be effective. The brilliance of Surviving Mars, then, is in forcing you to think systemically. Each choice is a commitment, a statement of how you think it best to run humanity's excursion to the new frontier.Surviving Mars gets a lot of narrative mileage from this. As you progress, you're always fighting the exaggerated elements and forces of nature. Your structures are always degrading, and help of any sort is often months away--meaning that you either have strong supply lines for the necessary materials, or you're prepared to work around the long delays in resupply missions from Earth. Because your colony's development is connected to these choices, it also creates a powerful emergent narrative throughout, not unlike ones found in The Sims, for instance.Those decisions might feel like setting up a trap down the line, but Surviving Mars' other stroke of genius is how permissive it can be. Instead of locking you into a given play style, the emphasis is on consequences and teaching you how to manage them. Your colony, at its most basic level, is governed by a set of rules. If you have X building, every so often you'll need Y resource to maintain it, and that resource comes from Z building, and so on.The brilliance here is that all of these systems work and are responsive to how you play. Every choice matters, but none rule your destiny. Even if you can't get what you need from a Martian mine just yet, you can order it from Earth. Each of those choices, too, have consequences, though. And that means that at some point, you either fail to meet a condition and the system starts falling apart, or you keep going and surviving.What helps here is that Surviving Mars may be delicate, but it isn't punishing. Sure, the in-game consequences of failure are...a little extreme (like watching your colonists suffocate, should you fail to keep oxygen flowing). But you'll often have plenty of time to fix them, and a series of warnings that encourage you to change course. How you do so, again, comes down to which consequences you want to take on, and how long you can keep paying those costs--at least, at the most basic level. At times, Surviving Mars may underemphasize some key parts--namely just how important supply chain management is--but it's delightful and elegant, tasking you with just enough management and planning to keep your role engaging. As you progress, drones can take on more, leaving you to handle larger-scale plans for the settlement.That allows you to graduate to managing the lives of the colonists, your relationship with Earth, the fineries of your supply chains, and new expansions and additions to your colony (which follow their own systems and sets of rules). What makes all of this work is precisely that it is so scalably complex, gives generally great feedback on how well your choices are working, and giving you progressively larger goals to chip away at. It's a strong set of basic ideas that keep the game consistently engaging, and allows you to open up new fronts and address new challenges--like getting another adjacent settlement going--as you build the confidence to work through them.Surviving Mars is SimCity with soul.A more traditional, optional narrative is available as well. Each time you play, you'll eventually discover some sort of mystery, be it colonists with weird visions, disturbing black cubes, or legit aliens. These will nudge your colony in more specific directions, if you decide that it's something you want to explore. Often, these mysteries require you to do something specific, like construct a special building to start a sequence of narrative vignettes. While the core play of ""maintain and survive against all odds on the Martian surface"" should be a big enough hook for many players, it's nice to have an optional story that addresses the mythology of the planet throughout our real-world history and pop culture.And that's just it. Mars is more than a planet--it's the next big goal for a healthy portion of people here on Earth. Surviving Mars nods to that with a pursuit of real-world influences and designs, plus as many plausible technologies as it can pack in. While the game definitely takes some liberties, most of the structures, ships, and technologies will be familiar to fans of spaceflight. The basic supply and passenger ships, for instance, are modeled after SpaceX's forthcoming BFR ships.Surviving Mars, above else, is about hope. So many strategy games hold to their gameplay, eschewing any overarching themes or messages. But, as corny as it sounds, for those who believe in the majesty of spaceflight, for those who are keen to marvel at how pernicious our plucky little species can be, Surviving Mars is SimCity with soul. It shows the challenges that come along with planetary migration, but it also shows that they are solvable. With the right planning, drive, and ingenuity, we can do great things together."
385,Control,8.0,2,"Editor's note: Following the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, developer Remedy Entertainment has released Control: Ultimate Edition. This new version of Control includes all of its previously released DLC, including its story expansions The Foundation and AWE, and comes with new improvements over the last-gen version. Below are our impressions of how Control: Ultimate Edition runs on PS5, written by Phil Hornshaw. You can also read our full PlayStation 5 review for an in-depth breakdown of the console. Continue after the break for the original Control review.Control is gorgeous and intense on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but the Ultimate Edition on the current generation of consoles is Remedy Entertainment's excellent 2019 game at its best. Control Ultimate Edition is a prettier, more stable way to enjoy Remedy's strange paranormal world, and on PlayStation 5, it works in the great features of the DualSense to elevate the experience even more.The primary difference between the original edition of Control and the Ultimate Edition is the latter's enhanced graphics. The Ultimate Edition offers two different modes: Performance, which prioritizes frame rate, and Graphics, which leverages the hardware for better textures, lighting, and ray tracing. In both modes, though, the difference between the Ultimate Edition and the standard version of Control is stark. These are drastic improvements over Control on the PS4 and make an already beautiful game look and play even better.The graphics-heavy mode is something to behold. Control is full of reflective surfaces, whether they're glass office walls or puddles of water or blood in its dark, brutalist halls. With ray tracing enabled, the game becomes full of gorgeous, real-world reflections, with protagonist Jesse's face appearing on the screens of TVs as she watches films created by Dr. Casper Darling, and Control's stark lighting and cinematography finding mirrors in wet concrete floors. Control's art direction was already impressive, but it achieves even more on the newer hardware to create endless beautiful frames.Graphics mode sacrifices frame rate for those pretty images, but it never chugs or runs poorly (unlike the base game on PS4 Pro)--its frame rate looks to be on par with the last generation of hardware, but with more stability. Flipping to the performance mode sacrifices those beautiful reflections in favor of a silky 60fps, but Control looks great in both modes. The smoothness afforded by the higher frame rate definitely works to make combat feel a little more intense and responsive, but both modes work extremely well, so choosing one comes down to personal preference.On PS5, Control Ultimate Edition benefits from the DualSense controller's haptic feedback. The intensity of Jesse's footsteps when she's running or walking are translated to the controller, as are the different firing modes of the Service Weapon as you let loose with the automatic Spin or charge up a big blast with Pierce. Best, though, are Jesse's powers, with the controller adding oomph to the massive blast of a melee attack and capturing the whistling catch as you use telekinesis to grab hold of a piece of concrete. The haptics add just a little something extra to Control, helping to make Jesse's powers and weapons feel distinct and impactful.When you're so used to games that ease you in, the confronting nature of Control is immediately compelling. There's plenty of time to get to know characters, study the environment, and gradually pick up new mechanics and skills, but Control's sinister atmosphere is impactful, sending a rush of questions through your head from the moment you press start.Who is Jesse Faden? Why does she seem both lost and found on her first day as director at the Federal Bureau of Control? How can she possibly maintain her composure in the face of the haunting ethereal and material distortions that have overtaken the bureau? You may only have some answers to these questions by the time the credits roll. While being vague or opaque could be viewed as a flaw in other games, obfuscation is part of what makes Control so spellbinding. Impressively, the mysteries grip ever tighter as you navigate the bureau's headquarters in search of answers. Knowledge is power, but it frequently opens doors to possibilities you never knew existed--doors that are better left shut, so far as Jesse and surviving FBC members are concerned.If you've played past works from Remedy Games, you will instantly recognize the studio's footprint. Control's story plays with grim truths and strange themes. Everything is a serious matter, except when it isn't and a dark sense of humor creeps in to offer a momentary respite--which, yes, includes plenty of FMV shorts. The combat system is designed for you to be equal parts agile and destructive, bearing a notable resemblance to the studio's Microsoft-exclusive, Quantum Break. Combat aside, that game felt like a step removed from what Remedy does best. Control feels like Remedy has found its footing again.There is one major aspect that is decidedly new for Remedy: Control is non-linear, built in the vein of a metroidvania and filled with reasons to retrace your steps over time. This approach is largely handled well, though if there's any aspect of Control that feels lacking it's the handling of the map. It's an unreliable tool presented in a top-down fashion that often feels like more trouble than it's worth. Multi-level areas overlap with one another (you can't isolate them, or zoom in for a closer look) and it's practically impossible to track specific locations you have or have not visited. Broad areas can be tracked, sure, but not, say, a single meeting room in the executive branch.This would be a major issue if not for two things: The signage in the world is surprisingly helpful, and ultimately, Control makes wandering the halls of ""The Oldest House"" a consistent pleasure. If you aren't in awe of the architecture, you're probably getting your kicks from a battle that pops up when you least expected it.Referring to the FBC headquarters as a house is a bit misleading, though you'll grow to understand how in time. In practical terms, it is a massive multi-story facility that screams government, with angular interiors formed in stone and metal, with minimal flourish. It has the outward appearance of an orderly place of process, which, while true, undersells the reality therein, or the lack thereof.The dance between fact and fiction is at the heart of Control's setting and a fascinating narrative that unravels in Jesse's mind through a series of inner monologues and psychic projections. There are exchanges between characters that move certain elements forward, but so much of Control hinges on Jesse's discoveries and her interpretations of their meaning. Even though you're clued into her thoughts, there's an underlying element that Jesse fails to explain because, to her, it's matter-of-fact. Whatever it is has always been a part of her, creating a gap of understanding that you, for the most part, can only hope to fill in with your own inferences. There's a constant desire to know more, yet to also maintain distance from the truth in order to preserve the mystery. It's to Control's credit that it effortlessly facilitates this exchange.If it's otherworldly, if it seems to defy explanation, odds are the FBC is running tests to discover the underlying cause and contain the consequences from the outside world. Deep within the guts of the house lie experiments and studies that dig into paranormal disturbances, the collective subconscious, and alternate dimensions. The FBC posits that entities from beyond our realm have used objects of power--archetypical things that we know and take for granted--as gateways into our world. After years of the FBC gathering these strange objects for study, the house has become an amplified conduit for a force known as The Hiss, which can reshape and move matter. The source of this power, a dimension known as the Astral Plane, has crept into the bureau, and some far-off corridors bear its telltale monochromatic, geometric motif. Occasionally, you will get pulled into this strange world to undergo skill trials, but your visits are always short, which helps preserve the mystique in the long run.Back in the ""real"" world, lowly agents and high-ranking FBC enforcers have been corrupted en masse. Many float harmlessly in mid-air, chanting strange mantras in boardrooms, hallways, and research facilities. Generally, if there's headroom, there are floaters. The more aggressive of the bunch pop into existence before your eyes as you explore the bureau. They, like Jesse, fight with a mix of guns and telekinetic powers. They are generally fun adversaries, and battles are punctuated by some incredible special effects. Furniture and small props are whipped into a frenzy when you hurl a desk from a cubicle and into a group of enemies. Sparks and colorful plumes of energy fill the air when a nearby explosion cuts through the incandescent trails left behind by the hiss.There are only a few unique enemies or bosses to speak of, but by and large the AI, in conjunction with a great variety of architectural layouts, makes every fight feel engaging. Whether a simple encounter or a complex assault, you have to approach combat with a juggling act in mind, shifting between expending ammunition and psychic energy when one or the other is depleted. You also have to learn how to defend against and recover from harm. The only way to heal in combat is to pick up essence dropped by fallen enemies, which often requires you to throw yourself into the fray while also protecting yourself from further damage.New powers come with story milestones, but weapon forms are crafted from collectible materials. Their stats, and Jesse's, increase with the application of randomized ranked mods dropped by enemies and found in hidden containment chests. You will likely come across hundreds of mods, but because you can only hold and use a limited amount, you will end up dismantling most of them to make space in your inventory. Mods can make a tangible difference, especially once you start to find high-ranking ones, but they can't make up for a lack of skill or understanding of Jesse's tools during the game's greatest tests.Control is a great-looking game in general, from the overall art design to the technical execution, but combat is a notable standout in that regard. While the experience on PC can be tuned to run at a consistently smooth frame rate, the PS4 version (playing on a PS4 Pro with supersampling enabled) can exhibit stuttering when fights are at their most chaotic--no issues were spotted with the Xbox One version. This, thankfully, is an uncommon occurrence, but it definitely clues you in to how taxing the special effects and real-time physics are.With a fair amount of extracurricular exploration, it took me about 15 hours to get to the end of Control's campaign. Though I watched the credits roll, there are still plenty of side quests for me to tackle. Jesse isn't the only sane person in the bureau after all, and the handful of key NPCs that populate each sector have co-workers gone missing or projects left abandoned that might put the bureau at future risk. They not only give you more reason to spend time in Jesse's shoes, but the supporting cast is great across the board, brought to life with excellent voice acting and top-notch character design. They aren't deep characters and your conversations never go very far, but I'm more than willing to help them in their time of need, if only to see what quirky or oddball thing they say when I return.One of my favorite aspects of Control, now that I've got room to breathe, is spending quality time with its collectible texts and videos. I've managed to read most of the in-game materials while pushing through main missions and tackling optional pursuits, but there are so many fascinating threads to pull on that it's easy to imagine new possibilities lying in wait; if only I studied the evidence a little closer, or considered a new angle, maybe the missing pieces of Jesse's story would come into view. These tidbits can be educational, disturbing, and at times wildly entertaining, and they have inspired me to look deeper into topics like Jungian psychology.It's not often that a game invades my thoughts the way Control has. I'm at the point where I want to consume every last thing it has to offer. And if I'm honest, it also makes me want to go back and replay Remedy's past games, too. Sure, it's a faulty metroidvania in some respects, but there are so many exceptional qualities afoot that Control handily deflects any momentary ire. I can't wait to take part in discussions about the game, to see what others have figured out, and to better understand where it all fits into Jesse's story."
1345,Odin Sphere Leifthrasir,8.0,2,"Well, I suppose you might get a little cross. One of the five playable characters, the fairy called Mercedes, makes an insufferable squeak when performing actions like reloading her bow, and the recurring “blathering ingenue is forced to prove her worth” theme repeats often enough to get maudlin. But like any softy, I am as swept up by the fantasy as I was when Odin Sphere was first released in 2007. The first chapter, starring the Valkyrie Gwendolyn, sets a whimsical tone for the game to follow, and its tale of improbable love and family tragedy is still my favorite of the lot. Developer Vanillaware’s trademark painted visuals do much of the work in this regard. You can’t help but gawk at the starry sky from Gwendolyn’s balcony, or at Gwendolyn herself, whose three-tiered dress in certain story scenes is the very essence of Disney fairy-tales. Or consider her father Odin, whose cape flutters wondrously behind him on winds of unknown origin. (Or perhaps on the winds of his own farts. Who’s to say?)Such is the power of a colorful tale that only in retrospect do I wonder if Gwendolyn wasn’t suffering from some form of Stockholm Syndrome, given the nature of the romance she gets involved in. Regardless, it’s the kind of romance you see in musical theater or in opera, where all it takes is the space of a song and a few coy gestures for you to be believe a couple has fallen in love. And so it goes from beginning to end, introducing you to, among others, a prince turned into a bunnylike Pooka; a troubled survivor trying to prevent the very end of the world; and the queen of the netherworld, whose spitefulness makes that of Sleeping Beauty’s Maleficent pale in comparison.The five main chapters, as well as the ones you might unlock if you’re industrious enough, wind in and out of each other, lending new perspective to previous plot points. This entails a certain amount of repetition--you see the same characters from new angles, while traversing the same areas and encountering the same enemies. Yet Odin Sphere Leifthrasir is largely successful at fending off monotony, engaging you with its action-packed combat, and by keeping battles short and sweet, much like Gwendolyn herself.Whether you’re armed with Oswald’s sword or Mercedes’ bow, murdering ice trolls and salamanders always feels fluid and natural.Structurally, Odin Sphere is a role-playing game: you level up as you play, and spend skill points on new magical abilities, and upgrades to abilities you have already unlocked. Moment to moment, Odin Sphere is a 2D beat-em-up in which you string together slashes, aerial juggles, slide-kicks, and so forth until the screen is awash with wind and flame. Every character is responsive to your button-presses and stick-nudges. Whether you’re armed with Oswald’s sword or Mercedes’ bow, murdering ice trolls and salamanders always feels fluid and natural. It certainly helps that the frame rate holds up beautifully, whereas the original performed disastrously.You can further mix up the combat rhythm by tossing a single-use spell flask into the mix, thus summoning a volcano onto the battlefield, or enveloping the area in a toxic cloud. Enemies sometimes drop such flasks upon defeat, but you can also make them yourself using Odin Sphere Leifthrasir’s alchemy system, which benefits from a nice interface upgrade over the original. Things can still get a bit fiddly: there’s no obvious upside to your limited inventory space, so you end up backtracking through levels to get to a storage chest, which muddles the pace. But Odin Sphere’s flashes of brilliance overshadow its bungles.The way health and leveling are handled is one such example. You can plant seeds almost anywhere and grow plants that yield various fruits, or even sheep. (Yes, sheep, which yield tasty lamb chops.) You can also visit a restaurant and order some victuals, or call on the traveling chef, who unfolds his table with unparalleled stylishness. Wherever your treats come from, they not only restore your health, but they also grant experience points. It’s a terrific confluence of two systems that grants you both a short-term recovery benefit (healing) and a long-term recovery benefit (gaining levels and growing more powerful). It also minimizes grind, since you needn’t engage in unnecessary battles to level up. The downside: eating when your health is full can sometimes feel like you’re wasting the benefit, but you are rarely short on edibles, so the sense of waste is more of an emotional response than a practical concern.You see the same sights and converse with the same people again and again, but the brevity of battle and the incessant supply of rewards and accompanying triumphant music keep the atmosphere lively.Level design is another example of Odin Sphere’s cleverness. Though each side-scrolling level is functionally flat, it’s actually a circle, so you always end up back where you started if you run in a single direction. It’s not a novel concept--Defender was doing this back in 1981--but this device makes Odin Sphere easy to navigate, and its minimaps easy to understand. Furthermore, levels are small, and standard enemy encounters usually last under 45 seconds. You’re rewarded with a score and a reward for your prowess--a delightful showering of coins, and perhaps a new recipe, a flask, or an equippable accessory. You see the same sights and converse with the same people again and again, but the brevity of battle and the incessant supply of rewards and accompanying triumphant music keep the atmosphere lively.Note that the combat system is not as it was in the original, though a slightly enhanced version of the original is included in this package, if you prefer it. On the whole, Leifthrasir is smoother and quicker than the original, not only due to new moves and attacks, but also due to a change to the power meter. No longer does power decrease with standard attacks, except in Mercedes’ case, and no longer can you damage yourself with your own spells. These are fundamental changes that makes boss fights easier than before, and allow you to play more offensively. I like the new system, frankly, but I also found myself wishing I could enjoy the new presentation--new scenes, new visuals, greater field of view--while using the original combat. If you want to see the new content and presentation but prefer the old battle system, you’re out of luck.That’s a disappointing turn of events if you’re one to resist change, but I prefer the new combat, all in all. It’s snappy, it’s got momentum, and it keeps me in the thick of the action, whether I’m fighting off fairies and frogs, or whether a gargantuan dragon is charging at me. He’s a lovely dragon, too, with a throaty baritone delivery and a desire to help you out, even if you just spent the last few minutes slashing at his scales and setting him on fire. He’s one of Odin Sphere Leifthrasir’s many joys, though he’s not the game’s sole defining element. There is Cornelius’s dramatic pose as he receives rewards; there is the dwarven skyship, and all the Steampunk sensibilities it entails. If I had to choose just one detail as a favorite, however, it comes back to Maury, the traveling chef, and the enthusiasm and flair with which he unpacks his supplies. He brings to his world the same amount of cheer that Odin Sphere Leifthrasir brings to me--and who couldn’t use a little more cheer?"
1446,DiRT Rally,8.0,2,"I yank the wheel to avoid ploughing into the nearest tree, and then I’m off again; hastily angling the car for an upcoming hairpin turn before vigorously pulling on the handbrake at just the right moment to whip the backend out and round the tricky bend. The back wheels of my Impreza throw up a deluge of mud and leaves that rain down on a gathering of ecstatic rally fans as though it were nature’s own confetti. The gearbox gets back to work. I hit the gas again, accelerating into another straight, shifting up with a mechanical clank of discordant machinery as I blast through a clearing in the trees. Only this time I overshoot the next bend and, in soggy ditch somewhere along this strip of Welsh countryside, I stop dead.Just like that--a single lapse of concentration--and my race is all over.During its eight months on Steam Early Access, Dirt Rally earned itself quite the reputation of moments like this. The Dark Souls of driving games is a term I’ve seen in certain corners of the internet, and the comparison couldn’t be more apt. Like with From Software’s seminal RPG, Codemasters’ latest is uncompromisingly difficult while also rewarding those who are willing to master its intricate mechanics and, perhaps most importantly, show a little dare.If you hadn’t already guessed, this isn’t like previous Dirt games where racing disciplines were plentiful, and where the focus was on X Games pomp along with accessible, almost arcade-style racing. No, Dirt Rally shifts the spotlight away from the bombast of its lineage, strips everything back to basics, and presents a merciless simulation of rally that celebrates the unbridled purity of this brutal motorsport.If you can’t tell a Scandinavian flick from an opposite lock, your first few hours with Dirt Rally are going to be rough--make no bones about it. When I first started playing it was an accomplishment just to finish a stage in one piece, let alone setting a competitive time. With no tutorials to speak of--a disappointment considering training akin to Richard Burns Rally’s driving school would have been ideal--you’re dropped in at the deep end and left to your own devices, which may be frustrating and alienating for those who find themselves pulverised against a rock for the third attempt in a row. Even the safety net of the rewind button--a feature once popularised by Codemasters’ own Grid--is absent here, ensuring even the slightest of mistakes are punished. It’s certainly unforgiving in its pursuit of authenticity, and the steep learning curve may turn some away. Stick with it, however, and this striking difficulty only makes it all the more rewarding once you do finally get to grips with everything Dirt Rally has to offer.With a phenomenal new physics engine, everything from your chosen vehicle (be it four-wheel, front-wheel or rear-wheel drive) to the type of driving surface, weather, time of day, and altitude all play a crucial role in how you approach each stage. You might excel on the gravel surfaces of Greece’s sun-swept wilderness, but you also might find yourself in a clump when negotiating Monaco’s icy tarmac roads. It’s just as likely you’ll hone your skills with the relatively meagre Mini Cooper S, before upgrading to a Audi Sport Quattro Rally that will knock your socks off with its weight and power.Taming these frightful four-wheeled beasts is perhaps Dirt Rally’s greatest challenge, and its most thrilling. Each of the 39 cars available are tight, responsive, and weighty in their own way; the fleet-footed antiques of the 1960s force you to maintain speed and momentum through modest corners, whereas the same approach in a potent modern car would send you careening down the nearest hillside. There’s a perpetual feeling that you’re barely in control, balanced on a knife’s edge as you struggle just to keep these unstable rockets on the road. It demands your constant input, forcing you to wrestle with an antagonistic wheel, constantly adjust the throttle, and pay close attention to the hazardous road ahead.All of this leads to a tangible sense of progression when you do finally master your chosen vehicle. When your apprehension and timidness is replaced by confidence and aggression, as corners you used to take slowly and steadily are now blitzed through with little afterthought. You start braking later, and turning in harder as you learn to shift the weight of your vehicle in anticipation of troublesome corners; hitting straights with more power than you ever would have before, and adapting to the ever-changing surface of the road with the verve of a seasoned vet. It’s a fantastic feeling.Though that’s not to say you’re ever really safe in Dirt Rally. Even if you’ve honed the intricacies of your Ford Focus RS WRC, there are still dangers lurking. Trepidation comes with every new corner, and with not knowing what’s ahead of you beyond your co-driver’s (excellent) guidance. Sure, this dissipates somewhat the more you play and begin to learn the stages, but Dirt Rally does a good job of varying the familiar with changes to weather and time of day, both of which affect how stages handle from one run to the next. When a blizzard rolls through Sweden, your task becomes exceedingly more difficult as you contend with the extremely limited visibility conjured by a flurry of snowfall. Just as smashing your headlights on a night stage presents you with the daunting prospect of navigating a stage you can barely see.In the career mode you’ll run the full gamut of counties and stages as you spend the majority of your time engaged in rally championships. These are lengthy multi-stage events, where damage is a persistent threat that must be managed with a crew of engineers, and a single wreck can end an entire championship even if you’re six stages deep. It’s here where the “retry” prompt becomes Dirt Rally’s safety net; a crutch I used in my first few hours with the game to erase my mistakes and right my many wrongs. If I crashed, it was no big deal. I’d gladly take the negligible monetary loss from my in-game winnings and start the stage over again.The more I played, however, the more I realised how detrimental this approach is to the whole experience. Without the fear of failure gnawing at my back, I was too careless because the consequences were marginal. I wasn’t becoming a better driver simply because I could afford to be sloppy. So I made the decision to commit to playing without restarting. Stubbornly forging ahead to the next championship even if I failed to finish the last.With catastrophe lurking behind every quiver of the wheel, this forced me to be focused and unwavering in my concentration. With zero margin for error, those moments when I was skirting the edge of disaster were terrifying. One wrong move in the latter stages of a finely balanced championship could send an hour’s worth of progress plummeting down the side of a mountain along with my precious ride. It was absolutely riveting, and the closest Dirt Rally comes to capturing the essence of its chosen motorsport, revelling in that mixture of terror, breakneck excitement, and the eventual jubilation when you emerge out the other side. That’s what Dirt Rally is all about.There are problems with the career mode’s structure, and how you have to do a little too much grinding in order to earn enough cash to buy new cars and subsequently enter more championships--which is all rather limiting. A progression system similar to Project CARS’ driver-for-hire approach would have been a better fit. And the other two modes--Hill Climb and Rallycross--also feel half-baked. Completing Colorado’s famous Pike’s Peak hill climb is a fantastic challenge, and Rallycross offers a lively aside, whether you’re competing against the aggressive AI or jumping online to smash chassis with other players (in what is Dirt Rally’s only offering of head-to-head multiplayer). But with five courses split between the two modes (two of which being different variations on Pike’s Peak), there’s not a whole lot here to sink your teeth into.Yet when you’re scampering through the lush greenery of a German field, skirting between the devious placement of two hay bales on what would otherwise be a simple straight, all of these issues fall to the back of your mind. Dirt Rally’s mechanics are so robust, and so accomplished in their execution, that it’s difficult to care about a lack of polish in its presentation, or a couple of skimpy game modes. This is as authentic a portrayal of rally as you’re likely to find, and proves to be not just a return to form for Codemasters, but its best game to date. Just don’t expect it to treat you with any courtesy."
774,Just Cause 4,6.0,1,"What's another oppressive dictatorship to series protagonist Rico Rodriguez? Not much. He does encounter a new kind of enemy in Just Cause 4, however: extreme weather. It's the common thread that runs through both the story and new mechanics and tops off the explosive spectacle the series is known for. And alongside new gadgets to send objects (and people) flying across the world, Just Cause has become a physics playground. Unfortunately, there just aren't enough opportunities to put these features to good use; underwhelming mission structure and a world slim on enticing activities makes Just Cause 4 a short-lived blast with untapped potential.The best and most prevalent piece of Just Cause games is at the forefront once again. An exceptional traversal system lets you propel Rico across the beautiful landscapes of Solis and effortlessly soar through the skies. With the combo of a grappling hook, parachute, and wingsuit, Rico can basically go wherever, whenever (and often more efficiently) without a vehicle. Like past games, you build momentum and essentially catapult yourself using the combination of these tools and hardly ever have to touch the ground. It's tough to overstate how satisfying it is to escape enemy hordes and hook onto the underside of a helicopter to hijack it and tear them all down, or slingshot yourself out of harm's way toward the next target you'll blow to bits.Rico isn't only built to move fast, however: if you aren't causing explosions on a regular basis, you might be doing something wrong. Fuel tanks, red barrels, and vehicles are unusually explosive, and set the stage for over-the-top action. Since the grappling hook can also be used to tether objects together, you have lots of opportunities to get creative outside of exhausting your arsenal of firearms--some of which have their own wacky practical applications, like the wind cannon or lightning gun. Some weapons just wreak havoc such as the railgun or burst-fire rocket launcher, and even modest small arms like the SMG have impactful alternate fire modes. This may be the expectation for Just Cause, but it still pulls you in for a wild ride.It's tough to overstate how satisfying it is to escape enemy hordes and hook onto the underside of a helicopter to hijack it and tear them all down, or slingshot yourself out of harm's way toward the next target you'll blow to bits.Its identity as a destructive playground is further emphasized by grappling hook mods, three of which you customize: air lifter, retractor, and boosters. All three devices coincide with the new physics engine. Air lifters (essentially mini hot air balloons) let you launch things into the sky, and they can be further customized in terms of velocity, behavior, and altitude. Retractors pull targets together violently, and boosters work like jet engines that'll send objects into a speeding frenzy, whether it be an attack helicopter or a poor enemy soldier. Multiple permutations of these contraptions are made possible, since their effects can be stacked into a single tether and three loadout settings let you switch between loadouts on the fly. These gadgets are unlocked through side activities, and you're given plenty of avenues to make them work as you desire, which leads to the most disappointing part. Just Cause 4 gives you so many shiny new toys to play with but seldom a reason to use them.Mission structure is uninspired, as you are continually asked to escort NPCs, defend a specific object for a set duration, activate (or destroy) inconspicuous generators, or hit a number of console panels to activate some sort of process. The worst offender has to be the timed missions that ask you to sink bomb-rigged vehicles into the ocean; they're tedious and prone to mishaps at no fault of your own. These are tied to Region Strikes, which are required to unlock territories on the map and progress to main story missions. While blasting through waves of enemies and their military-grade vehicles offers some great moments, you're often asking yourself: okay, what else? Shielded heavies, snipers perched from a mile away, and flocks of attack helicopters can become enjoyably overwhelming, since you have to rapidly make use of your diverse toolset. But several missions are designed in such a way that's oddly restricting, limiting the game's strongest assets. Enemies simply swarm and act as basic obstacles rather than clever challenges, and that leaves you with objectives that rarely bring out the best in the mechanics and systems of Just Cause 4.At a time when open-world games sometimes overstay their welcome, Just Cause 4 is at the other end of the spectrum, where you wish there was more to experience because it has so much going for it.There are a few stellar moments in the main story missions that make proper use of the extreme weather system that is the core of Just Cause 4's premise. Specifically, the conclusion to a stormchaser-themed questline funnels you through a number of battles while a tornado rips through your surroundings. Your ability to parachute and glide are drastically affected by the wind velocity and turbulence, which throws some welcome unpredictability into the mix. One particular sequence is also indicative of what the grappling hook mods are capable of; destroying massive wind cannons that impede progress with boosters wasn't only the most efficient method, but watching these heaps of steel frantically spin out of control was a sight to behold. The last stand in this mission, a sequence of rooftop firefights amid the harsh weather, brings the many great pieces of the game together.The same can't be said about the other extreme weather conditions, however. Sandstorms challenge you with violent winds and obscured vision, and thunderstorms bring torrential rain and lightning strikes that make for a visual treat. But they're not game-changing in the way tornadoes are since they have a minimal effect on gameplay. Even then, the questlines tied to these weather conditions and their respective biomes are over before you get to fully experience their unique qualities.All the while, a vaguely coherent story about family and a rebellion against an evil regime serves as the platform for Rico's wild ride. Stories in Just Cause haven't been more than excuses for environmental destruction and a way to make you feel comically powerful, and the same holds true here, though you may find the ties to previous entries somewhat endearing. The harsh forecasts are justified by villain Oscar Espinoza's high-tech devices that control the weather and oppress the people of the fictional South American country Solis. Rico remains the plausible one-man army who has the capabilities of a superhero with the air of a grounded, unassuming protagonist. If there's anything that Just Cause does well story-wise, it's convincing you to accept the absurdity of it all.Throughout the game, you'll be building a revolution across Solis, bolstering what's called the Army of Chaos. It's a fundamental piece to progression and the key to taking down Espinoza and toppling The Black Hand private military again. The Army of Chaos serves as a tool to controlling territories across the map since you need to accumulate squad reinforcements to overtake regions, which also gates your ability to take on story missions. Cause destruction and raise your chaos level, and get squads to progress. It boils down to a numbers game, and once you understand the structure of this system, you can easily snowball squad numbers and control all of Solis without having to grind your chaos level. Side activities from three minor characters litter the map as well; Sargento has you teaming with NPCs to destroy enemy infrastructure, Garland makes you do stunts, and Javi provides a bit more context to Solis by asking to do a few easy puzzles. It's more things to do, and they unlock the aforementioned grappling hook mods, but they're simple in nature and aren't enough to compensate for the shortcomings of other missions.Just Cause 4 has incredible moments where beauty and destruction cross with Rico's ability to zip around the world at a moment's notice. It's gratifying and easy to grasp, especially when you're able to string a series of wingsuit fly-bys, vehicles hijackings, and fiery explosions all in the name of revolution, but those moments are either short-lived or tied to rudimentary missions. You're given an awesome toolset that paves the way for creativity in a world with too few problems to solve. At a time when open-world games sometimes overstay their welcome, Just Cause 4 is at the other end of the spectrum, where you wish there was more to experience because it has so much going for it."
948,Bravo Team,4.0,0,"Well into 2018, we are past the point where VR is a new and novel experiment. Had Supermassive Games' Bravo Team released when the PSVR launched, we could at least excuse the game's milquetoast nature as a first, uncertain step; an experiment in trying to bring arcadey, cover-based shooting to a new format. Released two years into the PSVR's lifespan, however, Bravo Team already comes off as archaic, a game that's been outclassed several times over in the system's first year.Bravo Team's banality is obvious during its opening minutes. You and your online co-op partner or A.I. brother-in-arms are charged with escorting the president of a made-up eastern European country back home to deliver a unifying speech that will hopefully bring peace to her nation. Of course it goes wrong; the president's envoy gets blown to bits, and a deposed military leader kickstarts a bloody coup d'etat that you and your partner must shoot your way through in order to get home. The mission plays out with stone-faced seriousness, with the monotony of our two masked heroes broken up only by the determined British timbre of your commanding officer. There isn't even a musical score to accentuate the action, so even the most dramatic moments happen in an uncaring void.The set up might be indistinguishable from Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, or any number of grim, washed-out shooters, but, really, Bravo Team's gameplay has more in common with games like Time Crisis. Most of your time is spent hiding behind cover, popping out to line up your shots and fire. You can play with the DualShock 4 or the Move controllers (and this is even one of the few times where movement feels natural with the latter). However, the PS Aim gun controller is where it's at in that regard, and what thrills do exist in the game come from the inherent thrill of the Aim lending a dose of immersion.You also get a little bit more freedom to move than in a game like Time Crisis. You can point your gun or just tilt the PSVR headset at a certain area and you'll get a visual prompt telling you whether you can move there or not. The flaw here being that actual movement takes the game out of first person into a third-person view that rips that immersion away every single time.The presentation, with its dull, anemic color schemes straight out of 2007 and a rampant, unfathomable problem with pop-in and blurry textures, is the most prominent flaw. The same three classes of enemies you encounter in the first stage--generic grunt, armored grunt, armored grunt with chaingun--are the same ones you see every step of the way. The last half hour or so introduces two sections with melee soldiers and snipers, but they're gone almost as soon as they enter the scene. There's only four guns--a pistol, an assault rifle, a shotgun, and a sniper rifle--and you only see two of those in the last 30 minutes as well.Seemingly in an effort to break up the straightforward gunplay, stealth kills are possible. But outside of the tutorial, it's impossible to maintain stealth for more than two or three enemies before, without fail, another enemy stands at an angle where he can't be stealth killed. It doesn't help that your supposedly silenced pistol gives away your position 75% of the time. The most fun in Bravo Team comes from its online co-op, where at least you have a partner to bounce dialogue off of, give directions to, or request recovery when you've fallen. It's a salve, albeit a temporary one.Instead, Bravo Team slogs on, stranding you in huge spaces, throwing wave after wave of cannon fodder your way, making its short play time feel hours longer that it actually is. Bravo Team is a game that feels unsure and tentative about ideas that have been tried and tested for years now, even in VR."
3085,The First Templar,7.0,2,"             It's a shame that variety doesn't extend to your armaments. You unlock a handful of new weapons throughout the course of the game, but they don't have stat modifiers, so you have only slight visual differences to look forward to. The same rules apply to your armor. Each character has a few different outfits to unlock, but the only thing that changes is your outward appearance. It's disheartening that there aren't lots of items to hunt for because the sprawling levels urge you to explore every branching path you come across. There are hidden treasure chests (that usually contain attribute buffs) and bonus objectives in every area, and figuring out how to scour every inch of the level provides its own rewards, even if the tangible offerings aren't up to snuff. Most places can be discovered by straying from the most obvious path, but there's one investigative tool that is as useful as it is silly. In certain places, you can push a survey button that causes footprints to appear on the ground. Following glowing white shoe prints makes it feel like you're hunting down Casper the Friendly Ghost, and it's hard not to laugh when these prints appear even in a murky swamp. Exploration is a strong point in The First Templar that makes even slow moments engaging.    "
759,YIIK: A Postmodern RPG,5.0,1,"Postmodern"" is both an intriguing and an intimidating word. YIIK, pronounced ""Y2K,"" comes with the subtitle, ""A Postmodern RPG,"" but what does that mean? Is it a game centred around the tennis matches of Infinite Jest? Or around Andy Warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans? Regardless of the intention behind labeling the game as such, the postmodern tag initially seems a little peculiar.However, when you boot up YIIK you're met with a stylish title screen that looks like it was ripped straight out of a retro arcade. The stunning visuals are accompanied by an electro-jazz bass-driven track that immediately asserts the game's homage to '90s pop culture. After a short exchange with a crow named Marlene, you're given control of Alex McHugh, college graduate and spoiled brat. You're also unemployed and spend your time wandering around your town aimlessly until you meet a cat with a Salvador Dali moustache. Shortly afterwards, an ethereal girl goes missing, triggering a chain of events that threaten the very fabric of reality itself.YIIK plays as a turn-based RPG, but instead of a strength/weakness mechanic that's usually innate to most turn-based systems, YIIK uses a series of minigames to determine how much damage you deal and receive. Alex's basic attack sees him spin his favorite LP on a portable record player, which is lighthearted and amusing at first. However, as more characters and abilities are introduced to the game, the amount of minigames becomes increasingly more daunting.Basic attacks become ineffective as the game progresses, leaving you to use special abilities that feature minigames spanning myriad genres. These special abilities are necessary to take down mid-game enemies, but because there are no instructions on how to play the minigames, the game's learning curve is both unfair and unsatisfying. Make a mistake and you'll deal no damage, so you'll likely need to die a few times before you get the hang of a new ability. There's a voice that narrates the battle dynamics when you dodge an attack or die that sounds like the aliens from The Simpsons, though, which is a small redeeming factor.The defense mechanics aren't much better. Sometimes you can dodge if you nail a real-time prompt, whereas other times the most you can do is reduce the amount of damage you receive. One particular kind of attack, for example, targets your entire party of four and hits you like a truck unless you nail three timed prompts in quick succession, which is a lot more difficult to do than it might seem. Since this attack is used more frequently over time, it becomes a frustrating way to engage with combat. The battle pace is slow and the response to your inputs is clunky, making the battles themselves last for an unnecessarily long time. And the further you progress through the game, the more often you have to battle while traversing its many dungeons. Also, the real-time battle prompts are much better suited to a precise mouse-click than a button press, which is an issue on PS4.The game's leveling system, meanwhile, is tied to the Mind Dungeon, which sounds a lot more intriguing than it actually is. Again, the Mind Dungeon gets maximum style points, quite literally being a dungeon located in the protagonist's head that's accessed by dialing a specific number. In the Mind Dungeon, the camera angle changes to a side-scrolling perspective. In order to level up, you need to select one of four doors on the current floor and choose one of six skills to increase. You then need to enter the room behind that door, which confirms the skill increase. All four doors can be used to increase a skill, meaning that you can increase four skills for every level. After all four doors have been used, you can speak to Marlene the crow at the staircase located on the opposite side to the side you entered on. After confirming the level up, you descend to the next floor, which has another four doors -- and so on.The actual world of YIIK is stunning, though. Each map (apart from the dreary and awkwardly angled Wind Town) is designed with a gorgeous retro art style that screams '90s Nintendo, and the soundtrack is consistently killer. Hearing that Undertale developer Toby Fox helped with music production wasn't surprising at all, and the late-game vocal tracks in particular set the mood brilliantly. The art style and music set a ‘90s mood that's paired with a lighthearted tone, with the game being genuinely funny for the most part. One particular NPC unleashes a barrage of rubbish jokes, the last of which is, ""Are you visiting from Seattle? Say hi to Nirvana for me."" It's very silly, but it works in the game's favor.However, YIIK's attempts at humor can also be very problematic. Characters call each other ""spazoids,"" derived from the highly-insulting term ""spastic,"" as a throwaway insult. At one point Alex even says, ""That's our word"" about the word ""ginger."" On another occasion, a character says, ""You guys went into an epileptic fit,"" despite the fact that what actually happens doesn’t even remotely resemble that. These jokes don't land, instead creating an uncomfortable atmosphere. It's one thing to set your game in 1999 and use otherwise outdated terms in context, but it's another thing entirely to gratuitously use derogatory terms for comedic effect. The art style and characters already capture the era perfectly; drawing on the negative parts of the '90s for no reason doesn't add anything.YIIK has a number of design and technical performance issues as well. The game doesn't perform very well on console for a range of reasons. For one thing, the movement mechanics are a real issue on console. With no invisible barriers, traversing narrow bridges from an isometric perspective with a PS4 controller's analog sticks usually results in falling off the side. Obviously pressing the D key on a keyboard will cause you to move right with precision, but the same can't be said of analog sticks unless you're willing to move at a snail's pace through a game that's already slow.I also encountered a game-breaking bug that could only be resolved by going back three hours to an old save file.Although some aspects of the game can be called postmodern, YIIK tries a bit too hard to make itself smart, coming off as pretentious more often than notIn general, puzzles that are not complicated ended up being unnecessarily time-consuming. The puzzles in the early parts of the game are quick logic problems that are enjoyable and fit the style of the game like a glove. The later puzzles, however, are resolved with much more arbitrary solutions and, in my experience, are susceptible to bugs. For example, you are taught early in the game that one tool (Panda) is used to hold down pressure plates, while another tool (Dali) is used to activate inaccessible switches. Late in the game, you need to use Dali to activate a pressure plate while Panda is already in use elsewhere. However, you've been explicitly taught that each of the two has a role of its own--it's a bit cheap, really, and when I figured it out I felt dissatisfied, because it didn't fall in line with the logic that the game went out of its way to establish earlier. The solution was neither a clever implementation of the game's established rules nor a smart twist on those same rules.Although some aspects of the game can be called postmodern--namely the character arcs and the writing--YIIK tries a bit too hard to make itself seem smart, and it instead comes off as pretentious. By self-consciously addressing itself as a game and including lines like, ""How can an RPG be postmodern?"", YIIK is postmodern in a basic sense, featuring nods to the critique of Enlightenment ideas of self-realization. However, it doesn't use this basis to communicate anything important later on. It never builds on its foundations. YIIK's reliance on the quirkiness of its content--such as Alex attacking enemies with a record player--means that it's not postmodern so much as it is a take on hipster culture.YIIK opts for pointless ""postmodern"" jargon about the nature of objective reality and a person's soul over meaningful character development and ambitious experimentation with its form. On top of this, postmodern literary phrases are rattled off in contexts that are completely detached from their meaning, which can be perceived as postmodern in an edgy sense but definitely not an intriguing or challenging one.YIIK's characters are intriguing at first, but they don't really develop until late in the story, so it's difficult to care about them. At the end of the game, Alex provides a summary of what has happened, and it's genuinely interesting. It's unfortunate that the game managed to kill that intrigue with its slow, tedious, and clunky gameplay. There are two endings, both of which are canon. The one I got is the one that most people will get on their first playthrough, and it's not good. The story doesn't resolve itself in any meaningful way and the last boss is designed as another arbitrary puzzle that's a bit much to be considered clever or fair. Also, the route to the end of the game involves a monotonous grind that feels like not enough butter scraped over too much bread.Despite YIIK's stunning art direction, kicking soundtrack, and occasionally interesting plot point, it suffers as a result of its clunky combat, tedious grinding, and poor puzzle design. Postmodern texts aren't always enjoyable--Wallace's Infinite Jest features walls of text that list every chemical name for prescription drugs under the sun, spanning pages upon pages at a time. However, Infinite Jest has substance. For the most part, YIIK doesn't."
2207,Blue Estate,3.0,0,"   Blue Estate Prologue sets a snarky tone straight off, with hypernerd cliche (and private investigator) Roy Devine Jr. telling the story of the exotic Cherry Popz, who, we're told, has a deep aching void that only a good private dick can fill. Oh--it's also a stinky void, as if we weren't learning enough about the slinky stripper. Roy's nasal narration provides Blue Estate's main framing device, and is accompanied by fantastic artwork. One early scene portrays Cherry in silhouette, grinding against her pole beneath a single bright spotlight. In the foreground are disembodied images of all manner of firearms--and a single plate of spaghetti and meatballs. It's a powerful and suggestive image, and it's too good for the game and story it's a part of. You wouldn't expect the mobster you play to be classy, but the dialogue is aggressively mean-spirited from the moment you enter the strip club that plays home to your shootouts. To the Asian trio that greets you: ""Are your ears crooked, too?"" While shooting the club's endless guardians: ""It's like they built mooks into the walls!"" And then you meet Cherry Popz' replacement, Bertha Kowalski, whose voluptuous figure provokes Blue Estate's endless fat jokes. ""I guess the sequel's gonna be The Big Mermaid,"" says player-character Tony, referring to Bertha's mermaid costume and the giant aquarium she sits upon.  Once she loses her balance and falls into the massive tank (because fat women are funny!), Tony goes out of his way to let her flounder within. When he takes mercy on her and shoots her out of her predicament, she tries to flop to safety, still clad in her mermaid attire, which allows Tony to make more jokes at her expense. These cynical displays of non-humor are what I will remember Blue Estate for, as opposed to its bog-standard on-rails action.   "
401,Sam &amp; Max: Save the World,7.0,2,"Nostalgia is a funny thing. When the first episode of Telltale Games' Sam &amp; Max Save the World debuted in 2006, fans of 1993's Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road had waited years for the dog and bunny's return. Now, Save the World is old enough to have built up its own nostalgic fanbase, keen to once again revisit these lovable weirdos. Sam &amp; Max Save the World Remastered isn't a new game, but the huge visual and mechanical improvements implemented by developer Skunkape Games (a team made up of ex-Telltale folks) make it a pleasure to revisit.For the uninitiated, Sam &amp; Max Save the World Remastered is about two freelance police agents: Sam, a loquacious, wry dog who acts as de facto leader of the duo, and Max, his psychotic rabbit pal. Across the six episodes included in this remaster, the pair gets caught up in a mass-hypnosis scheme, thwarting various enemies on their way to finally facing the season's big bad during the finale. While Telltale would eventually become known for its choice-focused narrative experiences like The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, Sam &amp; Max Save the World is a far more traditional point-and-click adventure game--you talk to people, gather items, and then use those items in clever ways to progress through the story.Each episode of Save the World follows roughly the same pattern: Sam and Max get a call about a new case in the opening cutscene, and they head out to start asking questions. Each episode is compact, running about two hours and featuring, at most, three locations. Over time, recurring themes and characters emerge, and before long the pair realize that there's some nefarious connective tissue running throughout all of their cases.The plot doesn't take itself particularly seriously, which is a good thing, because the overarching story is a bit of a dud. While some side characters are fun (a chicken actor; a nearby neighbor who changes her job every episode; a giant living statue of Abraham Lincoln), many of the recurring characters are more annoying than amusing. There are only so many times you can talk to a squeaky-voiced child star whose gimmick is that he pees too often before you get tired of him. There are some fun individual moments and plenty of great scenes throughout the game, but most of the good jokes are saved for Sam and Max themselves.The two heroes are a delight. Sam and Max's conversations are a mix of bon mots, puns, and allusions to wild adventures. It's easy to grow attached to Max's irreverent love of violence and Sam's unerring devotion to his little buddy, and the game's script is peppered with fun Easter eggs, meta comments, and absurdist jokes. Both characters are consistently amusing throughout the adventure.The game's puzzles are, for the most part, enjoyable and clever. They tend to come in groups; once or twice an episode you'll be given three tasks to complete, all interconnecting in smart ways. The key is to remember that you're playing a comedy game that follows comedy rules--and many of the solutions end up being pretty funny. Logical leaps are rare in the front half of the game, and while the back half has a few circuitous solutions, there's nothing too obscure or ridiculous. While it won't give your brain a full workout, there's enough here to make you feel smart.This remastered version of the game has been updated with widescreen display, controller support, uncompressed audio, and drastically overhauled visuals. Sam &amp; Max Save the World wasn't a looker by 2006 standards, but it's now gorgeous, with reworked character models and a lighting system that adds a huge amount of depth and personality to the experience. Despite these major upgrades, the original art remains largely intact, and has been polished rather than replaced. Chintzy décor and ugly fonts abound, and you wouldn't want it any other way--the game's look and vibe are still unique all these years later. There's some subtle cel-shading to give characters a more cartoony look, which suits the overall tone perfectly. This is a significant upgrade and an enormous improvement over the flat graphics of the original release. It looks fantastic on Switch, too, although it can look slightly fuzzy in handheld mode.You're now in direct control of Sam, rather than guiding him around with a pointer (as was the case in the original release), and it feels much more natural than before. The ability to highlight every object you can interact with by tapping the L button cuts down on frustrating pixel-hunting, and the controls have been streamlined to make this feel like a game built specifically with a controller in mind. You can also play with the touch screen on Switch, if that's your preference. Clicking and dragging to control Sam is functional, but I switched back to the Joy-Con almost immediately--still, it's a good option to have.The game runs beautifully, which is a blessing for anyone who played the original release on Wii or Xbox 360. Load times are short and frame rates are stable, with no hitches or stuttering across the entire six-episode series. All of these changes are very welcome--it's enough to make you wish that Skunkape could go back and touch up all of Telltale's old games.The development team has also changed a few camera angles, added new songs, and even changed the timing on some jokes. Bosco, the local convenience store owner and a major side character, has been re-recorded--he's a Black man who was previously voiced by a white actor, which has thankfully been rectified--but otherwise the dialogue is unchanged, for better or worse. While the game is mostly funny, some jokes have aged more poorly than others. At times, the game can punch down or lean on stereotypes for the sake of a gag, and while they're never outright hateful, these lazier jokes don't sit well next to the game's more effective absurdist humor. The fact that you're playing as two gun-toting, trigger-happy cops hits differently now, too, although the characters and situations are all strange and exaggerated enough that it's easy to disconnect from reality while playing.In other areas, the game's advancing age can be kind of charming. The fact that there are jokes about Keanu Reeves being a bad actor certainly date the game, as does the chapter where Max faces off against the US president, presented as a robotic hayseed satire of George W. Bush who is threatening to introduce, among other things, mandatory gun registration. One chapter takes place inside a virtual reality version of the internet; seeing a pastiche of the web that contains no references to social media feels very strange, because things have changed so much over the years. These jokes date the game, but they also give it a keen sense of time and place: the heart of the original game is mostly untouched.Sam &amp; Max Save the World Remastered is more than just a nostalgia play. The season has held up well and still has plenty of great jokes and clever puzzles that have held up well over time. Even if the overarching plot is weak, and some jokes don't hit, the titular duo is still a delight, and the smart puzzles are even more enjoyable to solve now that the controls have been improved. This is the definitive version of one of Telltale's strong early efforts--hopefully Sam &amp; Max Seasons 2 and 3 will receive similar treatment in the future."
1078,Uncharted: The Lost Legacy,9.0,2,"Team chemistry abounds in Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, which is not surprising for a side story to a series famous for its AI-partner-driven gameplay. A decade's worth of adventures and a conclusive epilogue might place franchise mainstay Nathan Drake on permanent retirement, so now is as fitting a moment as any to wander and fight through a new Uncharted from a fresh perspective. With a roster of characters as large as Uncharted's, developer Naughty Dog had a wealth of promising pairings to choose from. After playing through The Lost Legacy, it's hard to imagine a better Drake-less pairing than the treasure hunter Chloe Frazer and ex-mercenary Nadine Ross. Not only do they prove themselves as capable adventurers, but also entertaining ones with the kind of chemistry that doesn't rely on Nathan Drake-inspired wisecracks.The duo's vastly different backgrounds and motivations create a dynamic ripe for a classic apprehensive alliance and the tensions that come with it. Seeking an artifact called the Tusk of Ganesh in the Western Ghats of India, the pair find themselves racing against Asav, a perpetually angry warlord who places highly in the Uncharted villain ruthlessness power rankings. It's also a quest rich in exposition and substance, with lot of credit given to the well-written banter between Chloe and Nadine. Not only is it engaging to hear them bring down their emotional barriers of mistrust, but the small talk helps fill in the blanks since the events of Uncharted 4. Moveover, the dialogue eventually reveals the meaning of the game's subtitle, which shines a light on Chloe's personal drive to find the tusk. Just the fact that her history differs from Nathan Drake's opens the door for new insights on recurring Uncharted themes, namely the dangers of ambition and the relationships that can suffer as a result. These are messages that adventure genre fans can appreciate even without a connection to the series' past.The dense vegetation of India and its peppering of ruins reflect Naughty Dog's amusingly consistent attachment to jungles in Uncharted. In The Lost Legacy, the studio doubles down on tropical forests with striking results. The lush surroundings and detailed remains of ancient civilizations are fitting trivia-laden conversation starters for Chloe and Nadine. And despite that The Lost Legacy is shorter than even the first Uncharted--six hours compared to eight--these insightful archeological chats about Hindu mythology don't feel forced or rushed.Such refined moments are indicative of The Lost Legacy's impressive conciseness, packing a ton of Uncharted history in its moment-to-moment experiences. For those new to Uncharted, that translates to a lot of death-defying stunts any given minute. Moreover, the stealth tutorial is fittingly brief, chase sequences are consistently riveting, and climbing sections never feel drawn out. All the while there's an ebb and flow to both the pacing of the narrative and how gameplay sections are spread out. In other words, for every instance of high intensity, there's a well-placed opportunity to take a breather.The jungles also provide the ideal setting for Naughty Dog to expand and refine its open, free-roaming designs previously seen in the much praised Madagascar map of A Thief's End. This new open map--which is the setting of two of The Lost Legacy's chapters--demands a lot of driving, but going over your own beaten paths doesn't feels like a chore. This is thanks to the wealth of timeworn man-made remains worth exploring and--more often than not--climbing. While you're challenged with navigating up these structures, thoughtful level design ensures the way down is an easy and quick descent. For a game that originated as a more modest expansion to Uncharted 4 with the projected size and scale of The Last of Us: Left Behind, this section alone illustrates why Chloe and Nadine's adventure warranted a larger production.Both expansive and confined areas prove memorable for the host of combat encounters that invite player ingenuity and improvisation. Many of The Lost Legacy's shootouts offer a wealth of emergent and new gunplay opportunities after every death and retry. It's not a mere race of exchanging gunfire; there are plenty of chances to outflank Asav's army by making use of columns and elevated platforms rather than fighting enemies head-on. It's a showcase of easily executable simple pleasures, like striking enemies from above and knocking out a soldier from around a corner.That's not to say there are no other ways to outwit these squads. Clearing a fully-staffed patrol with a dozen discreetly-thrown grenades with zero detection isn't only possible but also a satisfying rush. Playing as a ninja and triggering no alert states is even harder, but many of the combat areas are large and well-designed enough that such gratifying outcomes are possible. Just don't expect many--if any--opportunities to play the pacifist; the more linear levels require full sweeps and takedowns of whole crews.There’s never been a more even mix of puzzles, combat, and exploration in the Uncharted series than in The Lost Legacy. While the series has had its share of dry switch-activation chores disguised as puzzles, this game keeps such sections to a minimum. This new batch of quandaries will stump you long enough to make the feeling of solving them rewarding. And sinces these obstacles are visually themed on the Hindu gods that are the focus of the duo's quest, no prior Uncharted experience is necessary to solve these puzzles.Unfortunately, adequate time was not available to evaluate the game's multiplayer and wave-based Survival modes. As these are the exact game types of Uncharted 4's online component--that use the same servers no less--you can expect a level of chaotic gunplay and melee combat not found in The Lost Legacy's story mode. A contrast to the less aggressive enemies in the campaign, fighting against real-life players is a veritable free-for-all where you're using everything from rope swinging to RPGs to survive. The common supernatural powers found in sought-after artifacts, the motivation of earning gold to summon AI support soldiers, and a time-sucking progression system adds depth to what would've been an otherwise forgettable adversarial online mode.The Lost Legacy doesn't signify a new era for Uncharted so much as it presents an opportunity to show the series from new perspectives, for which Chloe and the AI-controlled Nadine are perfectly capable. With a new playable treasure hunter comes new settings and character motivations, wrapped in a comfortingly familiar Uncharted package. The thrill of playing through set pieces that call back scenes from the earlier games is all the more enhanced when seen through the gameplay mechanics introduced in A Thief's End. The initial hours of The Lost Legacy give an ""Uncharted Greatest Hits"" vibe, but it grows into a more nuanced, clever experience, ranking among the best in the series while also making its own mark as a standalone Uncharted that isn't anchored to Nathan Drake's harrowing exploits."
2773,Quarrel,8.0,2,"  Taking over the world through tactical force in the board game Risk is very different from dismantling your opponent through clever word usage in Scrabble, but what if these two seemingly disparate ideas could be combined into one game? Quarrel accomplishes that feat, and the result is a challenging Xbox Live game that proves to be addictive whether you're playing against fiendish computer opponents, dastardly friends, or cunning online strangers. Though Quarrel was originally released for the iOS last year, don't be fooled into thinking this a shallow mobile experience. Rather, with a few substantial tweaks and additions, Quarrel offers an experience that more than lives up to console-sized expectations.                   Despite its flaws, Quarrel offers a robust experience for puzzle enthusiasts and wordsmiths alike, and at a cost of just 400 Microsoft points ($5.00), you're sure to get your money's worth. It's a welcome relief from more standard fare and a good way to keep your gray matter in shape.   "
4445,Jam with the Band,4.0,0,"  UK REVIEW--Jam With the Band aims to be a one-stop-shop for music fans, combining traditional rhythm action with a music creation tool. Sadly it doesn't live up to its lofty goals and ultimately fails to make either an enjoyable experience. A simple one-button beginner mode lets newcomers get on board, but it soon becomes monotonous, requiring you to tackle  frustrating difficulty levels, which keep it from being fun.  The less musically inclined will find it difficult to get their head around the note layouts and studio tool, while the poor presentation gives it a dated look. If you have musical experience and a group of friends to play with, you may be able to squeeze some fun out of it, but there are far better rhythm games available for the DS.        You're introduced to Jam With the Band by the voluptuous Barbara the Bat, the owner of a low-rent rock club and shop. Since she's the owner, you have to impress her with your virtual playing skills when you take to the stage. Unfortunately, impressing her is either very dull or immensely difficult. The premise is simple enough: a marker scrolls from the left to the right of the screen in time with the music and passes over prompts corresponding to any of eight face buttons and triggers. You push the marked button at the correct time and are awarded a good, OK, bad, or miss rating, depending on how accurate your timing is. There are several difficulty levels to choose from, which vary the number of buttons you have to press. In beginner mode you have to push only a single button and keep rhythm. Its simplicity makes it accessible for beginners, but also very dull. After just a few songs you begin to suffer from the monotony of pushing a solitary button along to the music, and will want to move up to a higher difficulty level to keep things interesting. This means moving  up to amateur, where you use  four buttons; pro where you use eight; or master where you use all 10. However, changing the difficulty does not affect the speed of the note charts, which move far too fast. This makes it difficult to memorise the various button positions and match them up with the on-screen indicators, which whiz by at lightning speed, leaving your fingers to play catch up.     While it’s possible to become relatively comfortable with the A, B, Y, and Left button combination of amateur mode, in order to rack up some real points and progress through the career mode you need to move up to pro. The jump from four to eight buttons is massive, and co-ordinating them with the overly zealous note chart is a real challenge, particularly when multiple notes are played using the d-pad. Often multiple d-pad hits are placed in quick succession and interspersed with the face buttons, which combined with the speed at which the chart moves, makes it an exercise in frustration. This is exacerbated by the strange layout of the note chart, which is organised into one-bar sections. The marker moves from left to right across the bar and then jumps down the next one below. This means that longer notes that require you to hold a button down are cut across multiple bars, making it a real challenge to know when to let go and press the next button. There is a basic practice mode, which lets you slow down tracks by 50 percent. However, you still have the issue of notes cutting off across multiple bars, making even half-speed songs a chore.     There are 50 songs, and more are available to download for free via Wi-Fi. Strangely, once you've downloaded a song, you cannot remove it. You're limited to 50 slots, so you have to make sure you really want that copy of ""Uptown Girl"" before you fill the last one. The songs themselves are about as far removed from master tracks as you can get. Each one is played in general MIDI, with the vocals replaced by an instrument. This makes them sound incredibly cheesy and is akin to playing along to elevator Muzak. Worse still, the song lineup appears to have mixed the record collection of a teenybopper with that of her granddad. One moment you're playing along to Britney's ""Slave 4 U,"" the next it's followed by a rousing rendition of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 in MIDI strings. Not helping matters is the fact that the game often changes the ""theme"" of the song. For example, you may hear Blink 182's ""All the Small Things"" played with traditional Japanese instruments. However, nothing can prepare you for the painful aural onslaught that is a swing jazz version of ""Smoke on the Water,"" complete with recorders and saxophones. The themed versions of songs are awful, which makes the game's constant use of them incredibly irritating.        You have two options for playing songs: quick play and the career mode dubbed Today's Gig. The career mode is sparse, serving as nothing more than a glorified mixtape. You play gigs for Barbara the Bat in her basement venue. Playing well boosts your performance rank, rated in stars. The first two stars allow you to play the songs in beginner mode, and if you do well you advance to amateur mode once you reach three. In order to progress you must continue the process all the way up to 10 stars, where you are subjected to playing songs in the nigh-on-impossible master mode. Unfortunately you can't select your own difficulty level to player through the career mode, so the only way to advance is to tackle the harder difficulties. Each time you jump into the career mode, Barbara selects a theme for the day. If you're lucky, this could mean playing piano versions of songs, but if you're unlucky, you might be subjected to the aforementioned musical horror that is the jazz theme. After playing each song, you're given a score. A score of 85 or above increases your performance rank, 70 to 84 means it stays the same, and anything below 70 decreases it. If you perform well, you're given the chance to do an encore, where you have to play a song with a different theme. If you receive a low score, or if you quit during it, your performance rank decreases. Aside from receiving compliments from Barbara, there are no real incentives to play through the encores, or indeed any of the career mode. There are no rewards or unlockables to keep your interest.         It's much easier to simply choose the song you want to perform in quick play. In career mode, you play only the vocal melody part. Quick play lets you choose from a selection of eight instruments for each song, including drums, guitars, and bass. The high difficulty level on the higher modes saps much of the fun out of playing the instruments, while beginner mode relegates you to the dullness of tapping along with one button. You also have the option of singing along to songs in Barbara's karaoke club, using the DS's built-in microphone. Lyrics scroll across the screen in traditional karaoke fashion, and you're awarded points based on how well you sing. However, there's no visual feedback as to how well you're singing, making it difficult to know if you’re racking up any points. The lack of feedback makes this option dull, though a group of friends may get a kick out of it if they sing together. On your own, there's little incentive to play it, because like the other modes, you're not rewarded for a good performance.        Fortunately, there is some fun to be had in multiplayer, where up to eight people can get together for a jam session using a single cartridge via download play. The leader of the group picks a song, while the other band members choose an instrument to play. Rather than simply hearing a quieter version of an instrument when someone messes up, you hear an incorrect note or drum hit. Although this is realistic, it isn't very fun. The lack of a quiet backing track makes it more difficult to keep in time, particularly if you have an especially bad rhythm section. However, this does make you feel like you're really playing an instrument, rather than merely playing along, so when you do nail a song with friends, you get a great feeling of accomplishment. This is helped by the fact you can't fail out, regardless of difficulty level, so no matter how bad you're playing you can keep ploughing on till you're making sweet music together.     If you want a break from the rhythm game, then you can jump into the music creation suite, where you can create your own MIDI masterpieces using the basic or advanced studio. As its name implies, the basic studio is a very simple way to make songs. You can input notes by humming them into the microphone or by playing them on the keyboard. A click track lets you keep time, while a scrolling musical score keeps track of the notes. Neither method is great for making songs. Humming your tune in results in some awful creations because the game isn't accurate at identifying what notes you're singing. The keyboard input fares a little better but is restricted by the DS touch screen. Because it can sense only one touch at a time, you can't play in chords. You can also see only one octave at a time, and changing it requires you to push an onscreen button away from the keyboard, which interferes with your playing. Once you've played your notes, you can select from a range of premade backing tracks to set to it. The game automatically matches the backing track to what key your notes are in and changes it accordingly. Like all the other songs, the track is played in MIDI, so it doesn't sound great, but the game does a good job of matching your playing to the correct backing track key.     The advanced studio lets you program in notes directly using a musical score. You can pick up to eight instruments to play on each track and choose their sound from anything in the general MIDI library. The editing features are limited, but can be useful for jotting down ideas when out and about. To create a song you drag a note value from the top of the screen onto the score, building up your composition. You can copy and paste sections, and there is one stage of undo should you make a mistake. However, there is no way to loop a section and listen to it, so you constantly have to hit rewind and play while you're testing new ideas. You're also restricted to 120 bars of music, and there is no indication as to how long your song is in minutes on the editing screen. You can solo a track while you're listening to it, but only one track at time, so you can't see how well your bass line is mixing with the drums without listening to all the instruments at once. The final problem is that there is no way to change the volume of individual instruments, so you can't layer your instruments in the mix. As a simple tool for getting your spur-of-the-moment ideas down, the studio works. However, advanced users looking for more flexibility will be disappointed with the lack of features, while beginners will be perplexed by the musical score input. Sharing options for your music are also limited. You can upload your track to the central list of downloadable songs, but only if it is a cover of an existing composition, which must be matched up in the Compact Disc Database for identification. If you upload an original creation, it will not be approved.        Jam With the Band is a poor rhythm game. It's confusing and overly fast note chart layout makes it difficult to play, while the massive jump in difficulty between the amateur and pro modes means you'll have a hard time advancing through the lacklustre career mode.  The basic studio is too restrictive, the advanced studio lacks the power to make it anything more than a notepad, and the perplexing restrictions placed on music downloads and uploads only serve to annoy. The presentation also leaves a lot to be desired, with blocky graphics, poor animation, and garish colours plastered over every screen. While you can have fun playing the game with some friends, the dull single-button beginner mode and the dedication required to learn the complex controls on higher difficulty levels makes the boring single-player not worth the effort. Though it held promise, Jam With the Band is a prime example of how to make an inaccessible and boring game. There are plenty of good games in the rhythm genre on the DS, but this certainly isn't one of them.    "
3567,Disney/Pixar Finding Nemo (2003),5.0,1," Hundreds of movies involve a great search. Quest for Fire. Searching for Bobby Fischer. Sasquatch Odyssey: The Hunt for Bigfoot. Now Pixar, headed by Steve Jobs, the fearless pioneer who combined computers with wax fruit, has brought you yet another quest extravaganza.   In Finding Nemo, you're on a mission to locate your lost aquatic buddy. To do this, you must navigate a series of underwater levels, dodging blowfish, barracudas, your mother-in-law and other deep-sea horrors. Each level must be completed within a time limit.   You'll spend most of your time simply dodging the game's baddies, although it's possible to take them out using an Allen Iverson-inspired spin move. The number of times you can execute this maneuver is limited, but you can get more spins by picking up the corresponding power-up. Because the control is rather unresponsive, the usefulness of the spin move is limited. Often your character will fail to perform the move properly, costing you a life. The unreliability of your attack is the main source of the game's challenge.   Finding Nemo is adequate graphically, although its visuals are a bit repetitive. Levels look similar, except for the addition of new enemies to avoid. All the enemies are equally damaging, so the change between levels is a simple switching of sprites that doesn't affect the overall gameplay experience.   Simply put, the challenge provided by Finding Nemo's poorly implemented control will not be enough to hold the attention of most gamers. For fans of the film, the game might be worth the download; but most everyone else will be content to let Nemo stay lost. "
4853,Dino Master,2.0,0,"  Reading the text on the back of the game's box, you'd think Dino Master was poised to become the next Pokémon or Yu-Gi-Oh! You play through puzzle-based levels to collect fossils, which can later be put together to bring dinosaurs back to life. Those dinosaurs, then, can be pitted against other dinosaurs in the game's battle mode. It sure sounds like an awesome concept. Unfortunately, you only have to play the game for a few minutes to realize that it is totally the opposite of awesome. The controls are sluggish and unreliable, the battle mode is nothing more than a glorified rock-paper-scissors, and the graphical quality throughout ranges from outdated to downright ugly.        Dino Master consists of three interwoven play modes, called fossil hunt, laboratory, and battle. Of the three modes, fossil hunt is the most involved. Each of the more than 30 dig sites is a play area roughly two screens tall and two screens wide. To dig up the fossils and items that are shown, you use the stylus to drag an paleontologist around the play area. The paleontologist leaves behind colored lines as he moves. When you create a square or a rectangle, the area inside the shape is claimed and the items inside are automatically dug up. It works very much like the classic puzzle game, Qix, right down to the fluttering enemies that are constantly chasing the sprite, or, in this game's case, the goofy male paleontologist.     Once you try to steer the paleontologist out of the way of the first enemy you see, you'll notice right off that there's a problem with the controls. It's bad enough that he moves at a snail's pace and that you have to constantly drag the stylus to keep him moving. What's worse, though, is that the game will often point him in the direction opposite to where you've tapped, or just outright ignore your tapping. The fossil hunt mode is tough enough to play early on when there are only one or two enemies visible. On later levels, it's downright unplayable, thanks to the broken controls.     The other two play modes don't suffer from any control-related issues, but that's mainly because they're so limited that the controls don't really come into play. When you put together dinosaurs in the laboratory mode, all you can do is look at a two-dimensional drawing of the creature, check out some basic battle stats, and upgrade the dino's special techniques using the items you've already collected. As for the battle mode, it's a joke. Much like in a Pokémon battle, the enemy dino is shown on the upper screen and your dino is shown on the lower screen. Each dinosaur has multiple weak points. Using the stylus, you select the weak point on the other dinosaur that you will attack, and select the weak point on your own dinosaur that your will defend. Then, the pictures of the two dinosaurs shake a bit and damage is deducted. If you correctly guessed which spot to protect, you won't take any damage that turn. It's all based on luck. You can't even choose to make different attacks. Any special skills that you bought from the laboratory will happen automatically, and they usually won't have a significant influence on the outcome.     An equally minimal amount of effort was put into the game's overall presentation. On the whole, Dino Master looks and sounds like an early generation Game Boy Advance game. There are times, even, where the graphics and audio dip into 8-bit Game Boy Color territory. That's pretty shameful, considering that this is a Nintendo DS game released in the year 2006. Audio consists of some weakly synthesized music, a collection of thudding sound effects, and a couple of low-volume dinosaur roars. Graphical quality varies depending on the mode you play.         In the fossil hunt mode, most of the upper screen's real estate is taken up by a simple green and blue grid representing a status display of sorts. The lower screen shows a top-down view of the dig area. Backgrounds are colored in washed-out shades of green, blue, and brown, eerily reminiscent of the color schemes used by role-playing games on the old Game Boy Color. Richer colors are used to fill in the various fossils and enemies, although they're generally tiny and don't exhibit more than two frames of animation, when they animate at all. In the laboratory and battle modes, the screens are filled by large images of dinosaurs, which would be fine, if only the images weren't all cute drawings painted with a limited color palette. To make matters more unfortunate, dinos in the battle mode don't actually move or attack. Instead, their images just slide across the screen and shake in response to the commands you make.     They had a good idea with Dino Master. Unfortunately, the development team didn't manage to bring that idea to life in a fun manner, or even a playable one. There are plenty of puzzles to complete and roughly 100 dinosaurs to collect, and the battle mode even supports the requisite two-player linkup. None of those things matters, though, because the game as a whole is underdeveloped, broken, and ugly.    "
1019,Oure,5.0,1,"In Oure you play as a young boy or girl who, in the game's opening moments, is pushed through a glowing door of light and finds themselves suddenly able to transform into a long and slender dragon, one obviously inspired by Chinese mythology. This type of dragon is a traditional sign of prosperity, and the game implies throughout that the actions you take may be repairing a broken world. Of course. There's a personal cost--there usually is in this sort of narrative--but there's not much in the way of pathos in this plot.After a brief tutorial you're unleashed into an open expanse of clouds and invited to fly around the game's hub, following glowing markers to your next objective and collecting scattered blue orbs to progress. The dragon is simple to control, because there's not actually a lot it can do--you can climb up or dive down while flying through the air, and speed up if your stamina has recharged. The dragon is pleasantly zippy, and snaking through the skies at fast speeds is inherently satisfying. Gliding through the air, dipping into clouds, chasing orbs, and simply existing peacefully as the dragon is the most enjoyable part of the game. Unfortunately, the appeal of flying around wanes fairly quickly--the sky holds few surprises, and there's never a major change of pace or scenery. Wherever you go, it's just clouds as far as the eye can see, and the few collectables and additional pieces of lore you can scavenge aren't going to amount to anything significant beyond a few PlayStation Trophies. The novelty of flying around as a dragon wears thin because the game gives you little sense of purpose outside of your primary objective.Your ultimate goal is to tame eight Titans, and to do so you need to collect the aforementioned orbs (although you can finish the game having collected less than a quarter of them) and activate pillars scattered around the map. Doing so is as simple as flying to them and finding their nearby activation point, at which point a Titan sequence will kick off. Most of these encounters are over within a few minutes, and combined they don't add up to much. The Titans might be epic in scale but taking them down is either very simple or annoyingly fiddly, with the game never quite finding the right balance in between.The relaxing tone of flying through the clouds is at odds with these Titan sequences, and it's hard to identify a coherent link between the two parts of the game. The goal in each sequence is to grab every one of the glowing spires attached to a Titan, flying over them and figuring out the best way to approach the Titan's weak points. Each one requires a different method, but there's nothing here that feels particularly distinct--if you’ve played games with boss fights in them you'll be familiar with many of the approaches. After you grab a spire you'll have to solve a quick line-drawing puzzle, a la The Witness, to pull it out. Once all of them are pulled out the Titan will be tamed."
987,Batman: The Enemy Within - The Telltale Series,9.0,2,"What Ails You is a standout episode with strong writing, compelling performances, and decision-making moments that feel like they have significant consequences. The star is John, the would be Joker, who finally unravels, going from the well-meaning if a bit unhinged friend to something much closer to the Clown Prince of Crime we're used to seeing terrorize Gotham City and Batman. However, since developer Telltale has been building towards this from the very start, the shift is the culmination of a slow descent into madness instead of a leap, and it's fascinating to watch.It's not as simple as something within him snapping. Instead, this Joker has been forged by a maelstrom of emotions wearing him down. John has suffered internal conflicts between what he's destined to become and his desire to find true friendship; a destructive love for Harley Quinn and his reverence of Batman. And all of that comes through in the way he's written and performed in the episode. We get to see a vulnerable, misguided, lonely figure desperately trying to find something to anchor himself to--and whether Bruce and Batman are positive influences in that process is called into question.As Harley, Bane, and Freeze make a play for a deadly virus that could have devastating implications, Bruce realizes that the key to stopping them is John. In fact, many of the series' most high-stakes events have involved Bruce relying on John for help, and the realities of this give-and-take relationship are laid bare. While many Batman stories have tried, very few have succeeded in making the audience feel sympathy for Joker, but Telltale actually pulls it off, and it's a testament to how well it has humanized this larger-than-life supervillain that he feels relateable. There are moments that make you think about the way you've used John in the past, and whether you've been genuinely treating him as a friend or as just a tool to achieve objectives.In the midst of the self-reflection the episode inspires, the game asks you to choose whether to put your faith in John once more. However, it does this after presenting the most damning evidence that he may have finally flipped, with just John's word luring you into thinking that things may not be as clear cut as they seem. It's a powerful moment that offers fans of Batman something few other mediums can: the opportunity to give Joker a chance. Given that the series' decision-making moments ultimately always reconnect to a predetermined narrative, the overall outcome is set. However, the type of person John emerges as is one that your actions--past and present--have helped define.Episode 4 also muddies the relationship between Batman and Amanda Waller, whose unclear motives start to come into focus. As is typical of Waller, her actions become more dubious, and the consequences of them have fallout on those around her. While her cards aren't completely laid out on the table, her tells and bluffs start to become more transparent. By presenting her as someone who is both somewhat sketchy and under pressure to handle a situation spiraling out of control Telltale maintains an enigmatic air about her.What Ails You also lays the groundwork for future drama, revealing how recent happenings have impacted Alfred, and the responsibility Bruce now has to face for his decision to take Tiffany Fox, the daughter of his close ally Lucius Fox, under his wing. And it breaks up all these with sequences where Bruce investigates clues to push the narrative forward, or the odd set-piece in which Batman trades blows with villains. Like previous episodes, there's a dearth of moments that challenge the mind or offer engaging gameplay, but in a narrative and characterisation-heavy episode, these sequences provide some respite from the high-pressure interactions with other characters.Episode 4 of Telltale's Batman: The Enemy Within has top-notch writing, thoughtful depictions, and impactful decision-making moments. It leaves Bruce, Batman, and you to grapple with questions and uncertainty. Between the future of Joker, the nature of Amanda Waller, and the potential fallout of Bruce's mission on his allies, Telltale has set the stage for what could (better) be an explosive finale."
2640,Mario Tennis Open,6.0,1,"           Spicing up the tennis somewhat is the ""chance shot"" mechanic. During rallies, glowing circles appear on the court, corresponding to one of five shot types. Performing a shot on the colored circle causes you to perform a smash shot that can stagger your opponents, curve around them, or lob over their heads. It's not too over the top--the focus is on largely sensible tennis mechanics after all--but it's enough to give you an edge in rallies. During earlier tournaments, these chance shots basically function as win buttons, and you almost always score a point if you hit one. This is particularly exaggerated if using the gyro controls, as the game will direct your character right into the chance shot spot. As if that weren't easy enough, while you can press the correct shot button (yellow for lob, red for topspin, and so on), chance shots can also be activated by performing a simple shot, which leads the game to perform the correctly colored shot without your having to worry about complicated things like pressing the right button.            "
1793,Far Cry 4,7.0,2,"  Far Cry 3's narrative issues, but amplifies them until the story collapses into a pile of yee-haw hillbilly language, cliched tribalism, and weak political posturing. For a game primarily interested in providing a joyous first-person sandbox, Far Cry 4 is oddly adamant about choking you with its meager attempts to titillate. Like the Nepalese-esque environments it depicts, Far Cry 4 is all about highs and lows, suffocating you with poor storytelling before setting you free into the wilderness to create thrills of your own. And those thrills can be almost overwhelming, providing the kind of headrush that was Far Cry 3's calling card. It is you and a giant map dotted with activities, each one fun enough that you want to rush towards the waypoint to see what's in store there. Perhaps it's an outpost that need liberating from Min's army. You can force freedom upon it by sneaking around, stabbing baddies from behind and throwing knives into their comrades' foreheads in one smooth motion. But Far Cry 4's additions are tailored towards chaos, and it's difficult to escape their gravity. Throwing a simple slab of meat invites a tiger or a bear (or even a violent honey badger, a reference that would have been dated even a few years ago) to the bloody party. The creature isn't a familiar--it may turn on you once it's done feasting on Min's soldiers' meat--so there's only minor guilt in throwing a molotov cocktail into the mix and watching the flaming feline strike fear into your foes' hearts. Of course, you might be sprinting about all the while, spraying AK-47 fire around, or lobbing grenades from your launcher, the most effective sidearm available in the early game. Or perhaps you believe in truly going big. Elephants may seem like peaceful titans, but once mounted, they are one of Far Cry 4's most destructive forces. One story mission puts pachyderms to particularly good use, offering you plentiful opportunities to overturn oncoming vehicles with a quick flip of the trunk. You haven't truly lived until you have launched an opposing soldier into the air and heard his screams. If you come to games to feel powerful, Far Cry 4 quenches that need. That isn't to say the game is easy; insta-fail stealth missions and enemy artillery can bring the frustration, but you typically have the tools to counter it. If sneaking around is making you swear, a bow and arrow will do nicely. If you're being mobbed, you can spend a token that spawns an AI companion to fight at your side. It is you and a giant map dotted with activities, each one fun enough that you want to rush towards the waypoint to see what's in store there. Real-life companions are even better. A buddy (or stranger) can join you on your adventure, and the two of you become a kind of madcap duo, wreaking even more havoc on Kyrat's struggling economy by ruining and pillaging everything in sight. It's fun to get around in Far Cry 4's dinky gyrocopters, but the real joy is grappling to it and swinging to and fro as your comrade rises into the air. Should an enemy helicopter whir into view, it's tempting to take it out with a rocket, but you could always have your friend swing you into range, and blast the copter's pilot with a shotgun to the face. Should a pack of dholes (wild dogs, that is) attack, it's nice to shoot and skin them with a pal at your side. There's a pleasant sense of camaraderie to it, the two of you tromping through a creek on elephants like a gray, wrinkly caravan. Far Cry 4 isn't content to simply provide a map loaded with icons to chase: it parades activities in front of you as if it's afraid you'll not notice just how much stuff there is to do. You liberate an outpost and drive away, and you're bombarded in ten seconds by notifications that it is already under attack. Should you return and provide support, your next departure might be met with the same instructions; should you drive off, Far Cry 4 informs you of your failure to protect the outpost. I'm grateful for the game's imperfect but helpful auto-drive feature, which allows you to hand over the wheel to the AI if you want to focus on firing your pistol at pursuing ATVs. I'm not so grateful for Far Cry 4's habit of moving the waypoint icon to nearby outposts under attack on my behalf, thus causing my vehicle to drive where the game wants, not where I want. Why is such a massive sandbox so eager to lure me away from my own adventure? Why would a game whose best story is the one I make for myself keep thrusting some other story in front of me, making me eat my broccoli before I'm allowed to have dessert? stuff, wanting a thing that requires that you do another thing, which in turn requires that you do even another thing. Of course, that stuff follows a recipe Ubisoft has been stewing for years now, which is filling but starting to taste too familiar. This is the Far Cry/Assassin's Creed/Watch Dogs formula on hyperdrive: no piece of real estate is safe from the stuff-web.   The story at least provides plenty of diversity. Sometimes, you're pumped full of drugs and float away to Shangri-la, where you admire the dreamy visuals and sic tigers on demons; sometimes, you're maintaining oxygen levels while exploring the perilous heights of the Himalayas. Far Cry 3's missions ultimately made the greater impression: Far Cry 4's drug-destroying quest owes a clear debt to its predecessor's similar (and better) analog, and 3's hallucinogenic trips were more memorable than the sojourns to Shangri-la. Even so, Far Cry 4's best missions make good use of the game's general scale, providing intricate spreads of horizontal and vertical spaces, and giving you the freedom to approach them as you like. Assassin's Creed II, and unveil new portions of the map in the manner of, well, most recent Ubisoft games. The condensed freeform missions, on the other hand, are more akin to Splinter Cell: Blacklist, though that isn't the only feature reminiscent of Sam Fisher's more recent games. Far Cry 4 features a light bit of competitive play that pits two asymmetrical teams against each other. The objectives change depending on which mode you choose, but the basics remain the same. One group plays as hunters, armed with bows and arrows, and capable of going invisible and mounting elephants; the other drives standard vehicles and selects from a full array of weapons, approaching battle with sheer force. The best part of competitive play is that it offers many of the campaign's freedoms. You can ride the winds in your wingsuit towards a capture point, create ad-hoc walls of flame with molotovs, and snipe a competitor while he struggles to fend off an attacking bird of prey. Teams also seek to control towers that reveal hunters on the minimap (or remove them), which adds another speck of strategy to the proceedings. These five-on-five matches are open-ended delights, not so much because the battles are loaded with tension, but because they reward adaptability, and in doing so, echo the campaign. It's a problematic campaign, certainly, forcing you to restart an entire mission from scratch if you arrive at your destination and realize you'd like a different loadout, and making you reach for the radio dial so you don't have to listen to the worst radio personality this side of the Great Wall of China. It's when you circumvent Far Cry 4's major thematic flaws, inconsistent missions, and incessant nagging that you find the game you came looking for, breathing easy and enjoying the mountains that rise in the distance and the valleys that stretch beneath you. Like the terrain if depicts, Far Cry 4 travels both high and low, representing the good, the bad, and ugly of video games all at once. It's awesome and messy and dumb and fun and annoying and gross and beautiful. Take any given adjective in your vocabulary, and chances are, it will in some way describe Far Cry 4."
955,Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga,8.0,2,"The premise is the same: The evil witch Cackletta and her talkative minion Fawful have devised a scheme to conquer both the Mushroom Kingdom and the neighboring Beanbean Kingdom, starting with turning Princess Peach's voice into an explosive force. Bowser, angry that he can't abduct Peach in this state, teams up with Mario and an (unwilling) Luigi to give chase in an airship, only for the brothers to crash-land in foreign territory. Mario and Luigi must brave the strange lands of Beanbean to stop Cackletta's plan. And while that's going on, Bowser's armies are on their own quest to figure out just where the heck he vanished to.While the core game remains the same, the already great visuals get a gorgeous update on 3DS. The art has been completely redone, from the core sprites of Mario and Luigi to the tiniest of background details, and the result is some of the most beautiful and vibrant 2D art around. Various character animations have also been touched up and expanded upon, giving the brothers and their foes a lot of extra personality through their movements. (Sit back and watch some of the duo's idle animations during combat when you have a spare moment-- – it's a real treat.) The music has also been revised and expanded, with longer melodies and higher-quality instrumentation adding an additional spring to the step of the bouncy, energetic tunes from ace composer Yoko Shimomura. The only disappointment in the audiovisual department is the complete lack of a 3D option. We've seen how good other “2D- art- in- 3D” games look on the 3DS, and given that the game has its fair share of perspective and platform puzzles, it would have been both a big help and a great visual enhancement.The silly story of Superstar Saga is brought to life through dialogue and events that evoke the whimsical, humorous nature of the Mario universe. Characters like the elegant Prince of the Beanbean Kingdom and the wicked Cackletta have memorable quirks that make their personas stand out. Even some of the more minor side NPCs, like the Chuckola Bros, have a notable amount of care and attention put into their speech. That still shows through after all these years--though the most memorable character, Fawful, doesn't have quite the impact he once did, coming off an era where nonsensical JRPG translations were common.The core gameplay remains primarily the same as the original game, with a few enhancements. You explore various environments from an overhead view, using special skills to navigate and solve puzzles when necessary. When you encounter an enemy, you enter a battle sequence that blends turn-based commands with timing-based button presses to both deal extra damage to enemies and evade or counter their attacks. Some subtle improvements from later games in the Mario and Luigi series have been added, too: The pair can now perform an emergency guard during combat by pressing the X button, reducing damage from enemy attacks if you're not confident in your evasion skills. You can also retry boss fights on an easier difficulty if you get a game over. Story scenes can be sped up by holding down the R button, making some of the dialogue-heavy scenes zip by faster if you've seen them before (or if you're a speed reader). These additions help streamline the experience, but by and large, if you remember the events of the original Superstar Saga, you're going through the same motions in the remake.Most the brand-new content is in a sub-game that opens a little over an hour into the main story. Called ""Minion Quest,"" this is a separate adventure with no bearing on the main story that follows a gallant Goomba who wants to find and rescue his Lord Bowser. To accomplish this, he needs to find other minions from Bowser's army, convince them to band together, and fight against Fawful's brainwashed hordes.Instead of a traditional RPG, Minion Quest plays like a simplified real-time strategy game: You assemble a small army of troops from characters you've recruited and send them to battle against other armies. It feels pretty hands-off. Most of what you do is just watch characters bop each other and press buttons when prompted, since you can't really control your army the way you would in a proper RTS (for example, you can't tell troops to fall back and guard your commander if enemies break through your lines of defense). It can also get very frustrating and grindy--some quests practically demand you use a specific character type to counter a specific opponent, requiring you to either replay previous quests until you either randomly recruit enough of that character or get your levels high enough that it doesn't matter. And sometimes even when you do bring a counter to the enemy's forces, you can lose for reasons that feel completely arcane. As cute and charming as the cutscenes depicting the power struggle among Bowser's army are, several of the fights in Minion Quest can really test your patience and willingness to continue.Even though Minion Quest falters, it's still an optional outing that doesn't detract from what's fundamentally an excellent adventure. Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga has aged astonishingly well, and the various improvements offered in this remake only serve to make an already great game even better. Whether you're a series veteran or visiting the Beanbean Kingdom for the very first time, there's no better way to experience this classic RPG."
1917,War Thunder,8.0,2,"  When it comes to air combat, a trio of game difficulty settings allows everyone from casual shooters to more hardcore simmers to get comfortable. You can play in the physics-lite Arcade Battles mode, move up to the more rigorous Realistic setting, or go all-out with the grueling Simulator option. Arcade is the easiest way to play, thanks to amenities like starting in mid-flight in aerial combat and offering unlimited ammo both in the air and on the ground. Realistic mode tosses in a more punishing physics model along with the need to take off and land when flying. And Simulator mode takes the game to true flight simulator territory, planting you in a cockpit (the third-person camera option isn’t available here) and forcing your soaring feat of mechanical engineering to compete with the laws of Newtonian physics. Most players are gravitating toward the Arcade mode, which is all about pure adrenaline. Plane physics are very forgiving, so you can soar into crazy climbs and stomach-dropping dives without fearing too much about causing a stall or tearing your wings off in mid-air. You can also get goofy with shooting and blast away without much concern about accuracy, as you’ve always got fresh rounds ready to load into the chamber (although reloading does take a few seconds, which can seem like an eternity in the middle of a battle). All of this lets you focus on pure attack and defense, whether you’re scrapping with enemy fighters, strafing ground vehicles, or dropping bombs.   War Thunder’s tank combat is more generic, regardless of the difficulty setting. So are the tanks themselves. All of them zip around and turn more like dune buggies than Panzers, which levels the playing field between the Arcade, Realistic, and Simulator modes. Sure, they don’t roll around as quickly (especially when trying to head up any sort of incline) or turn on a dime quite as easily in Realistic as opposed to Arcade, but the overall feel remains loose across the board. This has the benefit of making tank battles play more like casual shooters, which of course makes them easier to immediately get into than the aerial combat. All tanks are properly modeled when it comes to armor, as well. This lends a certain amount of tactical thinking to battles, as you can’t just pound away on any exposed part of an enemy tank and expect to do damage. As a result, it’s a must to find cover and smart firing positions.        "
3545,Arc the Lad: End of Darkness,5.0,1,"  Arc the Lad has been around long enough to be a grown man by now. For nearly a decade, the Arc series of role-playing games has appeared on Sony consoles in Japan and the US. Past installments in the series have been fairly standard turn-based role-playing games set in a fantasy universe that threatens to implode every so often, unless a group of unlikely heroes comes along to save the day--which, conveniently, it always does. End of Darkness moves into new territory, as it's the first entry in the series to feature online play and an action-oriented battle system. Unfortunately, the new battle system is mindless and repetitive, and the online multiplayer does nothing to mitigate the weak single-player campaign, lifeless characters, and dull presentation of the game.        Arc the Lad: End of Darkness takes place in the same universe as Twilight of the Spirits and is set five years after the events of it. You play as Edda, a young orphan boy who has, until now, led a simple but unexciting life on an isolated island. Eventually, Edda realizes that he's an exorcist who's capable of dispatching the evil darmysts, later known as malademons, that have been popping up to attack people throughout the world. These malademons are the manifestations of the ""bad feelings"" in the hearts of man, and the only way to destroy them is to exorcise the evil that pervades these beings. After an initial encounter with a malademon, Edda decides to join the hunter's guild to use his powers to rid the world of evil. As Edda investigates, he finds out there's a terrorist group known as Truth Sword that's threatening to ""cleanse"" the world of the destructive and ignorant humans. Edda also finds himself meeting up with an enigmatic and ill-tempered young woman named Kirika, who seems to have some connection to Truth Sword. As you progress through the story, you'll discover more about Edda's past, the origins of the malademons, and what has become of the characters that saved the world from ruin in Twilight of the Spirits. The story is generic and cliché, and if you've ever played a role-playing game, you'll recognize all the worn-out themes present here. Amnesia, magic versus technology, tumultuous race relations, a dying world... It's all here, and it's wrapped up in one bland, uninspired package.     The story unfolds incrementally as you complete various tasks throughout the game. As a hunter, you can go to a guild where you'll be able to take on tasks from either the notice board or the counter. The counter tasks are short and are divided into classes based on difficulty. A more difficult task will earn you more experience points, but the risk is greater, because the spells you equip to your ALD--a wristband infused with special energy that lets hunters equip skills cards--will be lost if you fail to complete a task. Notice-board tasks are longer and multitiered, often requiring you to meet multiple objectives before the task is finished. Completing the notice-board tasks not only progresses the story, but it also nets you dignity points, which are required to level up. As with the counter tasks, notice-board tasks are classified according to rank, so you can only complete a veteran task if your hunter rank is veteran, and so on. Once you have 10 dignity points and 10 experience points, you can go to the hunter exam center to take a promotion exam to increase your rank. The exams consist of a series of three battles that must be completed within a certain time frame. As your rank increases, your stats will improve, and you'll be able to take on more-advanced tasks to further the storyline. However, the result of this task system is a storyline that feels disjointed, because it unfolds through several small, tangentially related events.      Whether you choose a counter task or a notice-board task, you'll have to be prepared to fight. The battle system is entirely action-oriented, much like the basic combat system found in games like Champions of Norrath. You'll only ever control a single character in battle, although with the right cards, you can play as other characters from past Arc the Lad games, as there are more than 20 character cards in all. These other characters can only be used when completing counter tasks or when playing online, because, unfortunately, most of these characters don't factor into the story at all. So the novelty of getting to see your favorite characters from Twilight of the Spirits again is fleeting.       While some of the counter tasks require you to capture a monster, arrest a criminal, or find an object, you'll still just be hacking and slashing monsters most of the time. All your items and skills are based on cards, which you can purchase at shops or find on the battlefield. You can assign specific magic or techniques to each of the four face buttons, and you can use them by holding R2. Using magic or techniques requires ""card points,"" which are held in a tank that is replenished slowly by the card points stored in your subtanks. During battle, you can hold the triangle button to regenerate your card points faster, but doing so leaves you vulnerable to attack. However, in most battles, a simple attack will suffice. As a result, you'll just be tapping X repeatedly to perform slashes and combo attacks. And by tapping the X button three or four times, you'll perform a combo of two to four strikes that does more damage but leaves you open to counterattacks.         For the most part, battles are extremely easy, since most enemies aren't quick or clever enough to avoid your attacks. However, it's easy to get trapped in a corner where you'll quickly get pummeled by a group of enemies. When you get knocked down, you'll be invulnerable to attacks for a few seconds. However, you still can't run past enemies that block your path, so you just end up getting slaughtered due to some poor level design. Another source of frustration in battle is the camera. You can lock on to enemies using the L2 button, and you can sidestep around them with L1 and R1. And when you're locked on to an enemy, the camera pulls in close to the action, which can be helpful. But often the camera will get stuck behind a tree, a crate, or another part of the level. Subsequently, you won't be able to see what you're doing. Pressing L2 again either cancels the lock-on or switches it to another enemy. However, you don't always feel in control of the targeting system, so it's often easier to avoid the lock-on targeting altogether, unless you're using ranged attacks or magic.        In addition to the generic bad guys, you'll occassionally fight malademons, which look exactly like any other enemy but have a black mist around them. The malademons are stronger, faster, and more aggressive than normal enemies. Once you inflict enough damage to a malademon, it will be stunned, at which point you can press the circle button to perform a special exorcism attack. Exorcising enemies earns you spirit points that are later used to increase the rank of other characters in your party.      Aside from earning spirit points and collecting dropped cards and items, there's no reason to fight any enemies unless your task objective specifically requires it. You don't gain experience points from fighting monsters, and, for the most part, you can run right past any enemies you encounter. During battle, you can't progress to the next area if you've been spotted by an enemy, but you can quickly lose him or her and move on without consequence. While the lack of experience points and leveling helps make online play slightly more balanced than it otherwise would be, it makes the battles feel ancillary and unnecessary. Killing enemies will get you cards, but most cards aren't that important. The only cards that are really worth searching for are character cards. Most of the other cards can be purchased or created through the process of synthesis. Card synthesis is the procedure of combining two cards to create a single, more powerful card. For example, you can combine a cure card with a magical stone to get a ""cure 2"" card. It's easy to try various combinations to see what you get, because there's no penalty for creating a bad combo.   In addition to the overly simplified and unsatisfying combat, End of Darkness doesn't look or sound impressive, either. The entire world is made up of five continents, each with a single town. The towns are empty and, for the most part, devoid of any signs of life. Aside from visiting the guild and card shop, you won't have any reason to spend any time in any of the towns. And while the towns are boring, the rest of the world might as well not even exist. There's no exploration involved when traveling throughout the world. You simply pick a destination, and you're instantly transported there. The battlefields are likewise without any distinguishing characteristics. In fact, you'll often see the exact same hallway or room multiple times during a single battle, except there will be two blobs and one dragon instead of two dragons and one blob. Also, sometimes you'll see the exact same backgrounds used during battles that are supposed to be taking place on entirely different continents.    The character models don't look any better than the environments, either. There are a few generic townsfolk, as well as a handful of your basic animal, mechanical, and human enemies in the game. The enemies aren't varied or interesting, but to its credit, the game does feature a wide assortment of colored blobs to fight--from green, to yellow, to pink. The main characters look blocky and wooden, and during the cutscenes, they make a few repetitive, unnatural gestures that just look ridiculous.    Of course, the gestures have to be exaggerated, because there are no voices to convey the emotions of the characters. Most of the time you'll just watch your character wave his hands around while silently mouthing dialogue. It's especially odd considering the previous installment in the Arc the Lad series had full voice work. While the cutscenes are totally silent, your character has plenty to say in battle. Unfortunately, all that's said are a few catchphrases, like, ""Is that the best you can do?"" and ""Take that!"". These phrases are repeated endlessly throughout the battles, and unlike the last game, this time around, there's no option to turn the battle chatter off.      The single-player campaign only takes about 20 hours to complete, but once you finish the story, you can continue playing the game to finish all the tasks you might have skipped earlier. Also, you can take your character online to play with up to eight players in cooperative missions, as well as engage in head-to-head or team-based combat. There are dozens of missions--ranging in difficulty and length--that you can choose to play with a group of up to four players. Some of the missions have multiple stages, and if you die on one stage, you'll be resurrected on the next stage...as long as there's at least one surviving member of the party. When you complete the cooperative tasks, you earn points that determine your rank among all the other players online. You'll also find cards, which you can then use in the single-player game to strengthen your character. Overall, the cooperative tasks and the player-versus-player battles are more fun than the battles in the single-player mode. However, they still require minimal skill to complete.    As more and more role-playing games turn to action-based combat systems, it's no surprise to see Arc the Lad following suit. Unfortunately, despite the inclusion of a somewhat amusing online component, End of Darkness takes the series to a new low with an uninteresting story and a tedious battle system. If you're a diehard Arc the Lad fan, you might take comfort in the return of some of the characters from the previous games. But even the most loyal fans will be disappointed with End of Darkness.  "
3295,Naruto Shippuden: Dragon Blade Chronicles,4.0,0,"           Unfortunately, there's no joy to be found in exploring the environments to make up for the frustrations of the combat. One passageway of Mount Koryu looks so much like the next that it's very easy at times to run in circles, trying to figure out which way you haven't been and where to go next. (It doesn't help that the in-game map is completely useless.) And although the environmental puzzles you encounter on occasion sometimes provide a welcome alternative to the repetitive monster-hacking, they bring with them their own frustrations. These puzzles often require you to use a specific power on something in the environment; however, at times you might use the correct power, but because you're not standing in precisely the right spot when you do it, it doesn't work.       "
4482,Supercar Street Challenge,4.0,0," Supercars are where technology and art meet to create some of the fastest, most futuristic-looking cars in the world. These embodiments of speed and grace form the cream of the automotive crop and objects of desire and fascination for car enthusiasts. Exakt Entertainment's Supercar Street Challenge taps into that mystique and puts you behind the wheel of these exotic beauties, even letting you design your own. Yet for all its promise, Supercar Street Challenge will only leave you racing to find a better game.    On the surface, the most promising feature of Supercar Street Challenge is the ability to craft your own concept cars in the ""Steve Saleen Styling Studio."" Steve Saleen is a longtime racecar driver and founder of Saleen Inc., which creates limited-edition, high-performance cars like the noted S7. As exciting as this studio might sound on paper, prepare for a huge letdown. Pretty much all you do is install a few different bodywork segments and then morph them in real time into different styles, none of which has any performance impact. You can install simple parts like mirrors or wings that you earn in the game's championship mode, name your car, choose its color, and perform other very rudimentary operations on it, but you can't really get under the hood. Real supercars aren't just about looks, but about performance. Here all you do is distribute points among four grossly oversimplified characteristics: speed, braking, acceleration, and handling.   In addition to your own inventions, you can race with a number of real-world vehicles that are certainly enough to get an auto enthusiast excited. There's the Saleen S7 with its 7.0-liter V8, the Pontiac Concept GTO that fuses futuristic styling with the look of a classic muscle car, and the improbably bulbous Rinspeed E-GO Rocket, which looks like a 1940s vision of a car from the future. You'll also get to drive the Bertone Pickster, Lotus M220, Callaway C12, Vision CTEK K/2, Fioravanti F100, and Pagani Zonda C12-S. It's not the biggest selection of cars compared to some racing games, but it's perhaps better to have a handful of really interesting, unique vehicles than a hundred boring ones.   With Supercar Street Challenge, that logic doesn't actually apply since the game is a pure arcade-style racer. You don't actually get to enjoy these world-class cars, since the cars in the game bear little apparent connection to reality, other than their looks. You certainly won't get to enjoy any subtle differences between them, and the game's physics are utterly improbable: You can take 90-degree corners at 100mph--in a downpour, no less--without any cares. You don't have to worry about spins or flips since it's nearly impossible to lose control. You can slam into walls or other cars at high speed with no visible or performance detriment. Featuring licensed cars in the game ultimately amounts to little more than a marketing tease.   Lax arcade physics aside, Supercar Street Challenge does give you a good sense of speed as you hurtle through city intersections at outrageous speeds. The problem is that you get a sense of speed but no sense of danger. It's one thing to stand on the accelerator as buildings blur past, knowing that the slightest mistake could wrap your car around a tree. You won't get that sort of tension here: You could drop the cars in this game from an orbiting space shuttle and they'd keep on driving. Without any adrenaline-inducing sense of fear, the sense of speed is a novelty that wears off after a couple of laps.   At least you get a decent selection of tracks. Races play out in seven different locales: Los Angeles, London, Monaco, Munich, Paris, Rome, and Turin. Each area includes around three to five different courses. You can't access all the courses or cars right away in the game's quick race or time attack modes, though. For that, you'll need to play the championship mode. Here you can enter a design series using a car you create in the styling studio, or you can enter various series using the licensed cars. Since the racing offers so little of interest, there's almost no incentive to keep slogging through these series.   The game's overall presentation is as poor as the racing, though the soundtrack is a little interesting. These days, it seems like nearly every racing game resorts to some style of techno music, and most of it ends up a forgettable waste of notes. That's only partially true of Supercar Street Challenge, which features yet more techno, but techno with a difference: Real bands like Cirrus composed the tracks. Overall, this isn't exceptional game music by any stretch of the imagination, but some of the cuts are pretty catchy, and they fit the onscreen action well. It's a step in the right direction.   The actual sound effects come off very poorly. Engines just have a simplistic whine that doesn't really scream ""high-performance engine,"" but rather ""generic sound effect."" The same is true of screeching tires or the little bangs you hear when cars bump a wall or each other. The sound effects can actually hinder gameplay, too. When you play a racing game with cars set to manual transmission, you should usually know when to up-shift by sound alone. That's not always possible here because of the sloppy engine sound effects; you'll need to keep glancing at the tachometer. This weakness is doubly problematic because an apparent bug can prevent the cars from shifting out of first gear when set to automatic transmission. Needless to say, you won't win any races like that.   Supercar Street Challenge is a visual disappointment, too. All the exotic cars and locales just beg for the deluxe graphics treatment, but the game looks about two years out of date. It's utterly outclassed visually by games like NASCAR Racing 4, 4x4 EVO 2, and Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed. Particle effects like the smoke from spinning tires look unconvincing, and cars all feature an improbably glossy sheen. Overall, the drab textures and poorly detailed scenery offer precious little to catch your eye. You don't get a rearview mirror in the optional first-person view modes, either; instead you have to temporarily glance backward. On a happier note, city skyscrapers, particularly those lining the Los Angeles tracks, look realistically tall and imposing. If you weren't roaring down the road at 150mph, you'd want to crane your virtual neck to get a glimpse at their towering tops.   Supercar Street Challenge is an excellent opportunity wasted. Despite a roster of licensed cars that rank among the best in the world, you never really get to enjoy them. Instead you get an oversimplified arcade racer without a drop of the wildness or excitement that the best arcade racers offer. If you want more than half an hour's light entertainment from your racing games, detour well around this one.    	  "
2494,Primal Carnage,6.0,1,"  Of the great dream matchups in humankind's evolutionary history, none is more pervasive than humans versus dinosaurs. Countless books, movies, video games, and more have broached this subject, but a definitive winner remains elusive. The latest in this ongoing academic effort is Primal Carnage, a team-based, competitive multiplayer game that hits on a fun design, but stumbles in execution. A lack of content and some technical issues leave this game feeling like a $15 beta rather than an official release.        Each side is composed of five distinct classes. On the human side, every class comes equipped with a gun, as well as a secondary ability. At the most basic there's the commando. He has a machine gun that shoots lots of bullets and doubles as a grenade launcher. Pretty simple. On the other end of the spectrum sits the trapper. He can disable dinosaurs with his slow-firing net gun and wields two pistols that can be fired (and reloaded) independently.          Despite having wildly different play styles, the humans and dinosaurs are well balanced against one another. Each human class is designed to best a specific dinosaur, and vice versa. For example, commandos are great at laying down fire on a slow-moving T. rex, but have trouble tracking nimble raptors (who are easily netted by trappers). This subtly encourages a balance of classes during every match by further defining each character's role. In turn, this balance creates more dynamic, and enjoyable, matches.   Jurassic Park-esque hilarity, because every faint footstep or distant growl can lead to near-instant death. And when you see a bush rustle out of the corner of your vision, you know it can't be anything good.      With 10 characters, five maps, and one game mode, Primal Carnage is short on content. The core game is a lot of fun, but it grows repetitive and is subject to the quality of competition found online. And since this game is online only, there are no offline training or single-player modes. Creating a private room to test-drive the characters isn't even an option, since you cannot enable a password. To play, you must undergo a trial by fire with the rest of the game's community.     Getting shot by other players is bad enough, but you can also get shot down by the game's technical bugs. Oversized geometry and background elements flickering in and out of existence are some of the less-serious hiccups. At the time of this publication, the option for antialiasing has been removed because some players have reported that enabling it causes repeated game crashing. On a less serious note, sometimes after losing a match the game will display the victory logo. While inaccurate, this mismatched logo does help boost self-esteem.       Thankfully, the developers have been quick to release updates to correct these issues. But this less-than-stellar first impression may sour your interest interest in this prehistoric cage match. Primal Carnage has the markings of a great game, but is held back by a number of bugs and a shortage of content. For a game that celebrates the excitement of dinosaurs, hopefully it will not share their fate.  "
1260,Yo-kai Watch 2,5.0,1,"The story begins when the protagonist--you can again choose between a young boy or girl--wakes up with the events of the previous game erased from their memory. You rediscover Whisper, the exuberant ghostly butler that accompanied you in the first game, and set about your daily life relearning all the same basic taming tricks from the first game. It feels like a lazy narrative choice to hit the memory-reset button on the main character for the sake of plot, especially when the first Yo-kai Watch did an excellent job of world-building at a strong, steady pace. Yo-kai Watch 2 also adds a time-travel element to its already unevenly paced narrative, making the entire affair feel a little too cliched.One great addition to Yo-kai Watch 2's world-building is the addition of new areas. Wider sections of your hometown of Springdale are open to explore, and new towns beyond its borders are accessible by train. Unfortunately, riding the in-game train is much the same as a real one--you have to wait for long stretches of time between stops on the way to your location--and it’s a drag on the action. Once you discover teleportation points, however, this becomes a moot point. However, most portals aren't found until much later in the game.Most of Yo-kai Watch 2's main missions are, just as in its predecessor, fetch quests. The game features a few small additions meant to change things up, such as environmental puzzles where one misstep will send you back to the start of the maze or pop quizzes meant to test your knowledge of yo-kai. But even these can't save the main thread from monotony. After I spent more than a dozen hours running from one end of Springdale to the other searching for a Spritzer or a certain type of yo-kai, my enjoyment of the world and my patience ran thin. Even the boss battles against gargantuan and some particularly clever yo-kai waiting at the end of these quests couldn't save me from boredom.Combat in Yo-kai Watch 2 is identical to that in the first game. The bottom screen of the 3DS displays a six-spoked wheel, displaying the yo-kai in your possession. Three are on the battlefield at any time, and you can rotate the wheel to change up your active party. Once again, setting yo-kai of the same elemental type next to each other will net you bonuses in battle, such as dealing extra damage or moving more quickly. The fighting system is still mostly passive, and sometimes you can win a battle without pressing a single button. Yo-kai attack on their own, with very little input; you can press a button to queue up a minigame that charges a yo-kai's most powerful Soultimate attack or play a similar minigame to purify a yo-kai that’s been possessed by an enemy.This all becomes rote very quickly, with the only exception being boss battles. Most have a weak spot on them that can be targeted with the tap of a stylus, and you must plan your attack strategy around breaking down this specific area. Once weakened, a boss becomes more susceptible to your attacks, and since some of these battles have multiple stages, it's a good idea to plan ahead rather than leave chance in the hands of the passive battle system.Once again, I found myself frustrated most by the lack of guidance in successfully recruiting yo-kai into my party. After a random encounter, there's a certain likelihood that an enemy yo-kai will approach and ask to be your friend. This possibility is increased by giving the yo-kai its favorite food in battle--but what that food could be is never made clear or recorded anywhere, even in Yo-kai Watch 2's in-game Yo-kai Pad. Late in the game, my yo-kai collection was woefully lacking, since I‘d already grown weary of the trial-and-error practice of throwing one of every food in my inventory at every creature I saw.Yo-kai Watch 2's most welcome additions are multiplayer battles and trading. Like in the Pokemon games, players can match online to test their yo-kai's skills outside of the single-player section. Unfortunately, the same issue in single-player battles is present here, with most fights able to play out without any player input. And trading's best boon is allowing players on each version of the game--Bony Spirits and Fleshy Souls--to swap and collect yo-kai exclusive to each version.Yo-kai Watch 2 does preserve the quirky tone and charming writing that made the first game so engaging, but its lack of iteration is problematic in that there aren't enough fresh ideas to color its monotonous gameplay. The game feels old hat, taking you through well-trod ground--albeit with a fresh coat of paint and a few new faces. If you're a fan of the original Yo-kai Watch and feel invested in its world, then the lore laid down in Bony Spirits and Fleshy Souls is worth toying around with in the nearly two-dozen hours you'll spend in the campaign. But if you're looking for something original, you should pass on Yo-kai Watch 2."
725,Left Alive,3.0,0,"Set in the same universe as the long-neglected Front Mission series, you alternate between three main characters--a rookie Wanzer pilot, a former military veteran turned beat cop, and a ghosted merc who’s been presumed dead for two years. Each character is on a different path to try and escape the city that’s overrun with enemy mechs and soldiers. Their paths will intertwine over the course of the game’s 14 missions allowing for some occasionally fun interplay between the protagonists, but that’s about as interesting as their story gets. Moments of both political and personal intrigue go for knockout blows with almost no set up, leaving them feeling flat and impactless, and the story never really gets back on its feet.Surviving the numerous open-world sections of the city is the main point of Left Alive, avoiding combat where possible and traversing slowly and silently through the torn up streets littered with abandoned cars and flaming piles of rubbish. As you move from point to point, you’ll scavenge items and components--from empty cans and bottles to stripping parts from destroyed drones--in order to craft traps and projectiles. But even with these tools, progress comes slowly, and arduously, for a variety of different reasons, the chief of which is the game’s stunningly poor combat.Weapons in general feel woefully inadequate and underpowered. Guns are weak and make a lot of noise (inviting any enemy within a block to bear fire down upon your position) and headshots don’t ever result in a one hit kill. Bullet impacts feel scattered and inconsistent, with perfect reticle aim not ensuring a hit--even on the first shot. Melee weapons aren’t much better, you’re more likely to get knocked down yourself before you can them so it’s always a high risk move, and there’s no stealth bonus for sneaky attacks. Projectile weapons are more stealth-oriented as the AI aren’t able to track where a thrown item came from, but they are equally as ineffective at putting the enemy down for good.The stilted and jittery combat sucks the air out of every enemy engagement, but you’re consistently forced into it. Koshka’s incessant reminder of “Caution, the enemy is approaching” on a loop when in close proximity to a guard just adds to the annoyance. Checkpoints and save points are scarce, and more often than not the direct route to each is blocked by a number of patrolling guards or worse, a comparably overpowered Wanzer, meaning a lot of backtracking to save points in safer zones in order to avoid replaying tedious sections. Although the game’s map tries to usefully point out high alert zones, it doesn’t feel like there’s any tangible difference between the two; safe zones are just as likely to be teeming with patrolling guards as alert zones are.Side missions come in the form of other survivors, many of whom only need to be accompanied to the nearest shelter, of which there are a handful strewn about each map. Some will go easily, while others are in distress and need convincing to move via a handful of dialogue choices, though these feel trite--it never felt like it mattered if they were rescued or not. They’re helpless and will quickly go down if fired at, unless you clear their path beforehand they have frustratingly little chance of making it to the shelter safely. But the risk of taking more guards head on just to get survivors out quickly turns into a tiring and unfulfilling routine.Wanzers are the only part of Left Alive that bucks its mediocrity. When moving through the city, these imposing behemoths will patrol along the wider open sections of the map, sweeping the area from on high. Most of the time they can be avoided by finding a clearer route, but sometimes you’ll need to get unnervingly close, creating a palpable sense of fear as you try to sneak by them undetected. Getting noticed by a Wanzer spells almost certain death, unless you can get your hands on a rocket launcher and a good sniping spot, which will take them down with a few well placed shots to the torso.Even better is when you get behind the controls of a Wanzer and give the enemy a healthy dose of their own medicine. Weapons, from rocket launchers and huge assault rifles to shoulder mounted railguns, each has a distinct feel to them. For example, the railgun requires your mech to kneel to make a more stable platform and then a second to warm up before firing, but will cause tremendous damage with a direct hit. All weapons overheat at different times if not allowed to breathe out in between shots, but if you time it right you can easily alternate between your main four to unload continuous fire.Save for Wanzer-related activities, almost no part of Left Alive feels good to play; it’s painfully slow, inconsistent, and looks incredibly dated. Environment textures are muddied and lack detail, animations don’t blend together that well which gives everything a slightly jolting look. Blowing up an enemy vehicle sees it simply disappear into thin air behind a flat, low-res fire texture. When you mix moments like that with the already tiring combat, which is compounded further during some utterly infuriating late-game boss fights, it really hits home how far wide of the mark Left Alive is.Perhaps the worst part is that you can see there’s something here, ideas that have some real potential but never even come close to being realised. The Wanzer combat is genuinely rad, but that’s it. Everything else comes with a heavy caveat; be it how underpowered you feel, the awkward movement, the inconsistent bullet impacts, the ugly environments… the list goes on. There’s almost no joy to be found in playing Left Alive, only bitter disappointment."
2788,Grotesque Tactics 2: Dungeons &amp; Donuts,3.0,0,"  Strategy role-playing games typically come in two flavors: games in which you either amass large armies of units (such as King's Bounty) or those in which the focus is to gather a group of heroes (such as the Disciples series). Grotesque Tactics 2: Dungeons &amp; Donuts takes the Disciples route, so the basic setup should be familiar to anyone who has invested time in the genre. Unfortunately, the game is let down by a plethora of problems, including a shallow combat system, incomplete translations, and a slanderous sense of humor that makes this an uncomfortable and tiresome experience.        In Grotesque Tactics 2, the emo star of the first game, Drake, must form his own adventuring guild and assemble a group of misfit adventurers. The guildmates you acquire are an assortment of characters that are little more than stereotypes, such as the jive-talkin' black man, the ditzy blonde, and a holier-than-thou angel that loves nothing more than to bicker with a dark undead adventuress. If you thought cookie-cutter characters was the only unoriginal aspect of the story, there's some bad news. Drake suffers from the most well-worn plot trope: amnesia. As he regains his memory, you learn more about his past with some of his companions and the deadly fog that's plaguing the world, which has driven you underground to The Sanctuary (not only is it a safe place, but it's also your quest hub).      The story isn't interesting, and the same goes for the quests that you pursue in this tale. Within The Sanctuary are several factions--the mercenaries, the elves, and the humans--and you spend a great deal of time running among their bases and multiple dungeons as you accomplish tasks to curry favor. Your reputation with the various factions is important; as you gain more rep, you earn more quests and advance the plot (for what it's worth).      Early on, many of these quests are tedious, such as those that involve cooking meals for people. What's worse, you may receive a quest that sends you into a sealed-off area that can only be unlocked by completing a different quest. Grotesque Tactics 2 doesn't make the natural order of quests clear, and this, combined with quests that require you to interact with multiple character, makes for a lot of running back and forth around the Sanctuary. Such quests serve as mindless padding between the combat missions and makes you pine for the moments when you can use your sword rather than fry up some vittles.        Unfortunately, you face a different set of problems during combat. While exploring on the map, your companions march with you. But you can't set their marching order; the AI takes care of it. So when combat starts, they're all in a jumble, and when combat ends, they sometimes spread out. This can be problematic if they initiate another battle while spreading out, especially if you're not ready for a battle. When combat occurs, it's pretty standard turn-based fighting. You control your team against the AI foes, who are about as smart as a colony of sea sponges. They generally rush into the fray, targeting your guild members willy-nilly. And they never focus on healers; they just attack whoever is in range first.      The options available in combat are limited. As you level up, you can acquire and boost abilities on your character's skill tree. The sad thing is that a number of skills on these trees duplicate skills of other characters, so combat suffers from the lack of variety. And the skills on these trees are bland. Combat never feels truly tactical--fighting is all about simply whacking a foe, using a limited area-of-effect spell (that's centered on you, so you can't even fling a decent spell at your opponent), or shooting an arrow at the enemy. The only real tactical option comes with back attacks, which grant more damage.      The execution of combat is spotty, and the localization of this German game is a real issue. You receive the ""Translation is missing"" option in some conversation menus. This message also appears on some doors and gates in the dungeons; while the information isn't essential, it's nice for things in your game to have names. Sometimes, these names are still in German. The game also has some crash bugs, including one annoying crash that happens whenever you try to put more than three points into one of a character's skills, limiting his progression on that portion of the skill tree. These flaws point to one thing: The game isn't finished.         But what really sucks the joy out of Grotesque Tactics 2 is its humor. Sometimes, it seems to be poking fun at genre conventions, but the humor isn't sly--it's downright disrespectful. Nearly every female non-player character has a ditzy or sultry voice and is dressed in a skimpy getup. A number of these characters also make come-ons to you, and the dialogue is frequently laced with innuendo. The gear for your female guildmates is either a dress or a leather outfit, all of which seems more appropriate at a strip club than in an adventuring company. Holy Avatar, the demigod character, is a blond Adonis that keeps a harem of adoring maidens. You even have to steal one of their bras in a quest for a goblin that wants women's underwear for ""sniffinz."" (Gross!) And though women bear most of the brunt of the game's offensive characterizations, that's not always the case. For example, Deacon, the black character, talks in jive and keeps hitting on one of the female characters. Without wit or charm, Grostesque 2 ends up merely serving up more of the same stereotypical shlock that it intends to satire.     Grotesque Tactics 2 seems intended as a light take on a serious genre. Instead, it's a sexist disaster that is offensive when it means to be funny and flat when it means to be fun. Rather than deep combat, you get mindless tactics. Instead of interesting character progression, you face bland skill trees. The game isn't stable and is unfinished in parts, and the story leaves little impact on you. This all adds up to make Grotesque Tactics 2 one of the worst strategy RPGs in recent memory.  "
1955,Minecraft,8.0,2,"   At a glance, Minecraft on the PlayStation 3 is nearly identical to its Xbox 360 brethren. In terms of controls, neither version one-ups the other. When 4J Studios ported the game to the Xbox 360 in 2012, it paired the version with sharp, fluid controls. The company has shown the same love toward the PlayStation 3. It takes minutes to get attuned to Minecraft on the DualShock controller, and soon you find yourself punching trees with the best of them. With time, you craft the necessary tools required to tackle twisting mines and dense jungle terrain as you collect precious resources while fighting off temperamental creepers and spider jockeys. Once you get into the swing of things (typically in the form of a sword or pickaxe), it's doubtful the thought of needing a mouse and keyboard to master Minecraft's untamed wilds will ever cross your mind.     The major difference between the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 editions is not with gameplay, but with optional cosmetics. And in that regard, the PlayStation 3 is far behind. In Minecraft, you begin your adventure as the iconic blue-jeaned Steve. But what if you want to explore a dark-oak forest as Spider-Man, or Gordon Freeman? Those options are open if you choose to buy the respective downloadable skin packs on the Xbox 360. Additionally, there are skins inspired by popular indie games, and even one based on Marvel's The Avengers. And yet, none of these options are available for the PlayStation 3, though you can purchase a pack featuring console-exclusive skins based on the Uncharted and Killzone series of games, among others. Many of the texture packs, which completely change the look of the game, such as by giving it a flair of fantasy or mimicking the look of Skyrim, are also not yet available (it's not clear if they ever will be).  What is most disappointing is that Minecraft: PlayStation 3 Edition takes several steps back compared to the PC version, both in content and performance. Unlike in the PC game, the space in which to build your blocky empire is miniscule (on the computer, the space is virtually ""infinite""). The land on which you begin, which is always randomly generated, is shuttered on four sides by an immense ocean. Teasing the edge of the map rewards you with an invisible wall, and attempting an escape via wooden boat causes your seafaring vessel to despawn, leaving you to humbly swim back to shore. The PC version also sports sharper, cleaner details and a greater view distance. There is also some noticeable lag on the PlayStation 3 during weather effects such as rain or snow.  Regardless of the shortcomings, Minecraft on the PlayStation 3 delivers the essential gameplay experience that has made it a household name. You experience a bit of pride when you complete your first shelter, a feeling that increases exponentially as accumulated knowledge and skill result in castles or skyscrapers, or farms or lengthy railways, or all of the above. It all depends on what you want to accomplish in the world set at your feet. You delve into caverns lit by your hand-made torches, while fighting cave-dwelling spiders and bow-wielding skeletons. And despite the danger, you keep going, because you never know what treasures the next mined block will reveal. Just before you decide to return to the surface with your haul, you may stumble upon a vein of gold or rare diamond ore. Clearing a block could unearth an abandoned mine, filled with loot and danger, or a stunning cavern, glowing hot with flowing pools of lava, its ceiling reaching beyond your vision. Minecraft is a constant lesson in persistence, while effortlessly blending the joy of creation and the thrill of danger and exploration to form a game that is instantly accessible and near limitless in potential.  Minecraft: PlayStation 3 Edition is a joyous adventure, despite being lighter on content than its other iterations. It offers the freedom to unlock your imagination and design your own unique world, while the included Creative mode lets you build to your heart's content without having to worry about the limitations of resources. Though the smaller world may irk you, Minecraft on the PlayStation 3 supplements the design with a more user-friendly approach, straightforward crafting, and a much easier way to connect to friends via the PlayStation Network. Split-screen multiplayer lets you get together with friends or family to plan group projects from the couch. But whether you choose to tackle the game solo or with others, Minecraft: PlayStation 3 Edition is a rewarding experience that has you coming back again and again, building a personalized world borne of your imagination--one simple block at a time."
4882,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,2.0,0,"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring for the Game Boy Advance is based on the first book in J.R.R. Tolkien's immensely popular fantasy series. For fans of the novels, as well as for those who enjoyed the recent motion picture, this game offers the chance to wander around a digital replica of Middle-earth. But that's about all it offers. The range of interactivity is so low and the action is so infrequent that Frodo's quest to Mount Doom is reduced to nothing more than a trivial errand. What's more, the entire game is so unpolished and full of bugs that it's unfathomable how it ever passed quality assurance in the first place.  In the game, you play the role of Frodo, a young hobbit given the task of protecting the One Ring from Sauron, who himself originally forged it atop Mount Doom centuries prior. A prophecy foretells that nine kindred souls will form an alliance--a fellowship--to accompany Frodo on this long journey. The game begins where the book begins, in Hobbiton, and ends where the book ends, along the banks of the Anduin. The design of Fellowship of the Ring is similar to that of most role-playing games. There are people to talk to in every village who can offer advice or give you items that will prove invaluable throughout your quest. To get some of these items, you'll have to perform favors, such as retrieving a feather for Tom Bombadil before he'll help you rescue your friends from Old Man Willow in the old forest. Over the course of your travels, you'll also encounter a wide variety of trolls, orcs, wild dogs, and other dangerous creatures. Contact with these monsters inevitably leads to battle, during which each character takes turns attacking single or multiple enemies.     Although the description sounds nice on paper, Fellowship of the Ring really isn't any fun to play. The favors you'll perform are remarkably simple but often sidetrack the game to the extent that you'd just as soon avoid them. The game's battles are even worse. They're turn-based, which isn't a bad thing, but they're incredibly slow. You actually have to wait while each character slowly walks toward his target, makes an attack, and steps back into line. At the same time, the enemy always has the privilege of first attack, which means that it can be anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute before you even have a chance to retaliate. As it is, combat is pretty basic. The only available options are to attack with a sword, throw fireworks, defend, heal, or flee.  Ironically, although each battle takes forever to finish, you don't gain experience from any of them. Instead, you acquire health and skill upgrades automatically at various points throughout the story. While this is an innovative aspect, it just makes all of the time you'll spend in battle that much more frustrating.    The game's plot exposition is terribly light as well. You'll encounter all of the major characters, as well as a few peripheral ones, but none of them possess even half of the personality and dignity that they showed in the book. Barliman Butterbur, the barkeep in Bree, is reduced to nothing more than an innkeeper, rather than the knowledgeable informant who helps Frodo flee the rampaging Nazgul. The Nazgul themselves also play a somewhat diminished role. Instead of tracking the group to Bree and forcing a tense confrontation at Bruinen, they just block the road in various spots and later spring an ambush. Not once is it ever explained that these nine evil servants bear rings similar to Frodo's. You can't expect a video game to include every event and conversation from a 430-page novel, but Fellowship of the Ring doesn't even try.   Despite its minimal dialogue, the game does at least follow the progression of the book. Just as in the text, you'll start in Hobbiton, make your way through the old forest to Bree, and pass through Weathertop and Rivendell en route to Lothlorien and the final scene at Anduin. Unfortunately, this faithful pacing will prove a drawback for some players, as it limits your ability to explore and forces you from one location to the next. Once you've made your way to the next landmark, you can't go back. This creates the potential to leave important items behind, such that you may have to start over.  Worse yet, Fellowship of the Ring was shipped to retail with a number of software bugs present. Once in a while, you'll encounter enemies who won't attack you--you can just walk right through them. You can repeatedly enter and leave some areas to find duplicated items. A good example of this occurs after you meet Gildor. Off to the left, you'll find a house that constantly spawns gold pieces. While these glitches are unfortunate, they are at least helpful. As you continue playing, however, you'll encounter even more bugs, some of which are outright disastrous. There are two different areas where you'll experience a fatal crash that simply halts the game. One of these is avoidable, since it occurs during an optional side quest, but the other is not. About 80 percent into the game, deep in the mines of Moria, your game will just stop responding altogether, and you won't be able to play any further. Black Label Games has a workaround that involves pausing and saving your game right before you enter the problematic area, but it's not foolproof.  For the few brief hours that you can actually play the game, you're treated to a no-frills rendition of Middle-earth. Locations are brought to life accurately and with the necessary landmarks, but the overall color depth is minimal, and there's absolutely no animation present for minutiae like rivers, torches, or fog. Similarly, characters are faithful to their descriptions in the book, but they don't really move except to walk around or lunge during battle. The game's audio is equally plain. There are a few sound effects and a couple of digitized voices, but other than that, you won't hear very much at all. For whatever reason, the wonderful orchestral background music kicks in only at infrequent intervals.     Do yourself a favor and save the $30 you'd spend on this game. Despite whatever half-decent qualities this game might have, it ultimately butchers the story it's based on into a remarkably dull role-playing game--a game that you possibly won't even be able to finish.   "
730,Kirby's Epic Yarn,9.0,2,"In 2010, Kirby's Epic Yarn spun the traditional formula of Dream Land's favorite hero on its head, reimaging Kirby stuck in a world made entirely of yarn, buttons, and zippers. Extra Epic Yarn ports Kirby's sidescrolling platforming adventure from Wii to 3DS and stitches on a few new features and modes for good measure. Most of Extra Epic Yarn plays as you might remember the original game--and it still looks just as good--but the port's additions craft new, enjoyable ways for you to approach its content.Kirby does not have his trademark abilities in Patch Land, so you need to rely on his new knitted form to find unorthodox ways of overcoming obstacles and vanquishing foes. To attack, for example, Kirby throws out a whip of yarn to unravel enemies before wrapping the material up into a ball that can be thrown. There are also moments within levels where Kirby will take on a new shape, which briefly alters gameplay--when Kirby is a fighter jet, for example, Extra Epic Yarn becomes a fixed shooter.Epic Yarn recaptures the charming simplicity of Kirby's earliest adventures, while also reimagining Dream Land's hero in a fun new way with its yarn-based aesthetics. The game retains the franchise's focus on simple platforming challenges populated throughout cleverly designed levels as well. Extra Epic Yarn adds on to this formula by including craft-focused variations of some of Kirby's traditional transformations in the platforming sections. Certain items on each stage transform Kirby if you manage to whip them up, allowing him to attack and occasionally navigate a stage in a new way. For instance, Nylon (Tornado) Kirby can spin at high enough speeds to pull apart any enemy or damage bosses, but the attack can also be used to briefly hover through the air. These new abilities are not necessary to completing any level, but several of them allow Kirby to more easily attack and jump at the same time, which adds a nice flow to the platforming. And like previous Kirby titles, you can stick with one you enjoy and bring it from one stage to the next.It would have been nice to see Kirby's transformations inspire new puzzles in Extra Epic Yarn. Every stage--as far as I can tell--has been faithfully replicated, so there's not one puzzle you can't figure out without a transformation. It feels like a lost opportunity to implement a more creative application of Kirby's new powers.On top of new transformations, Extra Epic Yarn also adds Devilish mode, which is the game's version of a hard difficulty. In Devilish mode, a small devil will follow Kirby and try to attack him. Striking back will cause the devil to scurry off, but it will return eventually and you'll have to hit it again if you want to get rid of it. And you do want to get rid of it. Unlike Normal mode, Kirby can be unwound in Devilish mode from taking too many hits, which forces you to start a stage from the very beginning. Devilish mode can present quite the challenge on later stages, where longer levels present more opportunities for a misplaced jump or slow attack. The new mode never becomes frustrating, though, thanks in large part to the implementation of the aforementioned transformation abilities. Devilish mode might not have worked in the more methodical Epic Yarn, but the ability to do quick, sweeping attacks while on the move with Kirby's transformations allows for Extra Epic Yarn to be more action-oriented. It's still tough at times, but as someone who thought Epic Yarn was too easy, Devilish mode introduces the challenge I want in a second playthrough.Extra Epic Yarn also adds two new minigames which put you in control of either Meta Knight or King Dedede. Meta Knight Slash &amp; Bead has you cut your way through stages as you collect beads, doing your best to slice through as many enemies as quickly as possible to earn more time. Dedede Gogogo is a much faster-paced variation of the same formula, pushing you to sprint through a stage instead of fight your way through it. Each minigame only has four stages, all of which only last a few minutes. Both work as enjoyable distractions when you want to take a break from the campaign--similar to Samurai Kirby and Megaton Punch in previous titles.Epic Yarn recaptures the charming simplicity of Kirby's earliest adventures, while also reimagining Dream Land's hero in a fun new way with its craft-focused aesthetics.One last change that comes in Extra Epic Yarn is the loss of motion controls, which were used in certain story levels in the original game on Wii and Wii U. You only notice the motion controls are gone in a few infrequent instances: the sections where Kirby turns himself into a train. Before, you laid out the train's path by pointing at the screen and dragging where you wanted the track to go. In the 3DS port, you use the control stick or d-pad, which is just harder to do. It's possible, sure, but I can't help but think incorporating stylus support in those sections would have made them easier.Extra Epic Yarn brings new life to a Kirby game that's nearly a decade old. Everything there is to love about Epic Yarn is still here, but the addition of traditional transformation abilities and challenging Devilish mode provide options for anyone looking for a different or more difficult platforming experience. The two new minigames aren't game-changing additions, but they're both fun to complete and provide a change of pace if you ever need a break from the campaign. Whether you're looking to relive Kirby's adventure into Patch Land or want to pick up the game for the first time, Extra Epic Yarn provides hours of good fun, all wrapped up in charming, craft-influenced visuals. This 3DS port is the best version of the game, hands down."
2378,Pikmin 3,8.0,2,"  What would you do for a strawberry? When your life depends on the juice encased in this tasty fruit, the answers are as limitless as they are disturbing. Survival of the fittest is at the heart of Pikmin 3, and though the dangerous fauna cavorting about the environments are well equipped to fend off interlopers, those predators have no counter to a horde of scavengers ready to fight. And as you secure the bounty of your triumphs--avocados, melons, grapes--you feel not regret for what you had to do, but relief. This achingly cute adventure taxes your brain as much as your fingers, resulting in a satisfying journey through Darwinian conquest.        Crash-landing on a foreign planet, three explorers must do what they can to survive. When colorful beings approach Charlie, he blows his whistle in an attempt to chase them away. But that only draws them closer. Once surrounded, he tosses them to and fro, but instead of running away from this angry man, they happily chop down a nearby mushroom. And then he gets an idea. Why not use these diminutive creatures to his advantage? He can gain the attention of the pikmin by blowing his whistle, and then toss them near an object or enemy to set them to work. Through this delightful tutorial you learn the core mechanics and set off to find your two stranded comrades.      Charlie, along with his crewmates Alph and Brittany, is in search of a solution to save the inhabitants of their home planet from starvation. Much of your journey entails securing fruit that will sustain you for one more in-game day. Melons, lemons, and the like are scattered throughout the five enormous environments, and you have to be resourceful and persistent to collect enough to keep living. You consume one vial of juice per day (which lasts about 15 minutes), and you're free to stay on the planet for as long as you have fruit juice to keep you energized. In the early hours of the adventure, you're focused on nabbing as much fruit as your pikmin's tiny arms can carry. Once you have a healthy supply, however, your focus can shift to ship repair.                   Pikmin demanded efficiency because your adventure ended after just 30 days. And Pikmin 2 introduced caves, which taxed even the most hardened animal trainers.      Thankfully, if you venture outside of the story mode you can find serious challenges. Mission mode can be played alone or with a friend, and time is a quickly evaporating commodity. In these specially designed levels, you have to collect treasure, kill enemies, or vanquish bosses as quickly as possible, and your reward is a shiny badge. Planning how to scoop up all the fruit or slay the baddies without wasting a second requires the mind of a battle commander, and it's exhilarating to ensure all of your explorers are maximizing their potential as you inch closer and closer toward perfection. You may never collect every item or enemy, but slightly beating your previous best attempt is satisfying enough to keep bringing you back for more.        Bingo Battle is the final mode, and it's a chaotic excursion into competitive matches. In this two-player face-off, you try to complete one row of your bingo card before your friend can. Bring fallen enemies or delicious fruits back to your base as quickly as you can if you want to win. But winning is only a small part of the fun. The real joy comes from griefing your buddy. If you see that your opponent needs to collect just one lemon to win, do whatever you can to get that lemon yourself. And then look at the pain on your opponent's face as he or she sees what you just did. It's fantastic! This hectic mode is fast and unpredictable, and leads to tasteful trash-talking as you try desperately to one-up each other.      Pikmin 3 doesn't offer much growth from previous games in the series, and actually takes a step backward in some areas. But there's no shame in falling just short of the classic offerings that came before it. Scouring the environment for all of the hidden goodies is eminently enjoyable because of the clever problem solving you have to employ, and the competitive mode should test the strength of any friendship. There's nothing quite like Pikmin out there, and its delightful combination of survival strategy and unflinching cuteness should entertain you throughout this lengthy adventure.    "
815,Chasm,8.0,2,"As a recruit stationed in a castle far away from civilization, Chasm hints at a greater world just waiting to be explored. But after you're chosen to investigate the disturbances at a small village, it soon becomes clear the world's mysteries have to take a backseat to more pressing dangers. Journals uncovered as you explore the mines, temples, and jungles explain why evil beings are being summoned, but the story doesn't offer an interesting spin on a ho-hum premise. The little narrative appeal comes from the citizens you release from cages. Each person has their own tale to tell and errand for you to run, giving you someone to fight for as you eradicate the enemies.Thankfully, combat is the main draw of Chasm. Melee is the predominant manner of attack, and there are a wide variety of swords, hammers, knives, and other short-range weapons to find throughout the adventure. Fighting relies heavily on timing as you must learn the behaviors of each enemy to have a chance at survival. Wights, for example, lunge at you with a sweeping sword strike that can be avoided if you know what to expect but could spell your doom if you're too slow. The clear signs from every enemy ensure that it's your skill that determines fights and not cheap tactics.Once you learn an enemy's attack patterns, patience is often your toughest foe. Monsters can take a half dozen strikes or more to die, but just one mistake can drop your life bar down to nothing. Trying to get one more hit on a bouncing Grilla or boomerang-throwing skeleton can be a suicidal strategy. The enemies take advantage of even the tiniest mistake, and there's no worse feeling than dying because of your own hubris.The first half of Chasm offers a tough-but-fair challenge that is every bit as intense as you'd expect when there are demons and ghosts milling about. Save points are few and far between. Trekking across unknown places with little health makes every encounter agonizing in all the right ways. Even a mere bat--among the weakest of all video game enemies--can strike terror in your heart. I died more times than I'd like to admit from a swarm of flies when I got cocky that no insect would be the end of me. Whenever I came across a branching path, I would poke my nose in every new area, hoping that a save point would relieve me from the pressure. More often than not, there was an undead knight or green slime waiting, and I'd have to calm my nerves as I prepared for another life-or-death battle.Bosses pose a formidable threat during those early hours when you're still weak and inexperienced. Like normal enemies, bosses telegraph every attack, so it's on you if you take too many hits. The first boss in the game--a Wendigo who can become invisible and cling to the ceiling--killed me over and over again before I mastered its attack pattern. Finally tasting victory was incredibly fulfilling because I knew I earned the win, and I was eager to see what new challenges awaited.Chasm emphasizes the ""vania"" in Metroidvania, giving you experience points for every enemy you kill. There are dozens of weapons to collect and pieces of equipment to wear, so you can tailor your character to your playstyle. Like slow but powerful weapons? Grab an ax! Prefer quicker ones with less range? Go for a handy knife instead. In addition to melee weapons, there are also ranged items that use your magic meter. Hurl shuriken at faraway enemies or throw a Molotov cocktail to set the ground aflame. None of these are as satisfying to use as a sword, but they can be mighty handy when things become overwhelming and you need a little help to progress. There are also food and potions to stock up on if you're feeling acutely vexed by a particular enemy.All of these extra items, though, lead to an unbalanced difficulty as you get deeper into the adventure. Although I never set out to grind, I did backtrack frequently and killed every enemy I encountered as I retread the underground world. By the end of the game, I was so powerful and the enemies were so easy, I never felt threatened. I defeated the last two bosses on my first attempts, which would have seemed impossible after I struggled for hours to kill those early bosses. The last boss was so easy it was almost comical. I just stood underneath it, never bothering to avoid its many attacks, as I hacked and slashed at its glowing weak point. I had more than half my health left when it died and felt the dull ache that only an anticlimactic final fight can produce as I watched the credits roll.I did start again from the beginning, this time on Hard difficulty, but couldn't find that sweet spot I had been hoping for. Hard is, as you'd expect, hard. Not needlessly so, or even unfairly so, but harder than I could have endured as a novice. It's a real shame that the difficulty balance is so out of whack. I enjoyed playing every second of this game, even when I was killing enemies without breaking a sweat, mostly because the combat mechanics are so satisfying. But I missed that creeping danger from the early goings when I could die at any moment.The randomly generated levels also sound more impressive in theory than they are in practice. Yes, the layouts of the stages were different the second and third times I started over, but not so different that it felt like an entirely new adventure--the rooms were mostly the same, just located in slightly different positions. This isn't to say the random element is bad--my first time through was so fun that any extra incentive to start over again is appreciated--it's just not as noticeable a change as I was hoping.I'm a sucker for beautiful pixel art, and Chasm is bursting with rich backgrounds and well-realized enemies. It's the little details that make all the difference. The rats eagerly wag their tails as their sprint toward you, making them seem almost cute as you thud them hard on the back with a hammer. The human-sized Meatman is every bit as gross as his name implies, and it almost felt like a mercy kill when I struck it through its muscled heart with my sword. Every new creature brought with it its own delights, so I was happy that there are almost 90 different enemies to meet and kill.Even when its flaws are obvious, Chasm is a well-crafted adventure, and during the more than 12 hours I spent playing through my first time, I got lost only once. That's a huge bonus in a genre where getting lost is often the most frustrating aspect. Even after I finished, I was eager to venture forth on a new adventure, to test my combat mettle against harder foes and find the one secret that eluded me the first time through. It's a shame the randomization of the world isn't that big of a deal and the challenge could be better balanced, but the superb combat and visual design ensure your time with Chasm will be well spent. Editor's note: The review score has been updated to reflect the PlayStation 4 and Switch versions of Chasm. -- October 11, 2018, 7:50 AM PT "
1124,Call of Duty: Black Ops 3,8.0,2,"Chronicles has a strong foundation in its map selection--it includes smaller, more manageable maps like World at War's Nacht der Untoten alongside more complex, story-centric maps like Black Ops' Ascension. If you're new to Zombies, you can hone strategies on the simpler maps, and if you've been a fan of Treyarch's Zombies for a while, at least one of your favorites is here. There's also good variety in map structure and the strategies they each call for, from the more open Shi no Numa to the small, easily-overrun rooms of Verruckt.These maps are now better than ever thanks to the fantastic technical improvements. Atmospheric enhancements, from eerie screeches to subtle lighting changes, supplement the more straightforward graphics upgrade, and they make the same gripping, stay-up-all-night zombies rounds you remember feel fresh and modern. The most noticeable change, especially in the heat of the moment, is the enhanced audio--the horrible death rattle of a gunned-down zombie and the unearthly howling of the Hellhounds are grating in the best way. The guttural snarls behind you feel more urgent, and that translates to greater tension even on maps you played to death the first time around.Years-old strategies need a bit of tweaking thanks to the introduction of Black Ops 3's Zombies features, and which further help in keeping the classic maps from feeling stale. Gobblegum and its various perks, for example, are optional, but depending on what you get, you might play a map differently compared to the way you remember. The change-up works well for groups that have a mix of new and returning players, too, since it gives newcomers an opportunity to be a bit more involved in the plan instead of just following someone who's already routed the map.The Black Ops 3 features also work for newer players on their own, particularly those who started with Treyarch's most recent game. If you don't have the nostalgia going into Chronicles, small things like Gobblegum help to modernize the older, less-involved maps without overshadowing what made them favorites to begin with.Atmospheric enhancements make the same gripping, stay-up-all-night zombies rounds you remember feel fresh and modern.Chronicles also includes Black Ops 3 weapons, but they make very little difference in how you strategize--they're really just there to keep the collection in line with Treyarch's latest. It is nice to pick up the Kuda early on if you spent any time at all with Black Ops 3's multiplayer and want something a bit more familiar until you can get to the Mystery Box, but you'll still end up crossing your fingers and hoping for the Ray Gun anyway. Of course, that Ray Gun is as satisfying to fire as ever--it's just disappointing that the weapon additions are mostly fluff.Zombies Chronicles takes a good combination of maps and upgrades them with great attention to detail. Newer Zombies features keep the collection modern, but its greatest strength is in the lighting and audio upgrades, which make the Zombies experience that many fans obsessed over before feel creepier, more tense, and more exhilarating than ever."
4589,Hired Team Trial Gold,4.0,0,"Better late than never? Not where Hired Team: Trial Gold is concerned. This game, which despite its ambiguous title isn't a demo or time-limited shareware program, was originally released in Russia back in 2000 and has now finally seen the light of day in the US. If you're a shooter fan, you'll want to shove Hired Team back into a dark hole and forget about it. Hired Team is a shameless mishmash of Quake III: Arena and Unreal Tournament, two great games that helped redefine the shooter genre in 1999 with their focus on pure multiplayer carnage over single-player action. Even if Hired Team had been released back then, it would have been crushed by those illustrious, hugely popular competitors. It would have been too far behind the times in terms of both gameplay and technology back then, and it's doubly so today.  Like Quake III and Unreal Tournament, Hired Team technically has a story--a truly disposable one. It's the year 2064 and crime is out of control, so a new team of supersoldiers needs to be trained in virtual reality combat arenas. The ""Trial"" portion of Hired Team: Trial Gold is the equivalent of a single-player campaign, in which you work your way through progressively tougher levels, fighting with and against computer-controlled bots. Game modes include old standbys like deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and domination. You also get infiltration mode, a watered-down version of Unreal Tournament's assault mode, with just one simple objective: capture or defend a single flag. Playing these modes online against humans, bots, or a mix of the two is no easy task. The game's server browser either doesn't work, or there simply weren't any servers out there (the latter is a distinct possibility). Even when you're hosting a server, you should be ready for some lag.    Hired Team plays out in a motley assortment of arenas, including factories with industrial hazards, castles, and the now-obligatory neo-gothic cathedrals with cheesy heavy metal names like ""Halls of Suffering."" All told, you'll get 28 maps, which would be all well and good if only you could remember any of them five minutes after playing. For the most part, they're uninspired, unoriginal forays through terrain that every shooter fan has seen countless times before. Imagine third-rate, fan-created Quake II maps, and you'll get the idea. A few bounce pads, elevators, and vats of deadly goo are about all that the levels offer in the way of interactivity.    Hired Team's arsenal similarly works hard to prove that there's nothing new under the sun. You get a predictable assortment of boring weapons, like a pistol, a shotgun, a rocket launcher, a grenade launcher that works and sounds remarkably like that of Quake III, and so on. None of these have the alternate firing modes that make the weapons of Unreal Tournament so much fun, nor do they have the visceral power and colorful visuals of Quake III's weapons. They're also horribly unbalanced. The default pistol, for instance, is so wimpy as to be essentially worthless. Most all of the other weapons are grossly overpowered and can kill opponents almost instantly.    You'll find extra ammo scattered liberally and arbitrarily throughout the levels. The same goes for armor and health items. It's a shame there aren't more inventive items or even just the equivalent of something like Quake III's quad damage or Unreal Tournament's antigrav boots. Hired Team is so dull that it seems to desperately need that kind of variety.    When a shooter jettisons storytelling, scripted events, and the other trappings of single-player games to focus on pure combat, it needs to sweat the small stuff all the more. As in most departments, Hired Team falls far short where finer points like physics are concerned. Character movement speed is spot-on for a game of this type, neither too slow nor too frantically fast. On the other hand, the ""feel"" of the weapons, their apparent heft and strength, leaves lots to be desired, since you never get any sense of your weapons' power. You don't get any decent feedback on damage taken or doled out, either. You'll have to settle for a few generic groans when someone gets blasted. The fact that characters simply vanish when killed (in deference to the game's virtual reality back story) sure doesn't help matters.  Hired Team doesn't do nearly enough with its computer-controlled bot opponents, either. You'll fight a few boring-looking humanoid robots and a few humans with evocative names like Ron. You can select from four bot skill levels that affect their basic combat abilities but sure don't make up for their lack of smarts where coordinated games like capture-the-flag are concerned. You can issue commands to bots through a branching menu, but they seem to ignore your orders. Adding bots to an online game is a tedious chore, requiring you to select each one individually and assign its team manually.    As far as its presentation goes, Hired Team offers loads of fancy graphics configuration options. However, they don't matter, because the game's graphics engine can't compete with today's shooters built around the Quake III, Unreal, or Serious Sam engine. A lack of technical polish could have been overcome with artistic imagination and skill, but Hired Team adamantly refuses to offer that. Instead, the game has ugly weapon and character models and boxy maps gratuitously filled with garish lights and mirrored textures like some futuristic disco. The game's sparse, amateurish sound effects similarly fall well short of the mark.    Hired Team: Trial Gold has arrived at about the worst possible time. It's a budget-priced game, retailing for around $20, but these days you can buy Quake III or Unreal Tournament for about that price. With either of those, you'll get a vastly better game served by a huge mod community. What's more, Unreal Tournament 2003 is just around the corner, which is sure to make Hired Team: Trial Gold look that much more like the uninspired, antiquated, and poorly designed copycat it is."
4191,The Sims Carnival: SnapCity,4.0,0,"  Sometimes, two unique flavors belong together, like peanut butter and bananas, or bacon and anything. Other flavors, like pickles and chocolate, are best left separated. And so we have The Sims Carnival: SnapCity, a little title that combines Tetris and SimCity into a weird casserole of boring, half-baked gameplay mechanics that will disappoint fans of either of those classics. Like a horseradish milkshake or herring cream pie, it's a curiosity you should leave others to experience.         SnapCity is incredibly easy to play, but it's hard to wrap your head around, at least initially. As in Tetris, various geometric shapes fall from above, only in this case, they fall toward a three-dimensional grid rather than a simple 2D plane. The catch is that these shapes come in three different hues, which represent the standard SimCity building zones: yellow for industrial, blue for commercial, and green for residential. Your goal is to fit these pieces together into larger areas, which will cause corresponding structures to spring forth. As in any standard city builder, you then must connect your zones with roads with a few mouse clicks, and traffic will begin to flow between them.      It's a fascinating concoction indeed, though neither the block-fitting mechanic nor the city building itself offers up any degree of challenge. Thankfully, there is a little more to do. Occasionally, a disaster like a tornado or a riot will wreak havoc, and you need to click and hold the right mouse button over the event to bring it to a halt. As you play, you will fill a meter on the left side of the screen that when full will produce a ""puzzle"" zone; when filled with blocks of the same color, that zone will allow you to construct a special building, like a police station or a military base. These buildings offer bonuses like increased revenue or the ability to plant trees, or might help you deal more quickly with disasters. Yet don't be fooled: While they may be called puzzle zones, there's nothing remotely puzzling or otherwise tricky about ""solving"" them. Just drop blocks in them.     You'd think that a game based on two of the most addicting formulas ever created would be engaging, and while it can be interesting for five or 10 minutes, SnapCity is dreadfully boring. The better way to play is in creativity mode, where you can spread your city across the grid, sandbox style. The story mode gives you specific objectives, like building a police station while fighting crime, or constructing enough roads to keep your buildings from decaying. However, it's practically impossible to fail these challenges, even if you push up the difficulty slider. You can return to them to try to beat your previous time, but the whole experience is so bland it's hard to imagine anyone wanting to. The production values certainly won't keep your eyes glued to the screen. The visuals are colorful but extremely simple, there is very little variety to the buildings, and you can't even rotate the game grid. The accompanying sound effects are nondescript but appropriate, but the soundtrack is a repetitive collection of low-quality MIDI tunes that will have you looking for the mute option in the game menus.      SnapCity is a neat concept, but in practice, it's dreadfully boring. Like an anchovy enchilada, it's an interesting idea that just didn't work out.     "
3517,Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11,8.0,2,"              Most of the feature set here is very similar to that found in Tiger Woods 10. All of the Career, Season, and multiplayer modes (multiplayer crowds are a little sparse right now, which is odd considering the number of tournament events that EA is sponsoring and how last year's game had such a big online following) have returned. Nifty party games have also returned, like disc golf, which is now available online and off. Career play remains a bit frustrating in the beginning because you need to do some grinding in the skills competitions to get your pathetic starter stats to where they need to be to truly compete on the tour. A couple of dozen familiar pros and novelty characters still make up the standard roster of pros you can take onto the greens. Five new courses have been added in the likes of the Twenty Ten Course at Celtic Manor, Whistling Straits, The Old White Course at the historic Greenbrier, and the tropical fantasy course Predator, making for a total of 28. But four have been dropped, too, including Firestone and Riviera. Visuals and audio have been ported over from last year virtually intact. So courses are still a little rough and ready, with lots of jaggies and a lack of definition, especially when it comes to looking a couple of hundred yards down a fairway. As for the sound, the commentators still spew a few too many insults based on your performance and the music is really Muzak, although the thunk of a club hitting a ball continues to be very satisfying.       "
4226,Conflict Zone,4.0,0,"Conflict Zone is a modern-day military real-time strategy game that has a unique resource system. It also touts its advanced artificial intelligence. The enemy is supposed to react to your actions in different ways every time, and you can have computer-controlled commanders help you in battles. It all sounds great in theory, but in practice, you'll find the AI only sporadically makes intelligent moves. Conflict Zone has a number of other problems, too. When the first wave of frustration passes, you'll realize that Conflict Zone is a subpar RTS game whose few good ideas just don't add up.   Conflict Zone is the stage for a war between the International Corps for Peace (ICP), a peacekeeping force like NATO, and GHOST, a secret self-serving group of nations. You can choose to play as either side in both the campaign and skirmish missions. Both sides are presented fairly well in the campaign missions, and the story is told through mildly amusing cutscenes. But while the ICP and GHOST are ideologically different, they are almost identical in terms of units and structures. The ICP scenarios are mostly peacekeeping missions in which you have to rescue civilians and then eliminate GHOST forces. These get so repetitive that, before each mission, you'll start to feel as if you're getting ready to go to work again on Monday morning after the weekend. The GHOST missions are a bit better because less emphasis is placed on rescuing civilians. It sounds boring that both sides have the same units, and it is. When playing a skirmish map, you might as well flip a coin because it basically doesn't matter which side you're on. Actually, that's not entirely true--the ICP and GHOST take slightly different approaches with regard to civilians and the media.   The resource model in Conflict Zone is interesting and unique. One of your resources is ""popularity."" It determines what level of units and technology you possess at any given moment. It's supposed to represent the trust that your leaders have in you, so a higher popularity means that they'll let you have bombers and submarines. The media directly influences your popularity by observing the actions you make in the game.   Popularity is the biggest differentiating factor between the ICP and GHOST. The ICP is able to increase popularity to high levels quickly simply by rescuing civilians and taking them to a refugee camp in their base. The downside to this is that the ICP also loses popularity quite easily. First, people generally don't like long wars, so the ICP's popularity slowly decreases over time. Next, if your forces suffer humiliating losses, the people back home aren't going to like you. Lastly, lots of civilian deaths at your hand will bring down your popularity big-time. A few civilian deaths are acceptable, though. But you're still going to have to avoid many battles near towns, because explosives have area-effect damage that can cause civilian casualties easily. And town buildings resupply civilians, so you don't want those destroyed.   Raising the GHOST's popularity takes more work than raising the ICP's popularity. Instead of a refugee camp, you have an enlistment camp. When you bring civilians there, they are converted to a random infantry unit on your side. This will raise your popularity to 50 percent, but no higher. As a mercenary general, you have to impress the GHOST leaders with favorable footage of successful battles. You can recruit cameramen to follow your troops. But if you're routed in combat, expect popularity to drop.   The main resources you get are command points. While the popularity resource is interesting, the command point system is frustrating. It seems to take forever to gain enough command points to build a decent-sized force. Granted, some waiting is involved in just about all RTS games, but Conflict Zone takes this to extremes. You can increase the rate of command point acquisition through rescuing civilians, but most of the time, they're behind enemy lines. And there are not many structures in the game, so building your base won't take much time at all. Therefore, you're going to just sit there twiddling your thumbs until you have collected enough command points to build troops. It's perfectly viable to get up and brew a cup of coffee or watch TV for a while and then come back to the game. The computer will rarely attack your base with a threatening force, so you don't have to worry about that. The command point system gets even worse in skirmish mode. All the combatants will get command points at a relatively equal rate, so there's no way to disrupt an opponent's economy. This means that there will be a lot of stalemates unless someone makes a really bad mistake.   The gameplay doesn't make up for the poor resource model. You're supposed to be able to make diversionary strikes at enemy forces, causing the enemy to reinforce that area and leave another area largely undefended. This works only once in a while, so you're back to the basic RTS ideal of winning by squatting in your base until you have enough troops to completely overwhelm the enemy positions. Infantry are largely useless because they die so quickly and move slow compared with vehicles. Since explosions will kill an infantryman instantly and infantry usually clump together, one tank shell or bazooka shot will send bodies flying. It leaves you to wonder why you can build a medic to heal injured troops, since troops never seem to survive more than a single hit.  Vehicles are much more useful because they take more of a beating before being destroyed; plus, you can repair them. Your main attack force is almost always going to be tanks and antiair defenses. Initially, the only infantry unit you'll ever want to build is the bazooka because it can fire at enemy aircraft, but even it soon outlives its usefulness since you'll gain antiair vehicles. So you'll learn to ignore infantry altogether. You're told that marines are good for sweeping towns because they won't accidentally kill civilians with splash damage, but in practice, you're better off just using vehicles--not caring if a few civilians die and not caring if you lose some popularity points. As long as you have enough to build tanks, you're fine.   The unit artificial intelligence is decent at best. Since units can't absorb much damage in Conflict Zone, there's no reason to concentrate fire on a single unit. The game does a good job with having units spread their fire on enemy groups. Your units will also fire while moving, which is a stress reliever in RTS games. On the other hand, unit pathfinding has some issues. Your units will eventually get to any point on the map, but they don't get there efficiently, much to your detriment. The biggest obstacles are bridges and ramps leading to elevation changes. Your groups can't seem to tackle these without getting slaughtered. The scale shows that five infantry and a couple of tanks can easily cross abreast of each other, yet they all insist on going single-file through these locations. Anyone can see the obvious choke points that result. There also aren't any formations to protect weaker units such as artillery and antiair troops. A group won't move at the rate of the slowest member. If your advancing tank column runs ahead and gets taken out, then you're going to have to retreat everything else that lagged behind. This is yet another reason why infantry are more trouble than they're worth. Some skirmish maps also place bases in areas where your army simply refuses to go. It appears to be impossible to win these scenarios with armies, so the last person to quit is the victor.   Conflict Zone includes up to four AI-controlled battle commanders per side that can assist you in combat. You can have them handle a variety of tasks such as improving your base, attacking or defending a position, and concentrating on rescuing civilians. The latter is probably the only option that's really useful. Rescuing civilians is a tedious task, and if someone else is willing to do it for you, more power to them. You can share resources with commanders and give them units to control on their own. But sharing command points means that you'll have to wait even longer to build a force. Now, you can do errands while they build up your base and a bunch of units. But by then, what's the point of playing the game in the first place? The commanders do have their fair share of problems. Sometimes they will refuse to build anything and just sit there collecting money. Perhaps it's a testament to the advanced AI in the game--as in the movie War Games, perhaps the computer is simply realizing that it's a part of a fruitless game.   The games' 3D graphics are utilitarian: They do the job but aren't anything to write home about. Unit models are bland, but they hold up well when you're zoomed in close. Yet another problem with infantry is that they are quite small when you're zoomed out, which is the view that a typical strategy gamer has to use to get a full scope of the battlefield. It's so bad that you can't even tell the difference between a cow and an enemy marine without floating your mouse over it first.   On the other hand, Conflict Zone's interface is nonobtrusive and works well enough. When you select a group of units, you're told the types and number you have selected on the left-hand side of the screen. You have a minimap in the top right-hand corner that expands when you float your mouse pointer over it. The only other main interface feature is the build menu in the bottom left. It's real easy to cycle through and build anything you want. You don't even have to select a factory-type building to buy units. The camera is done fairly well, but you can only use the mouse at the edge of the screen to adjust the perspective. There are other strategy games that let you hold down the buttons and move the mouse to rotate and elevate the camera--it's too bad that this wasn't implemented.   Conflict Zone isn't a completely terrible game, but there's nothing about it that will scream for you to play it. Most mainstream strategy gamers will most likely find it painful to play. Besides, this is a great time for strategy games, so Conflict Zone's fierce competition makes it even less recommendable. And if Conflict Zone's AI even gives up, then perhaps it's trying to tell you something. Hard-core strategy gamers might find something to like in the game's unusual resource system. But not even that and the game's cheap price of $19.99 justifies a purchase. You can easily pick up older games that look and play better than Conflict Zone. "
951,Pit People,7.0,2,"At a glance, Pit People looks like a simplified tactical game, and in many ways that’s true. But what sets it apart from the norm is the relationship between your position on a battlefield and the automatic action you’ll take once you move to a new location. Land on a tile touching an enemy, and you’ll attack them as expected. But land on a tile touching two enemies and your character will pick and choose which to attack on their own. Likewise, you need to be extra careful when lining up a ranged attack lest you automatically attack an inadvertent target nearby.At first, this makes the game feel too limited for real strategic planning. Over time, though, these restrictions come to inspire foresight and creativity. The moment one of your characters splits from the pack, they're likely to be ganged up on, and premeditated blocking and baiting become important. Most characters (including your own fighters) have a lot of health and take many hits to down, so figuring out how to do the most damage while preserving yourself can be tricky. Some characters perform area-of-effect attacks that can also damage allies, so if you put a teammate between an archer and their target they might accidentally hit them with an arrow. Pit People may have distilled the logistics of the turn-based strategy purely to placement, but there's still plenty of thought required. It's not up there with the heavyweights of the genre--this simplified system makes the game easier to get into, but there are never really instances where you need to craft a grand, clever strategy that requires thinking ahead more than a couple of moves.The way you build your team is the game's smartest hook. If a character can be armed with specific gear (which applies to most human classes), you can have them forego any sort of shield and instead give them a net. During combat, the net can be thrown from two spaces away to bind an enemy to their space for the next turn, but when there's only one enemy left on the field, you can hurl your net to recruit them, adding them to the list of characters you can control. It's the same hook that made Pokémon so big (it's surely no mistake that your team has six slots), and trying to keep the most enticing member of the enemy party alive so you can capture them at the end of the fight adds an interesting wrinkle to the campaign.There are several different kinds of units, and while their attacks and abilities can be modified with a variety of equipment, they all serve specific functions--archers attack from long range, cupcakes can heal but can't attack, mushrooms can spray poisonous clouds, and so on. But capturing isn't just restricted to standard enemies, either--if you can defeat all a boss character's underlings, you can recruit characters who play a part in the game's story. The character designs are as cartoonish and fun as The Behemoth's characters have always been, with lots of gross-looking monsters and weird takes on standard RPG classes, which makes recruiting as many of them as you can more compelling--even if, at a certain point, it sinks in that you'll probably never use most of your under-levelled recruits.According to one of the game's loading screen tips, you can recruit over 500 units. At its core, Pit People is a collect-a-thon--the campaign is brief, and the moment you finish it, the missions start cycling again from the beginning (there are a heap of optional side-missions too, which are mostly good fun). The true goal of the game is to build up your army, level up your best units, collect the best loot from battles, and then take it all into the titular Pit, a combat arena where you can either face waves of AI or fight opponents online. A lot of the loot is purely cosmetic, which makes the grind a bit less interesting than it could be, but putting together a team and taking them online to see how they fare is an interesting experience.Unfortunately, the lobbies have been quiet since the game's 1.0 launch, and finding people to play against has been difficult. This is a shame--the competitive multiplayer is a fun addition. The whole game can be played cooperatively too, online or off, which means fighting with two teams against double the enemy count in each mission. Because characters tend to lack passive support roles, it's not a game where playing with a friend will necessarily enhance your experience, but it's a nice option to have and doesn't detract from the game in any significant way either.Pit People is a fun take on the turn-based strategy genre, even if it's not the deepest out there. Building an army with the recruitment mechanics is great fun, and pulling off a difficult victory is always rewarding, especially when you manage to scrape through with only a single, battered unit left. On that note, a quick word of warning--do not start the game with permadeath enabled, no matter what your usual predilection in this genre is. If you lose certain characters that you need to take on story missions, you simply won't be able to finish the game, and while you can restart a battle (most of the time--one mission ended with my entire team spontaneously exploding, the game autosaving before I properly realised what had happened), getting through a match with no losses is difficult.This would be acceptable--you’re signing up for a more difficult experience, after all--but it also renders the Pit all but unusable. Getting through a match against the AI or an online opponent unscathed is essentially impossible, making this an even more hardcore option than it usually would be within this genre. It’s not just that the permadeath mode is unbalanced--it essentially locks you out of certain modes, which is not clear from the beginning, and because of existing genre conventions it’s fair to assume that some players will go in expecting permadeath to be the ‘right’ way to play. Follow this advice: let your characters come back when they die, and you'll be okay.Pit People's irreverent appeal isn't enough to make it stand alongside the greats, but it's entertaining and mildly engrossing. It maintains the cartoonish charm that The Behemoth always imbues their games with, and the gameplay cycle does a solid job of getting you invested in your scrappy team of fighters. Hopefully, over time, Pit People will build more of an audience and the online modes will improve, but even if you prefer to just stick to the single-player campaign, it's a fun time."
3596,Bionicle Heroes,5.0,1,"  In a perfect world, everyone everywhere will pay due homage to the supremacy of maniacal, gun-toting robots. Unfortunately, this world is not perfect. Bionicle Heroes, Traveller's Tales' latest game featuring the Lego license, does not do justice to its premise. In fact, Traveller's Tales seems to have given Bionicle Heroes no thought at all. The game's core mechanics closely mimic, if not straight up replicate, those found in the company's recent Lego Star Wars hits. Less-than-innovative mechanics not withstanding, the mind-numbingly simplistic and repetitive gameplay, as well as a dearth of worthwhile added content, means you'll have experienced everything this game has to offer by the end of the first stage.        Playing out over the course of several books, comics, and movies, the Bionicle Lego story enjoys an ever-growing library of source material. And if you're familiar with the lore, you'll know that Bionicle Heroes mostly follows the Bionicle Legends story arc. However, if the Bionicle name is new to you, you'll have the stage set by a brief narration at the beginning of the game. And that's about it. Because the only other ""voice talent"" you'll hear throughout the rest of the game is a few grunts from the menacing yet simple-minded enemy Piraka in cutscenes, you'll be left to infer what exactly is going on. So here's the gist. You arrive on the island of Voya Nui in an elongated tube, where some weird little robot kid hooks you up with these masks that give you elemental powers. From there, you'll need to enter six element-themed zones--forest, ice, fire, and so on--defeat the six evil Piraka, and recover the Mask of Light. There's also some kind of parasitic golden banana peel thrown into the mix, most likely for good measure.      How you interact with Bionicle Heroes is nearly identical to Traveller's Tales' other Lego series, Lego Star Wars. You'll run around a linear environment, exploding Lego pieces and enemies into a burst of smaller Lego pieces of varying point totals. These totals range from 10 to 250, which you'll then be able to spend on upgrades and unlockables in the cantina, err, Matoran Enclave. You'll find even more of these Lego pieces with the help of each character's individual elemental power, which looks exactly like the Force and behaves similarly to constructing in LSW. Along the way, you'll also collect gold and silver Toa canisters, with some being inaccessible until you go back through the level after you've upgraded your robot. By finding enough of these canisters, as well as passing zones and bashing bosses, you'll be able to visit a trophy room, where you can read up on gaps in the story. But by the time you've aggregated enough tidbits of information for the story to become semicoherent, you'll probably be past caring and will wish that you'd just read the books.      Aside from the plot holes, the major problem with Bionicle Heroes is its dull, repetitive gameplay. Heroes is so dull precisely because of the game's core feature. Hero mode activates once you've picked up a certain number of Lego pieces. When in hero mode, you are completely invincible to all damage, and this invulnerability lasts until you activate a giant golden statue to access the next area of any given level. By being even remotely selective with how you pick up Lego pieces, you'll be invincible a good two-thirds to three-fourths of the game, which means that nearly every situation before a boss battle is utterly trivialized. And on the off chance that you do die, you'll simply lose your currently equipped mask and receive a full bar of health. Replacement masks can be found around every corner, but because they're rarely needed and picking one up switches you to that character, they're more of an escalating annoyance than a life-saving necessity. Also, boss fights are unbearably predictable. You'll face a boss after the first, third, and fourth stages of each zone. In these fights, you'll invariably kill a bunch of minions to max out your hero meter; activate a conveniently located golden statue to do damage to the invincible boss; rinse-wash-repeat until the boss is down to a few hearts of health; then, while the boss is only mostly invincible, circle-strafe and shoot until it keels over. The one exception to this is in a stage where you face off against a boss and hordes of enemies...while you're in hero mode. Imagine, if you will, the consequences of an invincible being and a mostly invincible being coming to blows. It's not as exciting as you might think. If you add in combat that entails simply holding down the strafe and shooting buttons, as well as a shoot-it-until-it's-dead ethos and a brain-dead autotargeting system, you've got a truly mind-numbing, unsatisfying experience.     Much like Lego Star Wars, Bionicle Heroes has a quirky sense of humor that occasionally shines through the drudgery. You'll get a glimpse of this in the cutscenes, but most of it will come by way of the unlockable content found in the Piraka Playground. Here you'll find all of the Piraka that have been defeated in the stages, and now that they're no longer harassing the fine folk off Voya Nui island, they're free to build sand castles and engage in other tomfoolery. These scenes are pretty funny the first time or so, but they're rather short and don't hold any lasting appeal. You'll also find three bonus stages, which are two-minute missions to see how many of a certain underling robot you can kill. These aren't particularly enjoyable, but they are a nice way to round out a few of the ""kill this many"" achievements in the Xbox 360 version. Speaking of achievements, getting the full 1,000 achievement points out of Bionicle Heroes will require two full play-throughs, though you can get about 900 in one go. Aside from that, there is no multiplayer co-op or battle mode. A battle mode would have gone a long way in extending the value here, especially because slugging it out against another player with the six different elemental powers could potentially be pretty neat. What's also missing that might have been worthwhile is a build-your-own-Bionicle mode, playing off the Lego theme.        The vast majority of the game's budget was clearly funneled into the visual department; thus, the game does look fairly good. The various environments are well detailed, albeit stereotypical in their elemental themes, and fire and other explosion effects look particularly good. The Bionicles themselves animate well and have a shiny robotic luster, but you won't see any kind of damage modeling or other advanced effects. Effort was made to capitalize on the Xbox 360's technical capabilities, by way of high dynamic range bloom lighting, as well as depth of field and motion blur options. Unfortunately, the bloom lighting is often overdone to the point of being an eyesore. The depth and blurring effects also just muddy up the presentation. Luckily, the latter two can be turned off, which you'll probably want to do. You'll also find these effects in the PC version, but they look much cleaner, so the PC version looks the best. For the most part, the game performs well on all systems, even with numerous enemies and explosions onscreen. The frame rate will occasionally drag during some of the latter boss-fight sequences, though. Unfortunately, the musical score here will have you searching for your own self-destruct button. Because you'll be in hero mode for the vast majority of the game, and hero mode has a track that trumps the music of any stage, you'll be listening to the same Indiana Jones-inspired tune looped ad nauseam. However, many of the other arrangements that you'll occasionally hear aren't exactly a pleasant alternative, such as the cacophony produced by a French horn and electric guitar mash-up. Thankfully, you'll be able to turn these, as well as the sound effects, down or off.      Bionicle Heroes is without a doubt aimed at kids and is as E10+ as a shooter can get, but even a child will quickly grow bored by the lack of challenge, innovation, and story development in this game. The blatant similarities to the Lego Star Wars series are also troubling because they often leave you with the feeling that you're playing a retextured version of those games. Although the game does have bursts of inspiration in the charm of the cutscenes, these are spread entirely too thin and don't come close to carrying the package or making up for the disappointing gameplay. Those who enjoy the Bionicle storyline will most likely have an easier time looking past this game's flaws, but if you're looking for a fun and engaging game, definitely pass on this one.    "
2213,League of Legends,9.0,2,"  The gold can be spent at the shop at each team's respective base in order to purchase items like the appropriately named B. F. Sword (a big freakin' sword), or its mage-friendly counterpart, the Needlessly Large Rod. Once you're appropriately equipped, your goal shifts from slaughtering the endless waves of minions to pushing your army down the lanes by destroying the towers. Of course, your enemies won't stand idly by and watch you destroy them. League of Legends erupts in beautiful savagery once the teams of five group and fight as a unified force. As the two teams engage one another in a semi-chaotic brawl, players dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge skill-shots and target abilities in order to survive and kill the opposition. Team fights can make or break a match, as victory in a single battle means there will be no resistance to the siege of towers for some time. Trailing teams may attempt to turtle around a tower in order to use its power to make up for their weakness, and then mount a defense that turns the tides of battle into an epic comeback.    Every match is a challenge, and with over 100 champions to choose from, there are countless ways for a team to overcome it. Whether your style involves dropping a flaming bear on the opposition to stun them all, flying in as a frozen phoenix to summon a wall of ice and cut off a path of retreat, or slashing through minions in a fit of undying barbaric rage, League of Legends has you covered. Champion designs draw influence from regional legends and mythology, though others are Riot's own unique creations. Although most can be categorized as a role-playing archetype (mage, marksman, assassin, tank, fighter, or support), some champions blend two or more archetypes and allow you flexibility in how to play.   To keep you invested in the game, Riot allows you to unlock champions permanently using influence points (earned by playing matches in the game) or Riot points (purchased with real money). Riot points can also be spent on boosts to increase IP gain, but the most common reason you may end up purchasing RP is to unlock skins. The pricier skin options also tweak champions' animations, spell effects, and even voice-overs in the case of legendary and ultimate skins. Skins have no actual effect on a champion's combat ability, so spending money on the game doesn't offer any actual gameplay advantage. Don't be fooled by the free-to-play moniker, though: you might eventually find a skin that finally convinces you to pay to support the game, and soon find yourself staring at a vast library of looks.   If you don't find the initial Summoner's Rift map appealing, you'll be glad for the other vibrant battlefields on offer. Crystal Scar, Twisted Treeline, and Howling Abyss maps each stamp League of Legends with their own unique marks. Crystal Scar is a five-versus-five map with a focus on capturing territories in order to damage the opponent's nexus. Twisted Treeline plays mostly like Summoner's Rift, but with a limit of three players per team. And Howling Abyss, affectionately dubbed ""Murderbridge"" by the community, pits teams against one another in a single lane, with the queue for that map randomly selecting an available character to assign to each player in the game mode referred to as ""ARAM"" (short for ""all random, all mid"").  Differences between League of Legends and Dota highlight LoL's focus on a cleaner learning curve for new players as well as the (normally) healthy competitive environment. The unintuitive mechanic of denying, in which you kill a minion or tower on your own team so that the opposition may not earn gold, does not exist. Although this slightly reduces the control you have over the lane and where minions meet, it also frees you up to focus more on interacting with the opposing champions, rather than with the minions. Additionally, randomized elements, such as a chance to do anything (critical hits excepted) have been removed from League of Legends, ensuring you have a greater ability to predict the outcome of a given situation.

565,Kingdom Hearts III,4.0,0,"Kingdom Hearts 3 Re:Mind's title doesn't lie. It's more of an addendum to Kingdom Hearts 3 than a meaningful addition. In some ways, it's fitting that a franchise as labyrinthine as Kingdom Hearts received such a strange expansion. Re:Mind is a brief but laborious retread of events we already experienced last year, dressed up with new details that only make the already maddeningly elaborate story all the more obtuse. The DLC also brings back Replica Data bosses, which provide a ridiculous challenge that requires inordinate level grinding. [Editor's note: This review contains spoilers for the ending boss and area in Kingdom Hearts 3.] Kingdom Hearts 3 ended with Sora going off on his own to search for Kairi. Re:Mind takes you on that quest in typical Kingdom Hearts fashion: neither simply nor cleanly. It runs synchronously with the events at the Keyblade Graveyard, meaning you actually have to replay the climax again from the Keyblade Graveyard maze all the way to the showdown with Xehanort. Though the explanation for how this is possible is very silly, Re:Mind is essentially a director's cut.As a reminder, the Keyblade Graveyard doesn't really feature any exploration. It's a series of boss fights separated by lengthy cutscenes. Luxord still hides behind a playing card taunting Sora, and cutscenes stop the action in similar spots. Some of the dialogue and cutscenes are reworked while others are new, but the biggest difference is the option to play as Riku, Roxas, Kairi, or Aqua in several fights. Unfortunately, playing as these characters actually makes the slick and stylish combat less fun. All of them feel like weaker versions of Sora with limited movesets, and it also doesn't help that the Keyblade Graveyard itself is the blandest world in Kingdom Hearts 3, devoid of the colorful and pleasant trappings of the Disney worlds that made the majority of original campaign hum.Even the new content that's spliced into the repeated events largely fails to make the journey worthwhile. Scala ad Caelum opens up to reveal a new section before you square off against Xehanort. Though the area is fairly big, it's desolate and exists only as a space to complete a rather banal fetch quest. It's filler content in a story filled with recycled fights. There's a fan service sequence that's actually pretty enjoyable, however. Without spoiling it, it's the type of scene that will make fans fondly remember the decades-long journey that brought us to this point. It's a brief event that doesn't make up for five hours of deja vu, but it still stands out.For die-hard fans, the Limit Cut Episode that unlocks after watching the same closing cutscene from the base game is the meat of the package. Those who played Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix will be familiar with the mode, which sees Sora in a computer simulation fighting data versions of Organization XIII members like Xigbar, Ansem, and Xehanort. It even features cameos from the long-lost Final Fantasy characters.Unfortunately, the barrier for entry is extraordinarily high, because Limit Cut bosses are exponentially more challenging than any of the fights in the base game. If you didn't grind near or all the way to the level 99 cap in the main campaign--and there was no need to--Limit Cut will probably feel like an insurmountable challenge. I'm still working my way through the bosses, and I seriously doubt that I'll ever actually beat them all. The ocean that exists between the difficulty of the base game and the data bosses is jarring.It's of course impossible to separate the DLC from the game it builds off of, and Kingdom Hearts 3's best moments came in the Disney and Pixar worlds--the individual stories of friendship and love and good conquering evil that could almost be appreciated as self-contained short stories. Re:Mind seeks to tell a very specific story, but along the way it becomes blindingly clear that Kingdom Hearts' strengths lie in its pieces and parts, not its convoluted sum that threads through and disrupts the franchise's magical moments.Even as a longtime fan of the series who adored Kingdom Hearts 3, it's hard to muster up any sort of enthusiasm for Re:Mind. What's more, Re:Mind made me understand Kingdom Hearts 3's story even less, which is a testament to how bonkers it really is. It's not all that surprising this happened; after all, it's Kingdom Hearts. Nevertheless, Re:Mind is an incredibly peculiar expansion that simultaneously falls flat and partially obscures the brilliance of Kingdom Hearts 3."
1110,Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy: The Telltale Series,7.0,2,"Telltale's Guardians of the Galaxy series slows down with Episode 2. After an action-packed first episode, the second's slower pace leaves room for more substantial character moments. On occasion, however, that space is filled with manufactured drama, as key decisions revolve around playing favorites with the Guardians in a way that comes off as petty high school drama instead of the culmination of natural tension among the group. Fortunately, there's enough mystery in the story to carry the episode through to its to-be-continued ending, drama and all.Most of the episode consists of point-and-click exploration and conversations with less of a focus on Telltale-style quick-time events. Compared to the cinematic first episode, in which the game-y elements felt like interruptions, this episode flows a lot better, albeit more slowly. The few quick-time sequences that are present don't feel like the game is checking in to make sure you're paying attention, and it flows between conversations and exploration well.The Guardians are left reeling after the events of the first episode. Their next step is to learn more about the Eternity Forge, a relic in their possession that has the power to resurrect the dead. It's a strange enough artifact to drive the story forward without much action--it gave Peter visions of his long-dead mother, and he's not the only one who has someone they'd want to bring back to life. The first big decision involves either hunting down Gamora's highly dangerous sister, Nebula, so she can translate runes on the Eternity Forge, or going on a side mission with Rocket to see if he can bring back someone he's lost.It's the only decision in the episode that's at all difficult. I repeatedly sided with Gamora in the first episode and chose to go with Rocket in the second, even though Nebula was definitely going to do a bit of murdering before we could catch up to her. Gamora's disapproving gaze is very cutting, but Rocket's story is worth exploring and makes him a much more sympathetic character than in the previous episode. (It also involves an adorable anthropomorphic otter.)After that, though, the episode relies heavily on easy-to-avoid drama to fill the gaps between points of interest. I ended up siding with Gamora about something later, which upset Drax, since I'd picked Gamora over him before--but since Drax mostly just supplies comedic relief and promises to fight his way through any problem, going with the level-headed Gamora is an obvious choice, especially when it involves her sister. Talking to a mopey Drax is kind of like dealing with a five-year-old and doesn't make for the most interesting conversations, either.That said, I was more curious about the mysteries of the Eternity Forge and my companions' backstories this time around than I was with the first instalment--even though the drama often feels forced, there's substance to each character that's given a chance to shine this episode. The prospect of resurrection gives everyone an opportunity to show more emotion, and Gamora and Nebula's conversation in particular is both important and interesting to participate in.Even though the drama often feels forced, there's substance to each character that's given a chance to shine this episode.Small technical hiccups break up the flow, though. The facial animations are inconsistent and don't always sync neatly with dialogue, and I had to restart a sequence because an important prompt never appeared and stopped progression. It's less an issue of performance than polish, but it interrupts the already slow pace of the episode.By the ending cliffhanger, Guardians creates enough of a mystery with the Eternity Forge--specifically the process and cost of using it--to segue into the next episode. Emotions run high, and that works well for Rocket's story as well as the conflict between Gamora and Nebula, but other pivotal choices seem like overblown drama between kids instead of a ragtag band of heroes. It lacks action and big reveals, but it sets up a lot of different avenues to potentially explore down the line."
1300,Bound,7.0,2,"Bound speaks the language of games, but it’s only vaguely interested in fluency. It reproduces the basic elements in grand, abstract, poetic flourishes. Even the simple act of pressing the jump button creates a symphony of balletic movements from our brave heroine. Bound is less focused on presenting a series of challenges than it is in letting players participate in an interactive modern-dance performance.The story of this particular libretto? A princess is tasked by her mother, the queen, to slay a giant monster that threatens to corrupt and destroy their kingdom. You must traverse the massive labyrinth that is their kingdom, tracking the beast at every turn until you get close enough to use your powers to undo its influence.Bound's gameplay is rudimentary, consisting primarily of running, jumping across moving platforms, and climbing ladders. Most of what passes for challenge has to do with navigating the many alternate routes through the labyrinth, sussing out what's actually going to get you down to a lower level safely, what's an actual shortcut, and what may result in plunging to your doom.But like Journey before it, the devil is in the details. Each stage is a cubist marvel, where every single element feels like it's forged from living, shattered stained glass. The game works wonders with this aesthetic, going from alien, gravity-defying architecture stretching into the stratosphere to vast, beautiful seas that roll out in waves for miles.Repetitive as these actions can sometimes be, the game still deserves praise for creating a protagonist who neither looks nor moves like any other video game character: a lithe, masked hero whose smallest motion is an act of grace.Then there's the princess herself--our heroic dancer who must travel the labyrinth. There isn't much to her from a mechanical standpoint. She can run and jump, and in lieu of an attack, she can perform an elaborate dance that allows her to traipse through dangerous environments unscathed. It's a wonderful idea, albeit somewhat undercooked. You can put some variations on the dance with simple button combinations, but doing so doesn't serve a meaningful purpose. Repetitive as these actions can sometimes be, the game still deserves praise for creating a protagonist who neither looks nor moves like any other video game character: a lithe, masked hero whose smallest motion is an act of grace.Like all interpretive dance, this is all a metaphor for something much more cerebral, presented through the frame of scenes set in the real world--adding the right amount of context to make parsing your journey insightful and rewarding. The ultimate meaning of Bound's tale relies on your own perspective, but there's a subtle-yet-undeniable emotional weight from beginning to end. Bound is a game that displays immense amounts of contemplation and ambition in every aspect except gameplay."
1758,Loadout,7.0,2,"on the PC. But on the PlayStation 4, Loadout tries new things, completely revamping its method of distributing weapon parts that makes collecting them almost as exciting as constructing them into a vast array of deadly guns. Despite a lackluster campaign and a locked-out ranked mode, Loadout is a frantic and entertaining shooter on the PlayStation 4 and will keep you happy on your quest for loot, with a smile on your face and a numb trigger finger. Team Fortress 2 always knew you could be. Earning parts in Loadout on PlayStation 4 is a much different experience than in the PC version of the game. On a PC, you unlock parts from daily prizes or in a tech tree by earning experience and spending blutes, Loadout’s in-game currency awarded at the end of matches. On the PlayStation 4 edition, weapon parts, gear, and safes are often awarded at the end of finished multiplayer matches or campaign missions. Safes, which contain items of varying rarity, are opened with dynamite, which is bought with spacebux, Loadout’s other currency that must be purchased with actual cash and not blutes, somewhat like the currency in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive’s weapon cases and keys. Parts are assigned levels, as well as a degree of rarity that moves from common to rare items. Rarer parts can grant optional attribute boosts, such as decreased reload times or additional health. Comparing the two systems of delivering items, from the tech tree of the PC version to earning parts post-match on the PlayStation 4, I prefer the latter. Parts and gear come at a steady flow in Loadout on PlayStation 4, and I can’t deny the giddy feeling of anticipation that grows just before opening each loot chest or safe filled with new toys to play with. You gain a lot of weapon parts as you progress, but not everything is worth keeping. The included fusion mechanic allows you to take a lower-tier item and merge it with other disposable parts to increase its potency. It’s a great way to burn off extra junk you don’t need, while making your weapons even stronger, all the while not spending any actual cash on upgrades yourself. And the upgrade is often quickly apparent, too; promoting that level three pyro rocket to level five or higher can mean the difference between leaving your foes medium rare or well done. Crafting and naming your own custom weapon is a joy I’ve rarely experienced in other online shooters. A machine gun with the offensive output of mosquito bites later roars as it rips flesh from bone. A feeble rocket launcher that evokes more laughs than screams evolves over time to become a frightening, two-hit kill monster that causes enemies to burst into flame--it’s enough to bring a tear to your eye. The weak campaign mode, however, is a wet blanket that stifles some of that fire. There is no “story” to speak of, only five chapters with missions that consist of you fighting waves of AI-controlled alien baddies on the available multiplayer maps and gametypes. For at least a few missions, the campaign is passable, if not somewhat disappointing. But after playing through chapter after chapter of similar battles, the venture becomes tedious and dull. The only real incentive to play each campaign is tied into Loadout’s new method of distributing loot. Campaign mode offers loot packs and safes that drop randomly as you play through a match, and that unfortunately means having to wade through the muck for some of those precious parts and equipment--some of which, like deployable health packs and jump boots, is awarded at the end of certain missions. At least collecting the extra loot in campaign is still enjoyable; it’s just the parts in between that are the issue. The highly craftable guns are the stars of the show, and the customizable loadouts set the stage. One additional positive about the campaign, however, is that it allows you to earn some additional spacebux without having to fork over any of your hard-earned cash. Currently, Loadout on PlayStation 4 is the only version to have the campaign included with the package. The PC version is set to have the currently separate campaign (now in beta) merged with the base game next year. Thankfully, the core multiplayer experience is just as exhilarating and violent as ever, and it is here you spend most of your time. The controls adapt well to DualShock 4, though aiming does feel a little squirrelly when zoomed in--a problem that can be alleviated by lowering aim sensitivity. Other than that, Loadout plays exceptionally well on the controller; skirmishes haven’t lost an ounce of their raw intensity in the transfer from the keyboard and mouse. Across six varied maps that include deep crevasses, hidden pathways, and high ledges, you sprint, dive, and leap high into the air while raining fire on enemies above and below. Loadout’s action is ferocious, and each clash erupts in a chaotic frenzy of flying rockets, popping grenades, and neon lasers; the vibrant cartoon visuals are a colorful foil to the absurd violence onscreen. During battles, flesh is seared from bone, heads are blown apart to leave bouncing eyeballs and a brain, and somewhere in the fracas is a person thrusting their gun between their hips as a pair of disembodied legs run across the war-tattered field before collapsing. Loadout is often as hilarious as it is grotesque, leaving you vacillating between laughing at the slapstick insanity and cringing at the immense gore. And you know what? It’s quite a lot of fun--though much of it is like a riding a rollercoaster through a whirlwind of bullets and body parts.   Multiplayer consists of four-on-four matches among five game types: blitz, death snatch, extraction, domination, and jackhammer. Blitz and domination are won by taking control points on a map, the latter of which has you fighting to control three points at once. Death snatch is Loadout’s take on classic death match, and plays similar to Call of Duty’s Kill Confirmed mode. In death snatch, dead opponents drop a vial of glowing blutes that must be snagged in order for the death to count as a kill. Extraction tasks each team with protecting a teammate who collects blutonium deposits and places them into marked grinders to score points. Finally, jackhammer is a mode similar to capture the flag, except the flag is a massive hammer that smashes enemies into itty bitty meaty chunks. You can kill up to five opponents, which adds extra points to your score when the hammer is claimed at your base. There are two downsides to multiplayer; the most notable is the lack of the ranked mode, Annihilation, which is currently locked out with “Coming Soon!” written over it. Instead, you are left with the unranked arena, which performs rather poorly in terms of matching you with players of similar skill. You have an overall level that increases as you gain experience points earned after completing matches. However, that rank is effectively slashed in the arena, and you often find yourself paired with unskilled allies or against a team of seasoned players. I realize this is the caveat of any unranked multiplayer, but it’s incredibly frustrating to play a session consisting of about ten losses in a row due to unbalanced matchmaking. The other issue with multiplayer is that with only six maps, things soon slide into repetition. Having five game types does help deter some boredom, but after a dozen hours I was more than ready for a change in scenery. And just when will there be more than three customizable characters to choose from?   Loadout on PlayStation 4 is not without its issues, but overall it remains an energetic, madcap shooter with a violent sense of humor that delights as often as it disgusts. There are still tweaks to be made--the underwhelming campaign is the first that comes to mind--and, once released, the ranked mode will also greatly increase its value, which is a lot, considering that the game is already free of charge. Regardless, there is a lot of entertainment to be found in Loadout. The welcome new changes to earning gun parts will keep you killing, collecting, and customizing for many blood-soaked hours to come as the game continues to evolve, just like the many weapons that call it home."
3824,PAIN (2007),5.0,1,"  The first Pain was pricey ($9.99 USD) for a game that included only one level, but its simple premise proved entertaining for a brief time. Its expansion, Pain: Amusement Park, is cheaper ($5.99 USD), but it too contains a limited amount of material. Unless you were madly in love with the original game, you'll want to take a pass on this add-on.        Shockingly, Pain: Amusement Park takes place in an amusement park. Your goal is to launch people out of a slingshot and inflict as much pain on them as possible by guiding them into rides, costumed employees, exploding barrels, or whatever else looks like it might hurt. You can strike a number of poses while in midair and even use your ""ooch"" ability to scoot along the ground by pressing the D pad in the desired direction. Every time you hurt yourself or smash into an object and damage or destroy it, you'll earn points, which aren't really good for anything other than personal satisfaction since the game only has online leaderboards for some of the modes.     Although it can be amusing to cause mayhem, break things, and discover the paths of destruction required to score maximum points, the fun doesn't last very long. You're able to launch from only one preset point (the game gives you no clue that you can unlock a slightly different spot if you pull three hidden switches), so it won't be long before you've seen everything there is to see. You'll also need to be forgiving if you're to look past the terrible camera that is zoomed in too close when you're on the ground. Toss in erratic ""ooch"" controls and it's a crapshoot as to where you're going to end up once you make first contact with a solid object.      There are two additional single-player modes: one in which you grab a clown in midair and fling him into exploding barrels, and another in which you play ""hot and cold"" by trying to find a particular teddy bear. They don't add any significant entertainment value. A few multiplayer modes let you compete locally with up to three other players. You can bet on whether or not your opponents will hit targets that you set or try to match each other's injuries. The expansion's only intriguing addition is the Painlab. It's an experimental area in which the developer can create new environments on a planned, weekly basis. The current area isn't much more than a few brick walls and exploding objects, but the potential for some interesting concepts exists.         Pain: Amusement Park's biggest problem is that it's not a very good value. You get one level, plus the Painlab, and that's about it. The amusement park's design isn't particularly good and doesn't have the depth of the downtown level from the original release. To top it all off, additional characters are still available only for a fee, which is almost criminal considering how much you're already paying for such limited content. If you already own Pain and are craving more, this expansion may be worth a look, but its appeal is extremely limited.    "
2181,WWE 2K14,6.0,1,"th century? Michael Jackson? Harry Houdini? Or maybe you're partial to Ted Danson. These are all fine choices, if you like going the obvious route. How about someone who transformed the flashy fisticuffs of professional wrestling into an art form? Enter Randy Savage. No one else could have made sequined robes seem like the perfect attire for a burly man. And it's not like my high opinion of Savage is because of my hazy memory. His gruff, stilted speech and deliberate mannerisms enthrall me just as much today as they did so many years ago. The Macho Man was a theatrical genius, and the embodiment of everything that makes professional wrestling so compelling. When the wrestlers of my youth faded into the sunset, so too did my interest in the WWE. But the nostalgic flame of yesteryear still burns inside me. All of those old feelings were rekindled in WWE 2K14. There's a mode called 30 Years of WrestleMania that focuses on the history of wrestling's Super Bowl. I got a warm glow in my chest when I replayed some of these classic matches. Remember when The Ultimate Warrior and Hulk Hogan exchanged clotheslines in the center of the ring? Oh, how thrilling it was to see these two titans go toe-to-toe to settle whatever feud they had. By the end of the fight, Warrior's face paint had chipped away, and we could finally see what the real man looked like. And then there was the time Andre the Giant callously tossed hundred-dollar bills after triumphing over Big John Studd. Such a blatant and hilarious disregard for money! WWE 2K14's celebration of its prestigious history is very well done. We expect entrance themes and costumes to be ripped from the archives, but the game goes even further than that. By completing historical objectives within each match, brief cutscenes are cued up that mirror what happened in real life so many years ago. Have Hulk initiate a grapple outside of the ring against Andre the Giant, and watch the galoot from Grenoble headbutt the ring post just as Hogan ducks away. These scenarios are so expertly crafted that they drew me in completely to the main event. And even when I had never seen the match in the first place, I was still roped in to the drama because of how well it's presented. By the end of the fight, Warrior's face paint had chipped away, and we could finally see what the real man looked like. Before I realized that wrestling was scripted, I would recoil when one of my heroes would take a chair to his back or have his head forcibly slammed into the ground. But even once I knew their tricks, I would still wince. My emotions would overwhelm my senses, and I would think how much it would hurt to be thrown to and fro. Have you ever slammed your elbow into a ring after missing a flying leap off the top rope? It must be at least a little painful. WWE 2K14 communicates the dramatic punishment of professional wrestling. Most hits have serious impact, so much so that you wonder how someone could possibly survive some of these moves. Thunderous sound effects and elaborate wind-up animations make you grimace despite yourself. If only strikes carried as much weight as other moves. When WWE 2K14's wrestlers mimic bar-room brawlers by throwing haymakers, the game's relationship to reality crumbles away. The wrestlers punch and kick so quickly that there's no weight behind them. And considering how often you perform these moves, there's an odd separation that makes matches feel imbalanced. Furthermore, the core action is so reliant on counterattacks that it's closer to a sequence of quick-time events than a body slam ballet. Instead of rewarding positioning or smart tactics, victory goes to the wrestler who taps a button first. This strips away much of the appeal of competitive matches because the same tactics can be used to win, no matter who you are or who you play against. After participating in one clunky, awkward match after another, I longed for the fluid choreography of the real thing. Absent WrestleMania's finest moments, the matches are dry affairs that do little to spark the imagination. Such issues cut even deeper when more than two men enter the ring. The utter chaos of multi-man bouts never comes close to being captured in WWE 2K14. What should be satisfyingly crazy turns into a series of clunky one-on-one battles with no one quite sure what's expected of him. Really, all of the non-traditional fights lack the excitement that should exist when rules are shaken up. Escaping a steel cage, for instance, requires you to tap a button at the optimal position to go faster. Cramming your main objective into a simple minigames is oddly disconnected from the core action. And if you should climb to the top of a Hell in a Cell cage, don't expect to be able to recreate the infamous match between Mick Folley and The Undertaker. You can neither toss your opponent off nor fall through the cage, and the awkward animations preventing such disasters look hopelessly cartoonish. Stick to traditional fights in WWE 2K14 unless you want to see just how limited the combat is. If you ever wanted to be Vince McMahon (minus the ridiculous walk), Universe mode lets you tinker with the behind-the-scenes drama. Create feuds between wrestlers who used to be best friends and shake up the calendar if you've ever wished that Raw would air on Tuesdays. Universe mode is certainly interesting if you've ever dreamed of crazy scenarios, but it doesn't make up for the lackluster wrestling once you step back in the ring. At least there's one element outside the ring that anyone could enjoy. Creation mode let's you design an unholy monster to be your champion, which is absolutely riveting if you have a maniacal disposition. Make someone with teeny, tiny legs and cross your fingers that his femur doesn't snap in the middle of a bout. Or maybe you want his bones to break. Whatever floats your boat. It's a shame the wrestling isn't up to par in WWE 2K14 because the elements surrounding it are so interesting. Though not nearly as captivating as Randy Savage, The Undertaker has a mode dedicated to his undefeated record in WrestleManias. You have the option to knock him from his lofty perch with a willing participant, or fend off everyone clamoring for your throne as The Undertaker. It's a neat mode that embraces one of the iconic personalities in the sport, but none of these activities have lasting appeal because fights are so dreary. When WWE 2K14 does work, its because of its recreation of history. For anyone who grew up loving professional wrestling, be prepared to be swept away in a tide of nostalgia. If only the core action could have been as compelling."
917,Destiny 2,6.0,1,"Destiny 2 has been struggling to keep its players invested for a while now. Going into its second expansion, Warmind, the biggest question was whether or not Destiny 2 can entice people to come back to it. This expansion is geared more toward the hardcore players, offering difficult endgame activities and a slower, more demanding level grind to get there. If you aren't interested in those things, though, there's not a lot here besides the same old Destiny 2 activities to draw you in.Warmind's campaign consists of a handful of missions, and it takes around an hour and a half to complete. If you haven't played Destiny 2 much since Curse of Osiris, it's easy to jump back in; I started at 310 power and did some minimal grinding to keep up with each mission's recommended level. It remains a very welcome change from Destiny's more punishing pace, where skipping a few weeks meant another few weeks of intense grinding just to catch up.Like most story-centric activities in Destiny 2, Warmind's campaign does just enough explaining to justify fighting enemies in the first place and leaves you to fill in the rest yourself. That can work really well, but in Warmind, a lot of seemingly important things are packed into a very short amount of time; a buried Golden Age research facility, new information about Rasputin, a crazy-powerful spear, and suddenly a giant worm that you have to kill. It's not that those things aren't connected but rather that there's no time to absorb anything before you're in the final fight, and it's anticlimactic as a result.Individually, Warmind's different components are actually kind of cool. The Valkyrie spear can take out swarms of enemies in one very satisfying throw, and fighting a huge, serpentine monster is fun just for the spectacle of it. The new ally character, Ana Bray, is almost interesting--she's related to Clovis Bray, a historical figure in Destiny lore, and can speak to Rasputin--but she doesn't have enough time to develop into anything substantial. Though Warmind is an expansion about a hyper-intelligent AI that's been around since the first game, it feels like these are just the building blocks for what could be a compelling story.For laidback Destiny 2 players, the more accessible activities are a great way to test out the new Exotic weapon changes that launched alongside the expansion. The 1.2.0 update is available even if you don't have Warmind, but it's at least nice to have a reason to try out the Exotic buffs. My personal favorites are the Graviton Lance, which now fires a two-round burst with a heftier and more satisfying explosion on impact, and Riskrunner, which deals more damage when its Arc Conductor buff is active. They actually feel like true Exotics now and as a result are loot worth chasing, so much so that the changes kind of steal Warmind's thunder.Two of Warmind's story missions are disappointingly repurposed as Strikes, just like in Curse of Osiris. The addition of Nightfall-like modifiers to Heroic Strikes makes them a lot more difficult, at least, but the loot chest reward for completing them doesn't match the challenge--weapons and gear drop at 340 power, which is right about where you'll be when you finish the story. The new cap is 385, leaving a large gap between the ""easy"" content and the endgame that could have been filled with mid-tier Heroic Strike rewards. As a whole, the mid-level section of the expansion is unfortunately pretty empty of anything to motivate you to keep going forward.The new destination, the polar ice caps of Mars, is around the size of Io. In addition to new Adventures and Lost Sectors, Mars has new secrets to hunt down in the form of Sleeper Nodes. They're primarily for other quests, but they can be fun to look for and a good excuse to explore. Mars also boasts a new activity, Escalation Protocol. It works kind of like a Public Event in that anyone in the area can join, but it's way harder, throwing waves of high-level Hive at you. As of week one, it's basically impossible to complete it, which makes it a nice accomplishment to chase if you've been wanting more to do in the late game. So far, Escalation Protocol is the most intriguing thing in Warmind--I actually want to level up enough so I can see what happens and what kind of loot I can get.It certainly feels like Warmind has a slower burn than vanilla Destiny 2 or Curse of Osiris. In order to get the Exotic fusion rifle Sleeper Simulant, for example, you have to complete a time-intensive multi-step quest that involves running both Heroic Strikes and Escalation Protocols. On the hardcore end of things, the challenging new Raid Lair is a big incentive to get your power level up. The grinding alone will likely keep the most dedicated players busy for a bit, and figuring out and implementing a viable strategy once you actually make it to the Raid Lair is, as always, a reward in itself."
2680,Inazuma Eleven 2,5.0,1,"Inazuma Eleven. The action in Firestorm/Blizzard picks up just seven days after the conclusion of the first game, beginning with an epilogue to that tale, resolving some of the former's outstanding plotlines. The celebrations don't last for long, however. Plucky goalkeeper Mark Evans doesn't even have time to return to training before football-mad aliens from Alius Academy decide to invade, on a crusade to destroy the world's schools through football.         If you played the first Inazuma Eleven, the sequel is immediately familiar. If you didn't, well, this game isn't aimed at you. Despite a number of tutorials, slowly drip-fed over the opening hours, Inazuma Eleven 2 is hugely reliant on your having gone through the first. The plot makes little sense if you aren't already familiar with Mark, Axel, and crew. Mechanically, Inazuma Eleven 2 is also pretty much the same game.     Inazuma Eleven 2 has two primary elements. The first has you and your team wandering around regions, chatting to non-player characters, buying up football kits and healing items, and generally advancing the plot. The kids now have access to a tour bus, so the whole of Japan is fair game. There's nothing really surprising to be found elsewhere--each areas has streets, parks, and schools with football pitches--but the concept of touring around the country allows the areas to look more varied at least. The overworld contains restore points that let you pay PP (points earned through playing football) to heal your characters, as well as training points that let you pay to increase a character's stats, such as power and speed.         The other element is actual football. On the pitch, you control characters with the stylus, drawing lines to direct them around and tapping to shoot or pass. It's exactly the same system as in the first game, and once again there's no immediacy to the controls, something usually required for an exciting game of football. Unlike in the first game, however, you no longer need to be able to see the goal onscreen to take a shot, since a shot button has been included in the top right-hand corner.      Each player has a bunch of special moves, either their starting moves, ones they learn throughout the course of the narrative, or moves you can teach them from books. These moves are key to winning, with the majority of shots going saved unless powered by a fire-breathing dragon, or turned into a spinning ball of ice. Defensive and offensive possession moves are also once again present, and the success of these depends on how your relevant stats compare to your opponent's.         As in the first game, matches take the form of four-a-side random battles or 11-a-side football matches against rival schools. In the former, you must either score first or retrieve the ball. Retrieving the ball takes seconds and is basically impossible to fail. The battles in which you have to score start off a little unbalanced, and you frequently find yourself unable to do so in the time limit. Once your characters start leveling up a bit, though, the battles become a breeze, and the difficulty curve is once again entirely misjudged.         Full matches are a little more involved and crop up a couple of times per chapter, with the option to play friendly games versus any team you've already faced. Here, you control a full team of 11 players and go all out to beat your rivals. At least, that's what happens later. At the beginning of the game, there are far too many matches entirely scripted; for narrative purposes, you can't win them. While the first game often required you to pull off a specific move at a specific time, the sequel simply prevents your shots, blocks, and tackles from having any effect. Once this stops happening and you can play properly, things are a little more fun, but it takes far too long to get to this point. Anyone not already familiar with how Inazuma Eleven works is going to be left confused and frustrated.         There are a few new additions to the way the game works, but nothing which has much impact. Most notable are the block moves and long shots. Block moves let you block shots going towards goal. For example, a striker may have a shoot move that also functions as a block move. In practice, this simply means you have slightly more special moves to use in defense. Long shots allow you to take a shot at goal from anywhere on the pitch by tapping an onscreen icon and then selecting a special move marked with an L. The long shots are few and far between and add surprisingly little to the overall match flow, given how the shots are nearly always saved.      The other main addition is the inclusion of alter egos, which let you switch between a player's personas, allowing each player to play two positions at different times. For instance, a character could be playing as a striker in the first half, and then you can switch to the alter ego and place the player in defense, with a different move set, in the second half. As you can imagine, given the vast number of players on offer, this is little more than an amusing curio, having no meaningful effect on the way the game plays out. It basically exists to explain away a certain character's backstory involving dead siblings and souls and never comes close to being anything like a game changer.         Inazuma Eleven 2 features female players, and you can recruit different (non-story) footballers depending on whether you own the Firestorm or Blizzard version. There's also a narrative subplot involving a budding romance between Mark and one of two girls depending on the version. Other than this, the version differences are minor. There are a huge number of incidental players to recruit (well over a thousand), but there's little collect-'em-all incentive when you can have only 100 players in your roster at once.     Other than these few minor changes, Inazuma Eleven 2 is pretty much the same game you played six months ago, only with a new story. It's the same gameplay, the same visuals, and the same frustrations. The plot is slightly more involved this time, and there's a lot more of it. For the first four or five hours in particular, the action is broken up by reams and reams of dialogue, cutscenes, scripted matches, and tutorials for a system the narrative assumes you already know.         Inazuma Eleven 2 is unlikely to win over critics of the previous game, and it's a fairly impenetrable starting point given its assumption that you know the previous game's story. For those who loved the original and are craving more of the same, it's a worthy follow-up because it keeps every system in place, largely untouched. For those who aren't already on Team Raimon, however, there's little here to celebrate.      "
101,World of Warcraft,9.0,2,"World of Warcraft: Dragonflight is about coming home, in more ways than one. It's a homecoming for the titular Dragonflights of Blizzard's long-running MMORPG, who return to their ancient ancestral home to pick up the pieces and rebuild after thousands of years away. It's also a homecoming for players, who after years of languishing in WoW's unpopular Shadowlands expansion, get to return to Azeroth and all the familiar sights and sounds it holds.Dragonflight, in that regard, is incredibly nostalgic, but not in the way you might expect. Though it without a doubt features the return of fan-favorite characters, monsters, and even gameplay systems, it never feels beholden or shackled by them. Instead, it takes those familiar elements and breathes new life into them. Whether it's the return of talent trees reminiscent of those from the game's earliest expansions, the game's updated user interface, its lack of mandatory activities, or the feeling of adventure the new dragonriding system invokes, Dragonflight miraculously feels both fresh and familiar at the same time. Even if there are some aspects of Dragonflight that could be improved, I can't help but be impressed at how a handful of new ideas, along with major facelifts to some old ones, breathe new life into Blizzard's flagship title.Dragons, as you might expect, are the star of this new expansion. Players ride new, highly customizable Dragon Isles Drakes. The majority of the main campaign's primary characters are dragons. There's even a new dragon race, the Dracthyr, that is only playable as the new dragon-themed spellcasting class, the Evoker. The Dragon Aspects Alexstrasza, Nozdormu, Wrathion, and Kalecgos all play key roles in the game's initial story campaign. To see them all front and center for the first real time since 2010's Cataclysm expansion is part of what makes Dragonflight feel so nostalgic, signaling a return to the high fantasy of Azeroth after nearly two years of the dark, dour, and death-themed settings and characters of Shadowlands.Even if its setting and characters feel familiar, there is no mistaking that Dragonflight brings a modern perspective to Blizzard's nearly 20-year-old MMO. WoW has long been defined by the rivalry between Azeroth's two political superpowers, the Horde and the Alliance. It was just four years ago that a massive war between the two factions nearly tore Azeroth apart in the game's Battle for Azeroth expansion. Dragonflight, however, feels almost entirely removed from the franchise's long history of inter-faction conflict.Part of that is thanks to the story Blizzard is trying to tell in Dragonflight. The expedition to the mystical Dragon Isles, which has only recently reemerged after 10,000 years, is not a race between the Horde and Alliance to see who can colonize it first (as was the case when the two factions discovered the continent of Pandaria back in 2012) but scientific in nature. From the outset, you're told the petty differences between the Horde and Alliance are to be put aside and that violence between the groups will not be tolerated. Adventurers (aka players) are welcome to join the Dragonscale Expedition, which consists of members of both factions, not because their martial prowess is needed to wage war against their longtime rivals, but because all the artisans, scientists, and explorers coming along are bound to need a hand, and some occasional protection, while documenting the many mysteries of the Dragon Isles.Dragonflight's themes of cooperation and exploration also stem from gameplay realities. It was earlier this year that Blizzard tore down the wall between the two factions, at long last allowing friends on different sides of Azeroth's Iron Curtain to group together for dungeons, raids, and more. To play up the idea of a faction war and insist that each and every Horde and Alliance player are mortal enemies, even while players on opposite factions are quite literally fighting side-by-side and talking to one another, would have been absurd. Blizzard, thankfully, didn't go that route, and smartly focused on aspects of WoW that have felt largely absent in recent years, namely its sense of adventure.Dragonriding works miracles in that department. On paper, it doesn't sound like much. The ability to fly in WoW has been around since 2007, after all. But if there was ever a feature introduced specifically for a single expansion that deserves to become a new standard in all expansions moving forward, dragonriding is it. Dragonriding is fast. Very fast. As in, almost three times as fast as the game's fastest non-dragonriding mounts. But even putting aside the obvious speed advantages, it's also remarkably fun. That's because rather than effectively functioning as a passive speed buff, as the game's normal mounts do, dragonriding mounts bring actual gameplay to the table and allow you to interact with the environment in meaningful ways. Diving will help increase your speed. Flying uphill, conversely, can be a struggle. Trying to get to a high-up mountain top? Find a nearby building or uprooted tree to take off from and give yourself a little extra height as you begin your ascent. Flying is no longer just a way to get from point A to point B, but engaging gameplay all its own.You even have abilities while dragonriding, namely a speed boost and an upward surge that helps get you off the ground. You can unlock more later, along with the power to use your abilities more often, from collecting dragonriding glyphs that are scattered throughout each of the four Dragon Isles zones. In a brilliant design choice for a game that has long held players' hands when it comes to questing and exploring its world, these glyphs are not marked on your map. Instead, when one is nearby, the game will alert you, giving you a general idea of where the glyph might be and how far away it is. From there it's up to you to ascend skyward and keep your eyes peeled. These are hardly hidden and can usually be found in high places, but it makes the act of flying through a zone all the more exciting, knowing there are meaningful rewards to be found. Better yet is that all of the glyphs are available for you to find from the moment you acquire your first Dragon Isles Drake within the first hour of the expansion. There is no max level requirement or any kind of barrier keeping you from simply spending the next hour meticulously collecting each glyph and unlocking dragonriding's full potential as soon as possible, if your heart so desires. After numerous expansions of having flying be off limits at the start and needing to be unlocked months later through an assortment of achievements and in-game accomplishments, simply having access to this new form of flying from the get-go does wonders when it comes to exploring the new world Blizzard has created.The one downside to dragonriding is you can occasionally find yourself needing to go uphill, but without the required energy to get high enough into the air to make any meaningful progress. That results in you hoofing it on foot or simply waiting around for your dragonriding stamina meter to recharge. It's not a great feeling, but it's one that thankfully starts to happen less and less often as you discover more glyphs and unlock more dragonriding traits that help to improve the experience. Flying at high speeds passively recharges your stamina, and the ability to do so consistently and more effectively becomes easier as you find more glyphs as well, allowing you to stay skybound for longer and eliminating the need to wait around for your stamina to recharge if you play your cards right.It was to help defeat Raszageth the first time around that the game's new Dracthyr race were originally created, before being put into a magic-induced coma by none other than Neltharion, the dragon Aspect that would go on to become Deathwing. Now, thousands of years later, the Dracthyr have awoken to a strange new world and must fight to find their place in it. Dracthyr are highly customizable, with both an elf-like ""Visage"" form and a dragon-form to spend hours perfecting in the game's character creator. The Dracthyr even come with a fun racial ability that automatically transforms you in and out of your Visage form depending on whether or not you are in combat. The primary downside to playing a Dracthyr from a visual standpoint is that your equipped gear while in dragon form is largely invisible, with only your shoulders and belt viewable on your character. There is a wide selection of cosmetic armor that can be equipped on your Dracthyr from the character creation screen to counteract this somewhat, but it's a remarkably odd choice (or in all likelihood a technical limitation) to have it so the majority of your gear can't be seen.Though the new Evoker class that is exclusive to the Dracthyr isn't as instantly iconic as the other two hero classes that have been added to WoW over the years, there's no denying the Dracthyr are Warcraft through and through. Some of their abilities, like Strafe and Deep Breath, are directly inspired by WoW's most iconic dragon raid bosses, while the majority of their toolset pulls directly from the various magics associated with each Dragonflight. The DPS-focused Devastation specialization utilizes the potent offensive capabilities of the Red and Blue Dragonflights, while the healing-oriented Preservation specialization takes full advantage of the nature-focused Green Dragonflight and the time-warping magic of the Bronze Dragonflight to keep allies healthy and out of harm's way. As for how they play, they are among the most mobile classes in the game, coming equipped with a built-in slow-fall, multiple movement-speed-enhancing abilities, and even a mini version of dragonriding that they can use at any time, no mount required. In addition to sporting numerous instant-cast spells, they are also the first class to feature what Blizzard has dubbed ""Empowered"" abilities, which is a fancy way of saying you hold down an ability key to charge up an ability, and then let off the key to fire off the ability to devastating effect. These all together make for a class that feels more active than even the Demon Hunter, as you are constantly charging up abilities, casting on the move, darting between friends and foes, and even rewinding time. It's fun and frenetic, and choosing for how long to charge up an Empowered ability and when to release it adds another level of planning and reactivity to each enemy encounter.If you've played any modern-day WoW expansions, you largely know what to expect when it comes to how Dragonflight's campaign is structured. You're ferried from main story quest to main story quest, working your way through each of the game's four new zones before hitting max level, after which you're granted access to things like Heroic dungeons, World Quests, and more. It's a little disappointing that for an expansion so steeped in themes of discovery, the main campaign on your first character is remarkably linear. You must complete the story campaign in The Waking Shores, for example, before unlocking the story campaign for the next zone, the Ohn'ahran Plains, etc.There is no skipping ahead or bouncing between multiple storylines, even though each zone's main story is largely standalone and isn't influenced by the events of the story in any other. You can break off and do side quests in any zone to your heart's content (and you'll likely want to, as Dragonflight's side quests are where many of its best stories and moments can be found), but you'll eventually have to return to the linear, critical path and finish the main story if you want to start progressing your character into the endgame. It's only then that you have the option for subsequent characters of selecting the order in which you'd like to play the main story thanks to the addition of a new Adventure mode, along with the added benefit of being able to tackle various World Quests from the start. It's a welcome feature, but it wasn't that long ago that WoW expansions let players go where they wanted from the get-go. Combined with the independence dragonriding grants you, and it feels like Blizzard missed a major opportunity to inject some much-needed freedom into the game's increasingly on-rails first-playthrough campaign experience.The four zones of the Dragon Isles themselves are a joy to journey through. Each zone is massive and built with verticality in mind in order to accommodate dragonriding, but they critically don't feel empty. Whereas many modern WoW expansions have felt the need to cram as many locations and enemies into its zones as possible, oftentimes to their own detriment, the new Dragon Isles zones feel remarkably open, alive, and lived in. The Azure Span and the Ohn'ahran Plains in particular feel like greatest-hits versions of zones from expansion's past. The Ohn'ahran Plains captures the essence of zones like Nagrand (both versions) and even the Barrens, while the Azure Span is almost like a long-lost Northrend zone, complete with the ever-lovable Tuskarr and music that invokes one of WoW's most beloved zones, Grizzly Hills. The capital city of the Dragon Isles, Valdrakken, is conveniently located high above the rest of the zones. It never gets old leaping off the city's walls on your dragonriding mount, going into a dive, and flying at high-speeds to wherever in the Dragon Isles you want to go. At max level, many of the zones have unique world events that add some great personality to them, like a giant community soup-making event at the Tuskarr village in the Azure Span or a siege to retake an ancient keep belonging to the Black Dragonflight in The Waking Shores. These kinds of events, in addition to being a great way to snag some rewards, help to make the Dragon Isles feel like real places rather than mere quest hubs.Dragonflight feels nostalgic without falling into the common trap of focusing too heavily on what came before. The Azure Span, for example, isn't a carbon copy of any one zone from Northrend. Instead, it's inspired by the past in all the right ways while still standing on its own. The same can be said for WoW's reworked talent tree system, which takes some key inspiration from the iconic talent trees of the game's early expansions but reimagines them in a thoughtfully modern way. At first glance, they can be a little intimidating. Instead of one talent tree for your chosen class and specialization, each specialization now has two trees to contend with. One is shared across the entire class, and focuses more on useful utility like interrupts, movement-enhancing abilities, and survivability. The specialization-specific tree is where you'll get into the real meat of the new system, as you look to create a build for your specialization.The level of freedom the new talent trees offer, especially when compared to the Mists of Pandaria-era talents that simply offered a list of multiple-choice questions, can be overwhelming initially, but each specialization tree is usually structured in a way that sticking primarily to the left, middle, or right of any tree will result in a build that synergizes relatively well. There is, of course, tons of room for more customization and fine-tuning, and I can safely say it's been a long time since I've spent hours simply staring at talents, reading about abilities, and theorycrafting builds like I've done in Dragonflight. Talents can also now be changed and tweaked at nearly any time outside of combat, and dedicated players will want to have multiple builds saved for specific situations, whether it's a particular encounter in a dungeon or a build that focuses more heavily on area-of-effect abilities. Though that kind of depth is likely to turn some players off, the ability to simply look up a guide online and import a talent build directly into the game is a nice convenience for those who don't feel like diving into the nitty-gritty details themselves.The new talent tree system is overall a huge success, with every new level gained and every talent point spent feeling impactful in a way the previous talent system never did. Classes play largely like they have in more recent expansions, with many of the abilities on offer in each talent tree having been pulled directly from sources like Artifacts in Legion and Covenant abilities in Shadowlands. If I do have one complaint about the new talent trees, it's that many abilities that were once baseline across a class, in particular utility-focused abilities, have now become optional in each class's class talent tree. That means when you group with a Paladin, for example, you can no longer be sure that particular Paladin has access to previously class-defining abilities like Blessing of Protection, Devotion Aura, Blessing of Freedom, etc. Even if it's nice to have the option to forgo picking up every possible utility ability offered in the talent trees, in the future I would like to see more of those kinds of spells become part of each class' built-in toolkit, and instead see more new and interesting choices offered in the talent trees.Reputation grinds have long been a part of WoW, and Dragonflight smartly overhauls those too, in a way that somehow both keeps the spirit of the old system intact while also offering something new. Instead of the standard ""Neutral, Friendly, Honored, Revered, Exalted"" reputation format used since the game's creation, Dragonflight uses a Renown system similar to what was seen in Shadowlands. Key faction reputations are now spread out across 25-30 different levels instead of five and require far less reputation to unlock per level, meaning you are more regularly unlocking new rewards. Critically, increasing your Renown level with these factions isn't tied to player power like they were in Shadowlands, and are largely cosmetic in nature, unlocking new transmogrification pieces for your character and customization options for your Dragon Isles Drakes. Leveling them up at your own pace is part of Dragonflight's endgame, with most side quests and world quests rewarding various amounts of reputation. There is unfortunately some key story content locked behind certain Renown ranks that run the risk of making the reputation grind feel more mandatory than it should be. Additionally, those keen on professions will want to push harder than the average player in order to unlock certain crafting recipes through the Renown system. Even with that in mind, the new system is undoubtedly a vast improvement over what has come before.The fact that there is no player power tied to increasing faction Renown gets to another key aspect of what makes Dragonflight feel so refreshing. For over half a decade, WoW players have been living in what has now been coined the ""borrowed power"" or ""Artifact power"" era of Blizzard's MMO. This is an era where progression was not simply tied to finding better gear, but to numerous additional systems that required players to collect specific resources in order to invest and make their character more powerful. These ""AP grinds"" made huge swathes of content, whether it was collecting Soul Ash from Torghast in Shadowlands or completing Island Expeditions for Azerite Power in Battle for Azeroth, feel mandatory, regardless of how fun or interesting those particular activities were. All of that is gone in Dragonflight. It's almost disorienting to hit max level and not be hit over the head with weekly chores and tasks that need to be completed in order to not fall behind. But that disoriented feeling soon gives way to elation over the realization that in Dragonflight's endgame, you can simply do what you want to progress your character, instead of feeling forced to do things you don't. You can do dungeons. You can PvP. You can farm reputation and unlock various cosmetic rewards with the key factions. You can focus on professions. Nothing feels mandatory in Dragonflight when it comes to progressing your character, and that fact feels every bit as liberating as the game's dragonriding.Speaking of professions, Dragonflight has given those a major overhaul as well, adding some much-needed complexity to a system that until now has largely gone untouched from the game's earliest days. There are now crafting-specific stats (which can be further boosted by equipping profession-specific gear and accessories), specializations, item crafting difficulty, multiple ways to improve or fine-tune your crafted gear, and more. It's definitely a little confusing diving into it all for the first time, but even if the exact reasons why a particular piece of crafted gear came out the way it did isn't 100% clear, the basics of the system--i.e. gather specific types of materials and then craft it--are the same as they've always been. There are numerous crafting-focused NPCs that can be talked to who attempt to explain how the new systems work, but I found the information they provided to not be entirely useful or not specific enough to truly help.For those who want to solely focus on professions, doing so seems much more rewarding and viable now. That's partly due to the new work order system, where players can post items they would like to have made and provide certain materials, and which crafters can then fulfill. It's a handy system for when you want a specific item made, and it's even handier for crafters, who no longer need to spam trade chat with their wares or randomly fill the auction house with items that may or may not be wanted in an effort to make some gold. Even if professions aren't your primary focus, it still feels cool to deck out your character in profession gear and specialize in particular aspects of your chosen craft. A miner, for example, may excel at mining a particular kind of ore, or a blacksmith may be able to craft gear for one particular armor slot at a higher item level. Starting out, you won't be able to specialize in more than a few aspects of your profession at once. However, with enough time and dedication, it will eventually be possible to effectively learn all of a profession's specializations. It's still a little too early to tell how professions will shake out over the course of the expansion, but for now it feels like they are more relevant and more engaging than they've ever been for a long time, even if there is a higher learning curve associated with them than before.Blizzard wisely decided to not fill Dragonflight with too many one-off systems and instead focus on core aspects of the game that were overdue for a shake-up. Alongside the game's talent tree revamp and an overhaul for professions, the game's user interface has also undergone a dramatic modernization in Dragonflight. The new UI is still definitively WoW (complete with gryphons, or the for the first time, wyverns, on each side of the primary action bar), but far more subdued and modern-looking. More importantly, the UI is now highly-customizable with the addition of an ""Edit Mode."" In this mode, nearly every aspect of the UI is able to be resized, moved, or tweaked in some form. It's great to, for the most part, no longer need a long list of fan-made add-ons (goodbye Bagnon and Bartender) and instead be able to customize your UI to your liking with just a few in-game clicks, no addon managers or fansites required. No doubt many players will still want to use some UI-enhancing addons, but it no longer feels mandatory, which is a boon for more casual or first-time players. There are still some aspects of the UI and Edit Mode that could use improvement (why in the world can't I resize the minimap or move the XP bar?), but all-in-all, they are a huge, if overdue, step forward.The bones of Dragonflight at launch are an incredible foundation for Blizzard to build upon. Whether it's the new flow of an endgame freed from mandatory grinds or how it feels to break the speed of sound on dragonback, Blizzard's MMO is currently in the best state it's been in over half a decade. It's worth mentioning how many systems and unlocks are now account-wide in Dragonflight, which should make leveling up alt characters a far more enjoyable, and less time-consuming, experience. Dragonriding will be accessible from the start on all your additional characters once it's unlocked on your first, and dragonriding glyphs found in the world are also shared account-wide. Though you'll still need to grind out Renown on each new character, there are some systems in place to greatly speed up the process if you hit certain milestones on your main, reducing yet another pain point players have had in recent years.But as anyone who has played WoW knows, a great expansion launch is not the be all, end all. Thankfully, Season 1, which was released a few weeks after Dragonflight's launch, delivers. Without the need to farm for additional resources like Soul Ash or Azerite, gearing is incredibly straightforward, allowing players to spend more time doing what they want to do rather than activities they feel forced to do. Dragonflight's new arena mode, Solo Shuffle, has been a blast and a great way for PvP-focused players to gear up (even if the queue times can be rough at times). The new raid boasts some fun and frenetic encounters while setting up the rest of the expansion's story nicely, and the experiment of having the first season's Mythic dungeon roster dip into older expansions (as was the case in Shadowlands Season 4) is a nice change of pace after running every Dragonflight dungeon on Heroic multiple times in the leadup to Season 1's launch. Though there are likely some players who will feel like they've run out of content, I'm of the opinion that having less ""mandatory"" things to do isn't a bad thing. There are always more classes to level up, old content to farm for transmog, or, dare I say it, other games to play. You shouldn't feel like you have to play 12-hours a day, seven-days a week to keep up, and so far Dragonflight has been refreshing in that regard.In general, Blizzard seems to be hitting all the right notes in the weeks following the expansion's release. Balance updates have been more frequent than in the Shadowlands-era, whereas in years past it felt like players would have to wait months for a major patch to deliver balance changes. Updates have come more frequently to various in-game systems too, like improvements to Solo Shuffle to more effectively punish quitters. Blizzard overall seems quicker to respond to feedback, and that can only lead to good things. The future's looking bright too. Blizzard made the unexpected move of releasing an extensive 2023 content roadmap outlining all the updates players can expect over the course of the year, the first of which is arriving on January 24. Major updates in Shadowlands were few and far between, so to see a years-worth of updates laid out so far in advance, with new content slated to arrive every couple months, is breathtaking. If Blizzard can stick to its roadmap and continue to be as responsive to feedback as it has been so far, the next 12 months of WoW will be something special.Only time will tell where Dragonflight will rank in comparison to WoW's eight other expansions, but it makes a powerful first impression, thanks both to its refreshing systems and the quality of its content. Early on in the expansion, you'll likely find a dwarf sitting by his lonesome near the Ruby Life Pools in The Waking Shore, looking out at the landscape beyond. He has a quest to give, but it's not your typical ""go here, collect or kill that"" style of quest. Instead, it's a quest to simply sit, talk, and listen. There is a long delay between each batch of dialogue at first, almost as if the dwarf is thinking carefully about what to say. The dwarf, it turns out, is actually an ancient member of the Red Dragonflight. He's been away from his home for thousands of years and never thought he would have the chance to see it again. As you sit and stare out into the horizon, he opens up to you, sharing painful memories of times long past. He begins to spill his heart and soul, not for your benefit, but for his.Dragonflight is sprinkled with little moments like these that encourage you to take your time and smell the roses, so to speak. Though there are still plenty of collectathons and kill quests to complete, Dragonflight shines when it reminds you of the unique world you're in and invites you to slow down and immerse yourself in it. It's an expansion about remembering where you've come from, yet embracing what comes next. It's about coming home. Considering the quality on display in Dragonflight and all the changes that have been made to improve the core systems of Blizzard's iconic RPG, I have no doubt more than a few lapsed players that had grown tired of what Azeroth had to offer in recent years will be doing just that."
2382,Pacific Rim,4.0,0,"     Pacific Rim wisely avoids any attempt to follow the film's storyline to the letter, but the repetition of  playing as the same three Jaegers (or robots) and two Kaiju (or monsters) throughout its mere 12 stages sours the experience. Without explanation, it soon pits you against other Jaegers instead of the monsters threatening human existence as we know it, and to make matters worse, each of the five combatants in the core release cling to patterns so predictable that it's not too much of a challenge to score a gold ranking after but one failed attempt. That's less true of the harder Survival mode, but even mastering its additional challenges amounts to little more than making smarter blocks and throwing well-timed punches.         On the bright side, Pacific Rim lets you customize your preferred Jaeger or Kaiju using the parts you've earned from playing; on the downside, it keeps many of the cosmetic options (such as the ability to change colors) locked behind a roughly $2.00 downloadable add-on. And so it goes with the three extra Kaiju available for purchase, including the flying monster Otachi that you encounter early on in the lightweight campaign. Not that downloadable content is necessarily bad; it's just that Pacific Rim makes the unwise decision to lean so heavily on it that the core game ends up feeling like an extended demo.    "
2204,Pokemon X / Y,8.0,2,"    But the highlights of the game are the pokemon themselves. One of the hallmark features of the Pokemon series has always been the charming designs of its creatures, and they're shown off to great effect here. There are, unfortunately, quite a lot of shared animations in battle (such as the butt-facing shake of Tail Whip or the forward hop of a Charge), but the hundreds of pokemon feature enough unique moves and twitches that their personalities shine through regardless. You know an Azurill is a happy chappy by the way he bounces on his blue balloon, for example, while a little wag of Fennekin's bushy tail signals she's impatient for you to make a move. Pokemon attacks have some serious visual impact, too. Water pokemon lift high into the air on a column of blue water when initiating the surf attack, while the devastating laser-like beam of an Oblivion Wing looks like it could hurt. Pikachu and his pals have never looked so good.  Its looks may be a major step forward, but Pokemon X/Y is still rooted in the series' classic tropes. Little about the core gameplay or the adventure you undertake is wholly new. You're a young trainer travelling the region and collecting data on pokemon, and along the way you run across a nefarious scheme being concocted by a group of villains (in this case, Team Flare). Team Flare has an interesting evil plot, and you'll come across a few lovely moments involving a major character and his beloved pokemon, but for the most part, the narrative, as always, plays second fiddle to the gameplay itself.         "
2126,Super Motherload,7.0,2,"Beneath the surface of Mars lies tranquility. The exotic planet houses valuable minerals amid the impenetrable rocks, and as you survey the vast subterranean world, a serenity washes over you. It's not the treasures that drive you many leagues below the surface, nor is it the promise of unraveling a mysterious conspiracy. No, it's the desire for solitude that serves as your motivation. A calm that can only exist when the tight spaces surrounding you provide comfort, rather than claustrophobia, and every clump of dirt you push aside puts you one meter further from civilization. There's pleasure in Super Motherload's excavation duties, and it's that escape that pulls you ever deeper into this alien world. Of course, you weren't set to Mars to unwind from the everyday toils of life on Earth. The unquenchable greed of a starving corporation shuttled you to this distant oasis. The Solarus Corporation craves money, its very existence dependent upon expanding its already bursting coffers. And so you dig for gold and silver, trigger explosions, and circumvent magma, all to keep the powers that be happy. It's a thankless job, so you find respite where you can, but their presence is a constant reminder. The dreamy contentment of rhythmic mining is shattered when voices scream in your ear, extolling you to dive ever deeper. As if there was any other direction to travel. Hints of psychotic episodes infecting those already stationed below ground, of alien civilizations threatened by your largesse, offer more distraction than intrigue, and never blossom into fulfilling tales. So you tune out the noise. Your capable driller eliminates debris as quickly as it can soar up vertical passageways. Carve tunnels beneath the two-dimensional landscape, shifting away dirt in strategic paths to ensure that whatever mineral you desire becomes yours. Smart planning leads to copious rewards. As mobile as your driller is, it's unable to burrow while hovering, so if you're not careful, troves of platinum and emeralds might rest within sight but out of reach, repeatedly lecturing you for being so sloppy. A feeling of accomplishment washes over you as you scoop up the many minerals that populate this world. There's little guidance in how best to proceed, so when you figure out how to make the many gems and minerals yours, you feel as if you earned whatever spills into your purse. There's pleasure in Super Motherload's excavation duties, and it's that escape that pulls you ever deeper into this alien world. Your driller is agile, yes, but also fragile. Without enemies to fear, it's your own carelessness that provides the biggest danger. Even with this knowledge, it's easy to forget about your own vulnerability. The lone propeller atop your craft provides surprising lift, and as you careen joyfully toward the surface, smashing into an ill-placed rock can lead to a quick grave. However, punishment won't leave much of a mark. Your cargo is unceremoniously taken away, but you're allowed to carry on undeterred. It's your driller's other failings that provide the most distress. Fuel is as valuable as anything on Mars, and your cargo hold is quite small. As you quickly eat away at your gasoline and extra space, your driller soon becomes useless. So you must resurface to the nearest station, where you unload your goods and refill. This is a frequent and unsatisfying necessity of life underground. And though you can purchase expensive teleporters, you spend too much time drifting between your base and the excavation site. At least you can make use of all of the money you're accumulating. Upgrade your driller when you return back to base to extend its life ever so slightly. Expand the cargo hold and fuel tank, strengthen your hull, and improve the speed of your craft. Sink money into a radar to be able to identify which debris is desirable, and what's just dirt. Unfortunately, the radar isn't much help. The more money you spend on it, the more focused it becomes, but it's rarely detailed enough to provide information that you couldn't gleam from just using your eyes. At least the other upgrades offer more tangible rewards. The option to smelt materials provides the most interesting upgrade. Your smelter unlocks combinations that can earn you money much quicker. By nabbing materials in a specific pattern, you automatically forge alloys, which adds a dose of strategy to your shoveling duties. As you dive deeper below the surface, the terrain becomes more difficult to navigate. Rocks and magma halt your progress, so you must find clever ways to avoid them. That's where bombs come in. By either picking up bombs while digging or purchasing them at shops, you gain an invaluable way to borrow deeper. Be careful, though, because a sizable C4 blast could eliminate nearby pockets of gold even though you were trying to disintegrate some rocks. So, just like in real life, you should do a bit of planning before you detonate your explosives. T-shaped blasts are perfect for carving out a niche to dig while vertical strikes can clear an entire column in a snap. Charge certain blocks with an electromagnetic jolt to turn them into magma, and then either use a bomb to clear that lava out of the way, or drill through it yourself while taking some damage. Super Motherload hides its puzzle elements in the early going, but if you want to become the richest person on Mars, you have to become a thoughtful and willing arsonist. There's beauty in loneliness. Super Motherload is at its best when you're miles below Mars' surface, lost in the peaceful rhythm of excavation. But if that solitude frightens you, three of your friends can join you in your quest for minerals. Just don't get your hopes up for online friendships to blossom; Super Motherload is offline only. No matter if you're alone or with friends, there's an uncommon appeal to your extraterrestrial exploits. There's no excitement here, nothing that will make you whoop or yell. The draw comes from the slow satisfaction of carving intricate paths, of razing rocks and planting bombs. It's thoughtful desolation. Super Motherload somehow makes alienation feel like a warm embrace."
1525,LEGO Jurassic World,6.0,1,"Call of Duty or Uncharted. Or we may think of the glut of open world games we've seen flood the market, all complete with minimaps covered in dots of things to do or collect, compelling you to comb the landscape and visit every single one. The Lego series of games by Traveller's Tales has perfectly embodied these conflicting design philosophies across the many franchises it's taken on and put them in a kid-friendly package. That's why setting a Lego game in the Jurassic Park world is such an enticing prospect: it's a series that naturally combines the cinematic with the sprawling. Lego Jurassic World encompasses just that with style and undeniable charm that will melt your cynical heart, but the boring things the game makes you do hamper the joy. If you've played any of the recent Lego games, you know exactly what you're getting into: solidly designed platforming amidst a world made of bricks. Combat takes a back seat to simple problem solving as you find ways to clear environmental obstacles, which often takes the form of building new things out of loose bricks that are lying around. Cooperation is also encouraged thanks to hop-in multiplayer and a cavalcade of characters to take control of, each of which has special abilities you need to use to progress through the game. Tying everything together are hub worlds that you can wander around in and collect red bricks (which unlock the ability to buy certain perks) and gold ones (which unlock certain optional sections once you have enough of them), so you get a little bit of structural variety as you progress, which is a nice counterpoint to the very linear levels proper. A big part of the appeal of the Lego games is the fact that you can switch between characters at will and play around with them. The characters' special powers also go with their personalities quite well and in unexpectedly hilarious ways. Ellie, for instance, can water sprouts to make them grow (because she's a paleobotanist, you see) and jump into giant piles of dino poop to find useful things (because other characters can't stand the smell). And the open world bits fit right into the theme park conceit perfectly, though it doesn't work quite as well in The Lost World and Jurassic Park III since the settings are just more wilderness. But the big draw with Lego Jurassic World is the fact that you can play as the dinosaurs themselves. Here, you get to embody the famous dinos we all found so fascinating as kids, like the velociraptor and, of course, the star of the franchise, the T-Rex. It's great to be given go many options to play, especially once you get through the main game and just want to unravel as much of what's still out there as you can. The problem is that you can't actually experiment with anything in any real sense. The different abilities are simply keys to unlock progress or secrets. You never get the chance to noodle around with the mechanics or improvise since there's always just one solution to every obstacle the game puts in your way. Another unfortunate side effect of this approach is the fact that the things you're doing in-game aren't nearly as interesting as the things your in-game avatar is doing. She might be performing a high-pitched scream to break some glass in your way or building a giant replica of a hot dog to distract a rampaging dino. In reality, you're moving from one spot in a level to another, where you activate a thing that lets you move on to the next thing, and so on. Granted, this is the baseline for how game levels are built at their core, but Traveller's Tales does nothing to hide this pattern, nor does it add any complexity to how scenarios play out. It's all focused on throwing exactly one obstacle at you at a time with very little stopping you in between. This makes for adventuring that is bereft of tension and friction, leading to a game you just stroll through with very little resistance. Iconic scenes are replicated as Lego-built levels, like when Lex and Tim try to evade hungry velociraptors in a kitchen or a T-Rex stampeding through San Diego as Jeff Goldblum speeds in front of it. While it's quite pleasing to stroll through these set pieces as you progress through the game, you never feel like you're in danger in the slightest. The reason the velociraptor scene is timeless is the ever-present danger of the kids being found, the unsettling purring noise the raptors make, approaching closer and closer until the children are right under their noses. In Lego Jurassic World, no such tension exists. Again, you have to find the right thing to fiddle with to move on to the next section to find the next thing and repeat the process until you make it to the end. In the meantime, the two raptors are “looking” for you, but they never actually move from their pre-determined spots except to pace uselessly until you trigger their next movement. If you attempt to move close to them, the kids back away looking cautious and frightened--an inelegant cover for the dreaded invisible wall. Suddenly, you're not playing Lego versions of your favorite scenes but instead find yourself as the cast of a badly-acted Lego play where you can see the stagehands changing the scenery. The only potential source of tension that the game tries to throw at you is when it occasionally sends a swarm of tiny dinos (or occasionally other Lego people) to attack you, but even this is hollow. Your punch attack is a pathetic wiggle that you have to be right next to an enemy to use. But everything goes down in one hit, so when things swarm at you, you merely have to mash the button as you move around and try not to get hit--and even that doesn't work, as an enemy might land a lucky shot on you as you're moving. The tepid combat makes any enemy encounter annoying, especially when they start pouring infinitely out of a hole until you plug it up. Notably, only the first movie's set of stages is completely bereft of combat segments, and it's all the better for it. Don't get me wrong, though: Lego Jurassic World absolutely has its heart in the right place. Every scene is injected with the now-trademark Lego sense of humor. Events like seeing Chris Pratt gleefully play with toy dinosaurs during a tense scene or seeing someone's hair fall off and land on a raptor's head always produce a chuckle at worst. It helps that you have the very serious lines from the original movies juxtaposed with your silly Lego people doing ridiculous things. Unfortunately, the audio from the movies wasn't mixed very well with the game audio, which sounds jarring next to the pristine, polished sounds and voices recorded for the game. Luckily, the funniest aspect of the game requires no voice acting at all: the dinosaurs. They don't talk, so all their humor is relayed in pantomime, a trick not seen in Traveller's Tales Lego games since their earliest efforts. Since so much of the Lego multimedia experience relies on visual humor, the dinosaurs make up the lion's share of funny moments, like raptors chasing a tiny ice cream truck or the hybrid T-Rex from Jurassic World forming emoticons with bones from its pen. It really speaks to the strength of the game's charm and humor that the non-speaking dinosaurs steal the show, but then again, they are the stars of the Jurassic Park franchise, so it's appropriate. The Lego games set out to create an accessible, joy-filled romp through our favorite pieces of popular media with as few barriers stopping the fun as possible. They are part of one of the few franchises that can get by on charm alone. But Traveller's Tales take this approach to extremes, focusing on the visual and thematic experience almost entirely while letting the actual gameplay languish. Jurassic Park in particular doesn't suit this design because flattening the mechanics removes all notions of tension from the game, an essential part of the film series. Lego Jurassic Park is a nice, pleasant nostalgia trip, but it won't be long before you're asking to leave."
711,My Time At Portia,6.0,1,"Portia has a distinctly post-apocalyptic feel, which lends a sense of intrigue to what would otherwise have been a familiar traversal of yet another sleepy town to be spiced up by the voiceless city-slicker of a player-character. The game paints a tidy, watercolor-inspired picture that wouldn't be out of place on a postcard; a ""wish you were here"" would fit nicely against the giant, scraped-out husks of metal that loom over lush fields and quaint cottages like relics from a bygone age. In fact, they are: Humanity in My Time at Portia is said to have gotten too ambitious in the past by exploiting technology and science to reach lofty heights that it was struck down for. Now, it's back to the Agrarian Age for the foreseeable future, and you're the closest they've got to Noah and the Ark.These monolithic reminders dot the various landscapes of My Time at Portia, and they're an effective and unintrusive way to ensure you're clued into the broader message around hubris leading to the apocalypse. It makes for an interesting plot device, which would be well-utilized if it went beyond making the world more visually interesting, or even beyond the inclusion of one faction of NPCs dedicated to keeping the town of Portia back in the comparative Dark Ages. But that's about as far as it goes: aesthetic as opposed to substance. No storylines really pursue it, nor do the townsfolk seem to care. You're not provided with the opportunity to engage meaningfully with the setpiece of the world's past, which is a shame given how interesting it seems.Instead, the majority of the experience remains relatively familiar and unbroken by a loop of crafting, fighting, and gathering missions. The crafting system is the game's real treat, though. As the child of a master-builder, you're given access very early on to plans created by your father. These plans function like crafting blueprints; they stay on your person as you romp around the world in search of materials, and you can easily refer to them and check exactly how much tin ore you need to convert into whatever arbitrary amount of bronze bars you need to prop a bridge up.You're also given the ability to use a crafting station back at your house which tells you exactly what you're missing to build a particular item. There's no need for guesswork, and you also get to visually appreciate the nitty-gritty of what you're building as completing various parts of items sees them come to life before your eyes on the workbench. This wonderfully intuitive approach ties neatly into what you're told is the protagonist's innate skill as a crafter, which means that you spend less time wondering how many rocks you have to crack open and more time thinking about the next great creation taking shape in your backyard.Crafting is also the only aspect of the game that feels integral to actually getting anywhere with the story--everything is expensive, and the most effective way to make money is to grind out crafting items to sell. But while the reliance on grinding isn't a surprise if you're a genre fan, the combination of quick day-night cycles in the game, timed quests, and the time commitment needed to actually get anything crafted is a recipe for dissatisfaction. Time feels like it crawls by unless you're occupying yourself with busywork, which unfortunately ends up detracting from the charm of the lively hustle and bustle of the town of Portia.However, while the crafting is robust and an essential part of your experience with My Time at Portia, the other integrated systems--relationship management, dungeoneering, animal husbandry, and farming--aren't as engaging, fleshed out, or vital by comparison. Being able to gift your way to a perfect marriage does a disservice to some of the unique personalities that you can court, and you feel discouraged from spending time on farming because of how time-consuming and expensive it is to acquire enough land to turn those parsnips into a profit. The main story forces you to invest heavily in crafting and once you’ve tried your hand at the carpentry trade, it can be hard to look elsewhere when the demands of time and money limit your ability to engage in the other systems.Among the cacophony of mechanics, there's a wistfulness for depth. An upgrade system has you picking various skills, ranging from increased experience gain to a higher chance of getting more items, each time you level up. But it's hard to actually feel the effect of these perks, and there isn't one clear build which gives you a significantly better performance over the rest. Min-maxing attributes is rarely the point of lifestyle sims, so it makes sense that rewards seem more like a little bit of gas in the tank rather than a whole new engine. But failing to actually use your skill points on anything is unlikely to disadvantage you at all, which cheapens the purpose behind giving you a mountain of options in the first place. Being a little bit more efficient at carrying out objectives in a game that's all about repetitive grinding isn't a bad thing, but you find yourself wishing that the improvements afforded to you were more significant for the time invested.Your time at Portia is likely going to be an idyllic one, interspersed with chores and chatter and putting household items together for your neighbors. You'll spend your time idly dangling your legs off the edge of the pier, participating in fishing tourneys, ushering in holidays with your partner, and fending off local wildlife. However, the ruins of a time long forgotten will always darken the horizon, and there'll be a part of you that wonders what more there could have been before you find yourself shunted to the next life goal in a long series of life goals. That feeling is unfortunately hard to shake, and it's a shame that there's not as much to the world of Portia as first appears."
1162,Snake Pass,7.0,2,"Playing a 3D platformer without a jump button is a strange experience. When I first started Snake Pass, I felt lost without the warm blanket of a double jump. How do I get to that floating platform across the chasm? How am I supposed to change direction after I screw up my initial movement? And just how am I to obtain that arbitrary hard-to-reach shiny collectible?!Answering these questions is easy once you realize that Snake Pass requires you to not only move like a snake, but think like a snake. Initially, I struggled to adapt to my lack of legs (I've grown quite attached to my limbs, you see): falling from the top of high peaks, slithering straight off rocky cliffs, and slamming into walls were sights seen far too often--making much of the mid-game more frustrating than enjoyable. But somehow, things clicked, and slinking up a pole to reach an objective became a natural and strangely beautiful movement, and one that distinguishes Snake Pass as a platformer like no other.You play as Noodle, a vegetarian snake, joined by Doodle, your hummingbird companion. Like Yooka-Laylee, Snake Pass has clearly been inspired by late 90s platformers such as Banjo-Kazooie, but rather than simply retread what has come before, its central mechanic aims to innovate. Unfortunately, while Noodle and Doodle have cute names and appear full of character, their voices and personalities--or lack thereof--don't quite have the charm of the aforementioned Rare mascots or other popular mascot creatures.The joy, then, must come from Snake Pass's mechanics. Make no mistake, this is a game about momentum, and about 'feel;' about how well developer Sumo Digital can translate being a serpent onto a gamepad. Initially, this is taught well, with easier obstacles and smaller enclosures allowing you to get to grips with your new boa constrictor body. You're afforded the time and a safe environment to learn how to wrap your body around poles, how to accelerate across flat ground (you actually have to move side-to-side), and how to successfully climb upwards. Unfortunately, the mid-game's difficulty curve is steep. There are no enemies in Snake Pass, but each of the game's four main worlds introduces new fatal, obstacles; ravines, spikes, lava, and more stand between you and three keystones, which you need to collect to open the exit portal in each level. At this stage, you're still acclimatizing to life on no feet, and yet Snake Pass expects you to run before you can wriggle.There are other problems, too. Your airborne friend Doodle is supposed to be able to pick up your tail end to give you an upwards boost, but he'll frequently refuse to help when called upon. I now have a mild hatred towards hummingbirds as a result.The camera's positioning is also an issue, as it often picks the wrong angle to show you as you're attempting to curl yourself around the next piece of connective bamboo. Far too often you'll need to manually move your viewpoint, and combined with the separate buttons for forward movement, lateral movement, vertical movement, and gripping, all of which are frequently being pushed at the same time, it can feel like you're tying yourself in a knot.However, when your serpentine abilities catch up with the difficulty curve a little further in, Snake Pass transforms. You learn which movements to pull off to stay wrapped around a peg--when to tighten your muscles, when to lift your head up, and when to realize the game is up and it's best to skip to the next moving platform. As you improve, the momentum you build in gliding up and over obstacles can lead to some wonderful sights--there's something instinctively satisfying about seeing a snake's tail chase after its head, especially knowing you were the choreographer. And that's helped by the vibrant character and environment art, the latter of which accentuates each world's natural beauty, while the changing color palettes make each level appear distinct from the last. This is a game whose sense of motion is palpable, with platforms whizzing by and moving reptilian stripes attracting the eye--and yet I often found myself gazing at a distant treeline or glowing collectible orb. Maybe I wouldn't have died so much if I'd been paying attention...Snake Pass's artistry extends into its soundtrack. Each track fits its world perfectly--ramping up tension when necessary--but mostly the panpipes and steel drums add to the exotic peace already hinted at by the game's appearance. It meant that even in that difficult middle period, even when I was frustrated at having died at the same obstacle for the fifth time, I rarely wanted to chuck my controller out the window.At times, then, Snake Pass can be a wonderfully relaxing journey through some beautiful habitats. The late game switches into an engaging and challenging puzzler, requiring some deft flicks of the left stick, but one that can feel immensely gratifying when you elegantly slalom your way over a narrow assault course that's suspended over lava. It's the middle third, when the game expects too much of you far too soon, that causes the momentum to stutter. Nevertheless, Snake Pass is a quirky puzzler that innovates while simultaneously evoking memories of your favourite platformers of yesteryear--just don't expect to grow into your new skin overnight."
4630,Damnation,4.0,0,"  Damnation's biggest accomplishment is making steampunk look bad. Even the usually cool mashing up of fantasy and sci-fi can't save developer Blue Omega Entertainment's mess of a third-person shooter. Aside from the intriguing alt-history setting that combines robots with the Civil War, everything about this game is inept. Combat is a dreary repetitive-motion exercise where you clumsily gun down enemies who have the intelligence of ducks in carnival shooting games. Ugly, convoluted levels see you acting like some kind of cowboy take on Spider-Man and leaping around buildings that make about as much architectural sense as the girder levels in Donkey Kong. And the remaining minimal entertainment has also been bled out of the game by hideous graphics, choppy frame rates, and screechy sound effects.        The steampunk storyline is poorly set up as well. You play an outlaw named Hamilton Rourke, a member of a rebel gang at large in an alternate 19th-century America where steam-powered high-technology robots and weapons were introduced during the Civil War. An evil industrialist named Prescott has taken charge of the country thanks to legions of robots and a serum that gives soldiers super strength, and it's your job is to take him down. All of this gives the game's settings a sinister atmosphere akin to that of a Wild West take on the ruined City 17 in Half-Life 2. Some levels even feature Prescott speaking on a loudspeaker, waxing philosophically about the destruction of whole cities and how he is the only way back to peace. Lots of steampunk trappings litter the levels, including giant airships, powerful sci-fi weapons, robot soldiers, and creepy enemies that look like a combination of WWI trench grunts and the Combine storm troopers from Half-Life 2. But these elements are never formed into a coherent whole. The background story behind these fantastic events remains a mystery. All you get are a few flashes of strange newspaper articles and photos, along with some quick cutscenes that depict Prescott as a bad, bad man.     But you won't care much about the story behind Damnation for very long. The gameplay is so trite and repetitive that you quickly go from curiosity to get-me-the-hell-out-of-here boredom. Instead of the fluidity that characterizes the best shooters, the pace here is choppy and awkward. Most of the time, you simply race along unopposed, with the main source of interest being the ability to leap up or down the faces of buildings and shimmy up flagpoles. This can be intriguing in spots. Intuitive controls make it easy to pull off some amazing leaps and backflips. With just a quick two-button combo, you can fly through the air backward and flip around to grab hold of a ledge or bounce off one wall to leap up to a ledge. Many levels are structured like erector-set puzzles, with you having to figure out how to vault and climb your way to the top of teetering towers. Still, it's all absolutely absurd. Many buildings are so gutted and wrecked that they would collapse long before you got perform your Cirque du Soleil stunts in them, while others simply couldn't stand up because of the way they were designed even while totally intact. All you can really say for the ability to leap around and the odd architecture is that, at least, the developers tried to move beyond the generic linear shooter.     But in the end, it doesn't work. All of the mildly entertaining derring-do is constantly interrupted. It's as if the designers realized at the last minute that they were supposed to be making a shooter, so they brought all the leaping and gallivanting to a crashing halt by stocking the levels with dumb ambushes. As a result, one moment you're dancing about like an acrobat in buckskins, then the next moment, you're hunkered down behind cover for three or four minutes, only peeking out every so often to rip off a couple of shots at the dozen bad guys who have suddenly popped up in front of you. None of these shooting sequences are the least bit enjoyable. Enemies simply stand in one spot blasting away at you or move mindlessly in and out of shelter like targets in shooting galleries. Baddies also take a stupid amount of punishment, leaving you to blast away a dozen rounds with the game's small selection of wimpy weapons before they finally bite the dust. The only challenge is to your patience. You can easily get so annoyed with constantly taking cover from the barrage of enemy bullets that you jump out into the open to try to get things over with quickly...but instead, you just wind up getting killed.     Controls are screwy whether you're playing on a console or on the PC. Aiming is awkward with both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 gamepads because the movement of the sticks is imprecise when targeting enemies. PC controls are even worse because you never know when you'll be able to use the mouse or have to hit the keyboard. This is particularly annoying in the menus because it seems like the developers flipped a coin when deciding how to activate buttons. While one function is available by hitting the left mouse button, the very next requires you to hit the Enter key. Also, some standard shooter controls are unavailable, such as using the mousewheel to select a weapon. None of this really gets in the way of controlling Rourke, although that's probably because the underlying gameplay is so irritating it's hard to niggle over a few control flaws that are minor by comparison.        Visuals and sound are loaded with problems on all three platforms. Each version of the game regularly chugs during gameplay and cutscenes. The Xbox 360 and PC versions are probably the worst offenders, with the 360 stumbling through cutscenes and the PC displaying a lot of tearing. Textures are embarrassingly behind the times, many buildings display a jaggy, blurry wallpaper effect, and special effects are terribly animated. Enemy heads explode in a shower of gore, yet intact skulls are clearly visible when the bloody spray clears. Enemies caught in explosions are gibbed a split second before the kaboom even goes off. The voice acting is atrocious, although it's hard to imagine even a reincarnated Olivier doing much with the script's cast of stereotypes. For example, there is an Indian mystic who speaks generic Indian gibberish about his destiny; a cowardly, chauvinistic Mexican; and a stock shooter babe who wears a ludicrous top that reveals a good inch or two of bottom breast. Sound effects are arguably even more annoying than the voices. Enemy weapon fire frequently consists of an obnoxious, metallic noise that sounds a whole lot like somebody dragging a chain over a sewer grate. Oh, and the multiplayer is worthless. Co-op support is present--although it's absolutely wasted on a game with so few merits--along with a bunch of standard shooter game modes, such as Deathmatch and King of the Hill. At any rate, nobody is playing the game online, so you'll have to use some other way to find out if misery really loves company.     You have to give Blue Omega credit for trying something different with Damnation's steampunk story and its leaping-around action, but that's about it. Everything else here is painful to experience.    "
1196,Urban Empire,6.0,1,"For better and worse, Urban Empire lets you explore that idea--or, at least, more than some of its iconic cousins. SimCity, for example, lets you take the reins of a nascent city, but it came with some huge limitations in terms of what sorts of decision-making powers you can wield. Urban Empire unshackles you, but in so doing gives you a sobering dose of reality. As the leader of your city, you can push for women's rights or abolish child-labor laws--but you're always at the behest of a fickle city council. That addition makes Urban Empire one of the most realistic (and, at times, most frustrating) city-building simulators around.When the game starts, you'll have unchecked power, taking control of a political family with blessings from the emperor of the fictional country Swarelia. You can't be removed from office, and you can't run dry on money, either. If you get into trouble, you can run to the emperor and get a fat check and an easy bailout--though you'll lose a bit of political clout. Beyond that, you're free to push for whatever improvements and projects you'd like. Along the way, however, you'll also be making decisions about how you, personally, live your life. You may choose to send your eldest child (and your future successor) to a boarding school abroad, which could affect their reputation years down the line. That gives you a strong tie not only to the city you build, but also to the narrative of your family across many generations.You'll also be in charge of zoning and organizing new districts, as well as deciding which types of technologies to bring to your fine city. As you progress, you can unlock sewage, electricity, and new types of roads, all the way up to robotics and sci-fi-inspired gizmos. Each new district will have an up-front cost to build out the necessary infrastructure, and then monthly maintenance that you'll have to keep in check as you turn on more and more services. That tension between the cost of different services and infrastructure upgrades, your own goals, and the capriciousness of the council members (each of whom have their own constituents to appease) is an excellent, sturdy foundation for this management sim.Running water for all sounds nice, but unless your city is packed tight, it's a tough expenditure to justify. And even if you do have the money, you'll first have to propose whatever change you want to make, and then wait a few months as the city council deliberates on the change. As they bicker, you can spend political goodwill, call in favors, or make sweeping threats to sway the parties--each of which comes with consequences. It's a complex (albeit exhausting) system that reflects the struggles of politicians at almost every level of government.As political parties evolve, their core values will twist and morph, until they've splintered into their component factions. While these shifts are unfortunately the same for each campaign, limiting replayability, they do provide an engaging challenge and an organic system for ramping up difficulty. To ram through critical legislation, you may need to play one group off another, making and breaking alliances as you go. This goes double for controversial social policies where you can't always make an easy-to-grasp economic case. As a general rule, though, if the city is prospering and you're well liked, you won't have much trouble getting your work done. The issue is that as you play, you're repeatedly reminded that understanding the city's well-being can be so difficult as to seem random--at least at first.Most of your time with Urban Empire will be spent monitoring your cash flow. At first, these numbers will be pretty easy to manage--a few grand each month, slotted straight into the city's coffers. But Urban Empire begins during the industrial revolution, an era notorious for political and economic instability, and shocks to your municipal economy will come fast and hit hard, often jarring your income substantially in either direction. Those fluctuations appear random--and, to be sure, some are--but if you dig a bit, you'll often find some sort of economic bottleneck. A district you built early on might be struggling to cope with excessive traffic, limiting productivity, or an industrial sector may need a power plant and electrical grid to stay competitive.Urban Empire supplies you with all the data you need to find these hiccups--or, rather, it tries to. You can (and should) drill down to individual businesses and homes to see everything from the area's political makeup to its business climate. Different edicts and ordinances will cause shifts in supply and demand, and that works in concert with your city's external connections--like rail stations and ports--to generate the simulation of your city's economic performance. That data can be tedious to sort through, and there's not much in the way of tools to monitor broad sections of the city. Everything gets organized by district, and that can make it tough to determine how different areas are working together or what's driving different types of demand.Making matters worse is a nebulous, unpredictable blob of bugs that will, at some point, obfuscate critical information. Many edicts and technologies will show you a summary of their costs and effects if you hover the mouse over them, but that information won't appear at unpredictable points. Sometimes you can close the game and restart to get it back on screen, but once in a while, Urban Empire will crash at the main menu. These issues aren't killers, but they're annoying and have no place in a retail game.Bugs aside, one solution to overabundance of information is actually simple, and it's something Urban Empire already does--but only for some of its features. Different tools are gated off based on your technological progress. For example, you cannot start with differential taxation. You're stuck raising or lowering taxes on businesses and citizens until you've done the social research needed to tax industry--for example--at a higher rate than corporations. That keeps parts of the game hidden away until you've developed more familiarity with how things work. The problem is that not everything in the game works like this, and as you move through time, you'll be saddled with an enormous amount of management that doesn't get a proper introduction or a safe means of experimenting with different effects. This tendency causes some major difficulty spikes that take far too long to overcome.At the same time, many of these features come across as intentional. Playing the game doesn't quite feel fatalistic, but it does seem to bludgeon players with the idea that politicking is harder than most of us will admit. To that end, Urban Empire is quite the achievement. It's incredible to watch your own political empire collapse or thrive based on the butterfly effect of decisions both big and small.Urban Empire is a trying game, but there's beauty in how it captures the many obstacles that plague political life, but it’s still marred by instances of poor execution and an unwieldy user interface. Still, if you've ever wanted to know what a more realistic, less tongue-in-cheek rendition of SimCity would be like, you could do a lot worse. If you're willing to spend the time, Urban Empire has a lot to show you, but it comes with its share of annoyances."
3449,Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty,10.0,2,"  Some sequels radically reinvent what has come before; others simply buff up a formula that already soars. To suggest that Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty does only the latter and not the former would be to sell short the fresh ideas and exciting gameplay that makes this superb real-time strategy sequel so enjoyable. This package delivers more than simple fun--it serves up incredible amounts of variety, from the cinematic and multifaceted campaign to the competitive and tightly balanced multiplayer. You might scoff at the fact that the game only includes a single campaign and, perhaps, at the high price point (the game retails at $59.99; $10 higher than the average PC game). But these are nitpicks, forgivable quibbles in a high-quality game that provides plenty of bang for the buck. Starcraft II is the natural next step for the series: it both embraces and updates the core components that made the first game a huge hit while layering on important features that give the game endless replay value, both online and off. This is one of the finest real-time strategy games in years, and whether you're new to the genre or have been studying Protoss build orders for the past decade, there's something here to delight you.        The campaign is the first of many of these delights. You may have heard that Starcraft II features only a single campaign: that of the human faction known as the Terrans. One of the game's few disappointments is that the other two factions--the Protoss and the Zerg--don't get their day in the sun, so if you're a newcomer who wants to prove your superiority (or inferiority) online, don't expect the campaign to prepare you for the potential onslaught. But the campaign is hardly a one-note wonder, offering loads of variety, including an entire set of missions that divulges important story elements from an entirely different perspective. Yet even outside of those devious missions, you accomplish diverse and interesting tasks throughout the story. In one early mission, lava periodically rises onto the mainland, posing a threat to any units not positioned on high ground. In another, an exploding sun causes a deadly wall of flame to steadily push you across the map. From one mission to the next, there's an intriguing new development that keeps you devoted to seeing what surprise is waiting for you next.                This Battle.net interface has its drawbacks. In order to play the game at all, you must create a Battle.net account and associate it with your game key. To earn achievements--even those in the single-player modes--you must be signed in to your account, which means always remaining online. (Fortunately, you can play the campaign as a guest when not signed into your Battle.net account, though you won't earn any rewards that way.) And though you can indicate that you are unavailable and block other users, you cannot make yourself invisible to the players on your friends list if you aren't in a social mood. Starcraft II is an intrinsically social experience. When friends receive achievements, you get a notification, which might drive a bit of friendly competition. You unlock and select from various user icons, which identify you to your friends and to your multiplayer rivals. You select which achievements you want to show off to anyone viewing your profile. And if you aren't sure which of your friends might be playing, the game will search your Facebook friends list and automatically send an invite to anyone with a Battle.net account. The social integration, the achievement notifications, and the intuitive and smooth interface make Battle.net--usually--a positive way of interfacing with Starcraft II.        StarCraft II is a competitive game of the highest order, and as such, it offers a fully featured online experience that is as thrilling as it is grueling. It begins with choosing the faction that best suits your play style. Every race offers versatility within its own units, and any number of strategies could be key to your success. If you play as Protoss, you might become enamored with the ominous flying void rays, which destroy both ground and air units with a focused beam of energy. But an enemy with a ready counter (say, Terran marines) might take advantage of the void's need to charge up before it fires. The Zerg are well known for facilitating rush tactics, but if you face a zergling rush as a Terran, flame-spewing hellions may be your answer. There are great opportunities for satisfying micromanagement with each race, whether that means using the Protoss phoenix to lift ground units into the sky or transforming soaring Terran vikings into assault walkers. Each of the three factions possesses its own strengths and weaknesses, but there are so many different ways of approaching the battle that you need to stay flexible, scout the enemy, and respond accordingly.      These units and strategies make Starcraft II very similar to its predecessor. You won't see the drastic changes seen in the most recent Dawn of War and Command &amp; Conquer games; Starcraft II is a highly traditional RTS. But you shouldn't discount the tweaks, the minor changes, and the additions and subtractions that differentiate this sequel from what came before. The larvaelike Protoss reaver, for example, was jettisoned in favor of the looming colossus, a thin-legged walker that razes ground units with a buzzing beam. (A group of them climbing over a short cliff into your base is a terrifying sight.) The Terran thor is a mechanical mass of limbs and missile launchers that can take on both air and ground units. (Their unit responses also sound suspiciously like Arnold Schwarzenegger.) On the Zerg side, nydus worms allow quick underground travel, and unlike the original game's nydus canals, they can be placed anywhere in your line of sight. Starcraft II will surely see some unit tweaks in the coming months, but even at this stage, the factions seem remarkably balanced, and every unit has an appropriate reply. You might miss your favorite units from the original, but the new ones are every bit as fun to use.        The amount of content available in online play (and in offline play in skirmish mode) is remarkable. There are dozens of maps that support up 12 players, and matches can be tailored in the usual ways--grouping players into different teams, setting the game speed, and so on. You might group up with friends and conspire to take down an all-AI team or try your hand at a desperate six-player free-for-all. However, to show off your strategizing prowess, you'll want to get into ranked league matches, which is as easy as playing a series of games to determine which league you'll be placed in and then inching your way to the top. If this sounds intimidating, don't worry; you can take part in up to 50 slow-paced preliminary matches to get yourself prepared for the big boys.        Little Big Planet, but there are already a good number of custom maps and modes to download, and there are assuredly many, many more on their way. But even without a burgeoning supply of user-created content, Starcraft II would stand on its own as a true gem, providing strategy veterans with a tournament-focused online package while easing newcomers in with easier difficulty levels, offline challenges, and even a friendly introduction to competitive play. The campaign's focus on the Terrans and a few scattered inconveniences aren't great nuisances--not in an RTS as outstanding as this one. Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty is not just an old game with a pretty new face. It's a varied and full-featured jewel that will keep you stuck to your computer chair for weeks, months, and even years to come.      "
4563,Xiaolin Showdown,4.0,0,"  While there's something to be said for the accessibility of simple, straightforward games, it's the notion that kids can't handle or appreciate more sophisticated games, or media in general, that causes mindless trash like Xiaolin Showdown to come to bear. It's based on the unremarkable children's cartoon of the same name, which would be indistinguishable from the numerous other post-Powerpuff Girls action comedy cartoons out there were it not for the way it also clumsily cops a broadly Asian theme that ranges from old kung-fu movies to Dragon Ball Z. Uninspired source material aside, Xiaolin Showdown is still a crummy excuse for a four-player, arena-based brawler that's weighed down by a poorly realized lock-on system, crushingly monotonous enemy designs, and crude visuals.        You'll play Xiaolin Showdown as one of the four monks-in-training from the show--the diminutive Omi, the brash Raimundo, the fiery Kimiko, and the gentle giant Clay. Despite their divergent appearances, there's little functional difference. The game supports up to four players, though if you're playing on your own you'll be joined by three computer-controlled characters. The additional fighters make the scene a bit livelier, but it's also a major source of tedium, due to a lousy lock-on system, which makes it all too easy to target friendly characters. The game indicates whom you're locked onto by placing a column of light above the character, but the light flash is too brief, and it's oddly difficult to disengage the lock once you're already homed in. You have two basic attack buttons that you can mash into multihit combos, and you can also leap around and pick up barrels and jugs to throw at enemies. But because the lock-on system doesn't work particularly well, the easiest way to best your opponents is to jump in the air and repeatedly perform the basic homing attack. Your fighting style doesn't evolve much over the course of the adventure mode, but the effectiveness of this basic air attack makes many of your other attacks null and void.     You'll travel to a series of arena-shaped environments and do battle with the minions of evil boy-genius Jack Spicer, of which there are three different types for you to fight over the course of the game. Before you go into a new level, you can equip your character with up to three different forms of Shen Gong Wu, which is basically a fancy, trademarkable name for ""special move."" The Shen Gong Wu, which you have to charge up by collecting colored spheres that fall out of your enemies, can have varying effects. The most common effect is to stun and immobilize enemies within a small radius, making it easier to beat the snot out of them. As with the lock-on system, though, your comrades can get caught up in the effects of the Shen Gong Wu, and the stun effects can be surprisingly long-lasting. Or maybe it just seems that way when you find yourself stuck in a giant block of ice, thanks to one of your buddies, unable to do anything for a good five or 10 seconds.      As irritating as the game is most of the time, there are some side games where the ability to take on the other monks makes some kind of sense. As you punch the same generic-looking robots over and over again, new forms of Shen Gong Wu will show up in the arena. A new form isn't simply granted to the person who grabs it first; everyone is forced to compete in a Xiaolin Showdown to see who gets it. The showdowns, which can also be played separately from the adventure mode, stick to familiar formats, such as king of the hill, keep-away, and a game of tag where you want to avoid being ""it"" for the longest amount of time. If you want to raise the stakes, you can put one of the Shen Gong Wu that you've already earned on the line, and if you win the showdown, you'll get to steal a Shen Gong Wu from one of the other players. It's a slight break from the game's usual tedium, but it's still plagued by the same crummy lock-on system as the rest of the adventure mode.        For as totally bland and derivative as the gameplay in Xiaolin Showdown is, at least the presentation is colorful. The novelty of cel-shading may have worn off years ago, though it still helps reinforce Xiaolin Showdown's animated source material. That said, the environments are small, the characters are simple and repetitive, and the textures are pretty chunky looking. Several of the voice actors from the show put in time here, including industry vets Tom Kenny and Maurice LaMarche, though it's the character of Dojo, the friendly, wisecracking dragon, that got the most time on the microphone. He's not voiced by Wayne Knight (aka Newman) as he is in the show; instead, the duties fell to a stand-in whose voice grates on the nerves, an effect that's exacerbated by voice clips that repeat ad nauseam. The game appears on the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and PSP, but aside from the minor differences you can expect from the systems, the versions are functionally identical.     There's something really condescending about Xiaolin Showdown. Whenever a new objective appears, the game comes to a screeching halt, and even if you've seen this type of objective a dozen times before, the game still explains what you're supposed to do, in painstaking detail, every single time. Additionally, it seems to be impossible to run out of health in Xiaolin Showdown, a suspicion that's backed up by the fact that there are no meters of any kind onscreen as you play. The game's disrespect for the intelligence of the player and its stale gameplay are sufficient reasons to avoid what is essentially a cynical marketing product.  "
1734,The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask,9.0,2,"The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D to Nintendo's other foray into handheld Zelda remakes, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D. Ocarina of Time's upgrades for the 3DS significantly improved the experience; artfully placed Sheikah Stones offered visions and showed where and how to solve the next puzzle, and the 3DS's gyroscope added motion controls to certain actions, such as shooting arrows. These additions were designed to make the game accessible to modern audiences and more palatable for short play sessions. For 3DS, Majora's Mask was retooled to be friendlier in shorter player sessions, with great success. A more detailed quest log lets you keep track of every completed, uncompleted, and rumored item on your to-do list. You can set alarms to remind you when certain events will occur. Small tweaks to how songs affect time and the flow of boss battles give you deeper control of time itself, while the rearrangement of collectible items throughout dungeons and the overworld make Majora's Mask feel fresh for those coming back after 15 years. Majora's Mask is inarguably the weirdest Legend of Zelda game. Sometime shortly after the events of Ocarina of Time, our hero Link wanders into a country called Termina. Hyrule it is not: The ominously named region is home to an eerie cast of characters and hosts an inordinate number of strange happenings. An erratic mask salesman hoarding cursed objects? We've got one. Alien abductions? Frequent. Ghost hands in toilets and ghost giants throwing boulders and ghosts doing tai chi on huge mushrooms? More common that you'd like. Groundhog Day redux. Time management is the name of the game here. Anytime during the 72-hour window, you can play the Song of Time to rewind back to dawn of the first day. Having this limit means you must allot yourself ample time to clear regional quests and complete dungeons. In each area, what you do in the surrounding area directly affects your access to the dungeon and side quests, so you'll need those full 72 hours. In one region the town is iced over, and defeating the dungeon boss is the only way to restore spring. In spring you have access to a handful of smaller missions that in turn reveal more major gains, like upping your sword power and finding your long-lost horse. Once, I completed this dungeon and then immediately rewound back to the first day...only to find it all frozen again. It's this kind of thing you need to be mindful of as you play Majora's Mask, and forces you to forgo leisurely exploration in favoring of beelining between quest points. Like in most Legend of Zelda games, extensive travel across the continent and back is required to collect special items. These items range from a bigger bag to carry your bombs to a bow and arrows and everything in between. The traditional Zelda gear accumulation formula is present: help NPCs to gain helpful combat items, complete dungeons to get useful items like the aforementioned bow and fire arrows, and beat the dungeon boss to collect a key item. But other than mystical weapons and keys to defeating the game's ultimate enemy--the power of Majora's Mask--you're also on the hunt for masks. Masks do many special things, and, more often than not, donning one can solve a difficult problem. A Blast Mask allows you to explode an enemy or rock wall without using bombs. The Great Fairy mask attracts stray fairies to you, making them easier to collect. Another mask teaches people to dance, another charms animals into parading around after you, and yet another lets you run faster and jump longer. Still more transform you into other Termina races. The Deku Mask turns you into a Deku Scrub and lets you utilize cannon-like flowers and glide through the air, while the Goron Mask grants you powerful punching abilities and the race's stony look. Masks grant you situational powers and are the key to navigating most puzzles. The variety and versatility make it hard to resist taking time to collect them all, especially when you know they'll make life in Termina easier. When you're not exploring the overworld, running fetch-quests for various townsfolk and mask hunting, you're in dungeons. Majora's Mask features four main dungeons and a handful of mini-dungeons where you can collect rare items like bigger wallets and mystical Zora eggs. Dungeons are the same as they've always been in Zelda: make your way through a labyrinthine, multi-level temple solving environment puzzles to get to the final boss. Defeating this final boss yields a health upgrade and liberates one of the four spirits that can help stop the moon from falling. Puzzles make up the meat of dungeon content, but you still spend an awful lot of time fighting. Combat in Majora's Mask is simple. You use the left analog stick and face buttons to stab, slash, and parry, while the shoulder buttons help you block with your shield and lock on to enemies. The ability to lock on to enemies is helpful, as some opponents can crawl up onto the ceiling or leap long lengths, and keeping track of them becomes tricky. Boss battles in Majora's Mask 3D have been substantially fixed, and while they feel more manageable than they did in the Nintendo 64 version, they aren't necessarily easier. These fights have been adjusted to prevent you from exploiting the boss's attack pattern, meaning that they won't always do the same thing with the same regularity in the same way. You need to knock bosses over and then attack their weak spots three times before you're victorious, but this time around, it's harder to sneak in cheap hits when they don't follow the same attack, rinse, and repeat formula. It makes these long fights feel new and interesting and makes success more satisfying. For example, the first dungeon boss can summon waves of smaller critters. The first time this happened, it was a handful of beetles. I expected him to go back to attacking me without his minions, but half a minute later, I had beetles and moths to contend with. Then he went back to attacking me solo until the end of the fight. While bosses haven't been made easier, some other areas have been. There are more save points throughout the world, mercifully saving you from long stretches of lost progress in the event you fail. The Song of Soaring allows you to teleport to any save point, and now there are more of them to make navigation easier. Additionally, the Song of Double Time lets you fast forward to whatever hour you choose within a same-day window. In the original game, this song only let you fast-forward to dawn or dusk; in the 3DS version, you can teleport to any hour on the hour, allowing you to more carefully manage how and when you complete tasks. This also comes in handy when you just want to quickly wrap up a few side quests before rewinding to the first day and tackling a dungeon. Even smaller changes make Majora's Mask 3D more digestible in small quantities and make the puzzles feel newer for repeat players. Scattered throughout each dungeon are a dozen or so stray fairies that can be returned to the region's Great Fairy for combat upgrades. These stray fairy locations have been changed up from the original game, so if you think you know where all fairies are going in, you'll likely be hunting a little harder. Some exits put you into areas closer to where you need to go, eliminating running time. For example, after collecting beans underground, I was dumped outside a platform I needed rather than the front of the temple, eliminating a minute of wandering. But by far the best changes to Majora's Mask are the more detailed and comprehensive Bomber's Notebooks. These notebooks serve as your quest log, helping you keep track of where you should go and what you should be on the lookout for. The original Majora's Mask Notebooks were a little more cryptic and made you sweat out finding solutions a little more. Now, for the 3DS version, literally everything you need to know is there with a button press. The Notebooks keep track of rumors you hear from NPCs and gently suggest where you need to be to complete a task. Successful and failed tasks are also recorded, so if you mess something up on day three, you can rewind to day one and keep better track of how to fix it. These tiny tweaks make the game friendly in small doses. By giving players quick, efficient ways to tackle one sidequest or a mini-dungeon, they've ensured that they'll be comfortable playing the game in short bursts. Lunch breaks and morning commutes can now safely yield a fully completed Majora's Mask task. The new Notebooks also keep track of the specific day and time that certain events occur and let you set alarms for them, so wherever you are in Termina, you'll know when you need to be back in Clocktown to catch a ghost or some extra cash. This is an amazing addition that makes housekeeping more manageable and lets you keep track of what items you get and when without having to take written notes yourself. Games with Majora's kind of time-management mechanics would do well to steal this gem of an idea. In Majora's Mask, you have a set number of spaces to equip items and masks, and you're always swapping them around. Having the 3DS bottom screen show your gear and items at all times is an indispensable addition. You can fluidly explode a wall, attract a stray fairy, and then turn into a Deku Scrub and jump into a flower in a hot moment. It's convenient in every way that the original version was tedious. So many different items are needed at any given time, and having them all a tap away saves frustration and, more importantly, in-game time. Majora's Mask 3D runs just fine on older 3DS models, but the experience is much more improved and cozy on the latest version, the New Nintendo 3DS. The additional tiny C-stick on the right side allows you to change the camera angle at will. This helps the most in boss fights, where both you and the boss are in constant motion, and it's often hard to keep track of where you both are. It also makes navigating large spaces while riding Epona much easier. In one quest, I had to ride around a wide expanse of farmland shooting aliens, and being able to shift where I was looking while riding at breakneck speed made fending them off a breeze. If you're playing on the old 3DS, you have to lock Link in place and look around with the circle pad or use the gyroscope feature, which can get clunky. It's also frustrating for tasks that require you to move and look around quickly. Boss fights become equally annoying because lock-on targeting becomes the only way to keep tabs on the opposing monster. So while you can use your older 3DS with Majora's Mask 3D, I would highly recommend giving it a go on the newest handheld model. The overall package for Majora's Mask 3D preserves all the weird delight of the original game while lowering the barrier of entry for new players. There's still a lot that's challenging about the puzzles and fights, but a few minor tweaks make your hard-won heart containers and masks feel that much more satisfying. The changes to how you can control and manage time mean the otherwise dense Majora's Mask is comfortable for shorter play sessions, making it a great fit for the handheld. It's evident that Nintendo put a lot of thought into updating this classic, which takes the game beyond a simple remake to become a new-old classic."
1272,FIFA 17,9.0,2,"Maybe that's why FIFA 17, a football game that checks all the usual boxes you’d expect of an already successful annual sports title--trimming, tidying, domination by iteration--also throws in a more glamorous and unexpected addition: The Journey.The Journey is a new story-based mode centering on Alex Hunter, a young player breaking into professional football. It’s built from a mix of gameplay, dialogue, and cutscenes, which depict Alex’s evolving relationships with his family and teammates and, ultimately, whether his talent is enough to kickstart a dream career.It is, in other words, a football Cinderella story--and, as such, it marks a pleasant change from the relentless capitalism of FIFA’s monstrously successful Ultimate Team. FIFA already contains at least three modes life-consuming enough to take up 12 months of your spare time, and aside from an annual release schedule that demands a constant supply of newness, recapturing some of the hope and romance of football seems the only logical reason for The Journey to exist.As for the mode itself, hope and romance are what it does best--convincing dramatics and RPG gameplay, not so much. Choice within The Journey is, in practice, pretty limited, outside of the initial opportunity to choose which Premier League side Hunter joins. Certain fixed plot points underpin the story. They happen no matter how you’re performing on the pitch or behaving off it--things like being sent out on loan, or Hunter’s childhood friend and teammate Gareth Walker being inexplicably awful to him the whole time.Once you start leveling up, you can directly apply upgrade points to specific skills, enabling you to make Hunter exactly the sort of player you'd like him to be. But there's less flexibility in the dialogue choices offered during certain cutscenes and post-match interviews. These are clearly labeled--""fiery,"" ""cool,"" ""balanced""--and rather than leading individually to different opportunities or outcomes, these decisions are aggregated into a binary temperament gauge showing whether Hunter is hot-headed or sensible. This, in turn, has an effect on cosmetic things like how pleased your manager is with you or how many fans you have, but it doesn’t unlock any significant changes in events.While lead actor Adetomiwa Edun (Merlin, Bates Motel) shines through the performance capture process to offer a vulnerable, determined Alex Hunter, The Journey still sounds the occasional awkward dramatic note. Interactions between characters can seem forced, like Alex’s dad storming away from an early game or your rivalry with Gareth. And sometimes the locations themselves (especially exteriors) are quiet and empty, giving the scenes an unreal, disconnected feel.Speaking of unrealistic, sometimes the cost of mistakes seems unfeasibly high. At one point, Hunter was established in the first team at Tottenham Hotspur, and a red card led directly to him getting released from his contract despite the fact that he'd scored in the previous three games (requiring a return to the latest save). A talking-to or even a transfer listing might’ve worked here; to suggest a player scoring goals in the Premier League could find his contract canceled and career over because of a sending-off is bizarre.And yet, for all that, The Journey captures something that the existing parts of FIFA never have. Despite its rough edges, there are moments here that deliver a kind of brute emotional force: the opening scene of Sunday morning boys’ football, which puts the cliched tale in a delicate context; a pitch-side camera’s view of Hunter’s first goal for the senior side, with his own delirious shout audible above the crowd; various quiet moments of triumph and failure with family. It lacks sophistication, but The Journey has something, and it succeeds in attaching an added emotional weight to your actions on the pitch.It lacks sophistication, but The Journey has something, and it succeeds in attaching an added emotional weight to your actions on the pitch.As for the rest of this year's update, FIFA 17 feels like a round of unglamorous but welcome housekeeping after the relatively thorough gameplay changes of last year. EA has touted the switch to the Frostbite engine, a change that will presumably pay off increasingly in future years. Right now, wide shots of stadiums look very pretty, especially at night and with mist hanging in the air. But elsewhere, you'd be hard pressed to spot the difference, and some locations in The Journey--offices, bedrooms, changing rooms--look a little flat and characterless.The gameplay improvements this year are typified by much-needed tweaks but also feel like the kind of changes you only get around to when there's nothing really pressing to address. So now throw-ins can be dummied much like a faked shot, giving players a way to move defenders around and get a better chance of keeping possession. Free kicks and penalties have been freed up, so you can choose your angle of approach and charge your cross or shot much more like you would in regular play.Physical play, too, has been refined so that holding the left trigger down is now the way to let the game know, in attack or defense, that you want your players to engage physically with the other team. It's a small tweak, but it’s one that removes some of the mystery surrounding jostling while defending and seems very useful for holding on to the ball while in possession, especially with sturdy midfielders like Mousa Dembele or Paul Pogba. Finally, the inclusion of low, driven shots adds an appreciable new wrinkle to offensive play. Nail the timing, and you're able to power efforts on goal low and accurately, finally ending the years-long, reality-defying rule that more power must equal more height.Other welcome-but-non-revolutionary additions include multiplayer skill games--things like passing drills and small matches of two-on-two--which are so much fun that the loading screens for full matches now threaten to become the matches themselves. There’s also the fact that reality--or a small slice of it, at least--has been invited into Career mode. Your objectives in managing a club are now more specifically tailored to the club in question, and are divided into Domestic and Continental success, Brand Value, Finance, and Youth Development. Pick Tottenham, for example, and your club overlords will be less worried about European success than winning at home. Choose Manchester United, and you'll not only have high expectations in terms of winning trophies but also a global brand to sustain. It's a relatively simple way of removing the mode's previous one-size-fits-all feel while giving a sense of individuality to every playthrough. There's now a reason other than boredom to switch clubs or start a new career altogether.This year's FIFA, then, can be fairly summarized as one big change that doesn't quite pay off, and lots of small ones that do.Ultimate Team remains FIFA’s biggest draw, with EA choosing to add to rather than tinker with a winning formula. The most notable addition are Squad Building Challenges, which require players to construct sides with certain conditions--using only players of two different nationalities, or with a minimum chemistry level--and then submit them for rewards. It’s a very smart piece of design, not only giving players a use for the scores of bronze and silver players they’ll accrue over the course of a season (and that will never feature in a playing squad), but also making play of the subtle and sophisticated problem-solving that already underpins Ultimate Team’s systems."
436,Ring Fit Adventure,9.0,2," Editor's note: Ring Fit Adventure first released on October 18, 2019. Because we were unable to review the game back then, we're taking this opportunity--the one-year anniversary of its release--to give it a full evaluation now. In this review, Jenae Sitzes reflects on a full year of on-and-off workouts with Nintendo Switch's premier fitness game.over 43 million copies worldwide, so it was only a matter of time before the company attempted to replicate that success on Nintendo Switch. Fortunately, Wii Fit's successor is far more ambitious than many people may have anticipated. Released one year ago on October 18, 2019, Ring Fit Adventure is not Wii Fit 2.0, but rather a full-blown fitness RPG with an overarching story, skill tree, and vibrant, lively landscapes. Not only is it far more ambitious in terms of scope than its predecessor, but it also fosters a healthier attitude toward fitness and a friendly tone that's relentlessly encouraging without a hint of judgment, even when it's been weeks--or even months--since you last logged in.In Ring Fit Adventure, you team up with a magical pilates ring to track down and defeat an evil bodybuilding dragon named Dragaux, who is spreading a dark influence across the land. In your pursuit of Dragaux, you jog through beautiful landscapes and engage in turn-based battles against fitness-themed monsters (such as a feisty dumbbell or mischievous yoga mat). In order to attack or defend, you'll have to perform exercises, and the game eventually introduces type matchups--some monsters will be particularly weak to leg moves, for instance. With four different move types available (leg, arm, abs, and yoga), Ring Fit Adventure provides a great full-body workout, and even though some levels may focus on one muscle group over the other, the option to use different move types keeps workouts balanced and prevents you from tiring out too quickly.Type matchups are only one aspect of combat strategy in Ring Fit Adventure, however. Food items play a key role as well, from smoothies that regenerate your health and revive you to soups and teas that provide certain buffs, like boosting the attack of all arm moves or converting your move type to yoga. If you get into a battle you're not prepared for type-wise, these items can literally save you. Outside of combat, there's even a skill tree where you can unlock new moves and increase your stats, and every world has a shop where you can buy new apparel to boost your attack or defense as well as ingredients to cook more food for your battles. In this way, every aspect of Ring Fit Adventure feeds into making you stronger and giving you more tools to use in battle beyond simply equipping enough arm moves or leg moves. Ring Fit's embrace of its RPG elements keeps progression varied and interesting over months of playing the game, and you'll continue to unlock new moves, recipes, and abilities late into the game--it never gets stagnant. This makes the gameplay much more engaging than just following along to moves on a screen, and especially in boss fights, having the right items available and the best moves equipped can mean the difference between success and a KO. The fact that you can actually lose a fight (rather than simply being scored, like in other fitness games) is particularly motivating, engaging you both physically and mentally to give each battle your all.At the center of Ring Fit's combat is the Ring-Con, a real-life pilates ring that connects to one of your Joy-Cons (while the other slips into a leg strap to go around your thigh). The Ring-Con is remarkably sturdy and has held up well over the past year, with no noticeable change in its resistance or durability. That's impressive considering how much you pull and squeeze the Ring-Con throughout the game's lengthy campaign. Whether you're pressing it against your stomach for an Ab Guard or lifting it overhead for a tree pose, the Ring-Con is at the center of nearly every move, tracking your precise movements. As in other Nintendo exercise games like Fitness Boxing, I've found that you really can't half-ass these exercises. In Ring Fit, ignoring proper form means your attacks will do less damage, and if it's a defensive move, you risk taking a devastating hit. This not only keeps the stakes high in-game; it also makes sure you're getting the most out of your workout and helps prevent injury. Some of these moves can be tricky to get right, but in-game, you have your trusty Ring giving advice on how to do each move correctly with plenty of encouragement.Ring Fit Adventure encourages you to listen to your body, to understand its needs and to not push yourself beyond your limits.Ring Fit Adventure has an unwavering cheerfulness to it, and while that's certainly true of many first-party Nintendo games, it has a deeper impact in the context of a workout game. It's so easy to get down on yourself when you miss a workout or two, and as someone with severe anxiety, sometimes I just can't muster the will to do anything at all, let alone get strapped up for a Ring Fit session. There can be such a negative energy around exercise and the expectations to be consistent or look a certain way, but Ring Fit Adventure throws that all out the window. It goes out of its way to make you feel welcome and accepted, no matter what fitness level you're at or how long it's been since your last workout. When you boot up the game, it simply asks you if you're feeling sore at all from the last session and if you want to adjust the difficulty at all. Rather than urging you to keep hiking up the difficulty, the game simply accepts your answer and even asks if it's annoying to keep asking. Don't want to stretch with Tipp, your friendly in-game trainer, today? No problem--the game simply takes you back to where you were in the campaign. The removal of pressure to do certain activities or make gameplay harder lets you improve at your own pace and prevents exercise from taking on a negative connotation as it so easily can in the real world.There's also a convenient ""quiet mode"" option for those who either prefer not to or physically can't jog in place. Aimed at those who may have neighbors living beneath them or need to keep noise minimal for some other reason, quiet mode allows you to do a series of squats rather than jogging in place as your character dashes through Ring Fit's worlds. Not only is this feature helpful for not bothering others, it also lends to the game's accessibility, as jogging is a high-impact exercise that may not be possible for everyone, including those with lower-body injuries. The ability to decrease the game's difficulty setting at any time and select exactly which exercises you want to do also allows you to customize your workout to suit your needs.Still, I'll admit there's a level of forgiveness in the game that could be counterproductive to growth if you lack the motivation--and perhaps it's part of why I've only played around 35 hours over the past year. Ring Fit Adventure encourages remarkably short sessions, prompting you to ""take a break"" and cool down so you're ready to go again tomorrow. Sometimes, I'll exercise for only 10 minutes or so before getting this message reminding me not to overwork myself. It's in line with Ring Fit's cheery, positive tone, but this is a fitness game, after all, and experts recommend that the average adult gets at least 30 minutes of physical activity a day. Unless you decide to ignore Ring Fit's prompts and keep playing, the game is happy to let you cool down after completing just one world or two and go about your merry way. As someone who picked up Ring Fit to challenge myself and improve my fitness, this messaging has definitely influenced me to have shorter sessions and, as a result, not progress as much as I may have otherwise over the past 12 months.These prompts to take a break and not overdo it play into what Ring Fit Adventure is trying to say about health and fitness overall, though, and that's a much bigger part of what makes it not only a great fitness game, but also an important successor to Wii Fit. Gone is the problematic BMI metric, which isn't an accurate measure of health or body fat percentage and can have detrimental effects on body image. Also gone is the emphasis on how much weight you want to lose and how many calories you've burned. Instead, Ring Fit Adventure encourages you to listen to your body, to understand its needs and to not push yourself beyond your limits. It doesn't just provide a good--and entertaining--workout; it fosters a healthy attitude toward fitness, nutrition, and overall well-being. For example, there's no mention of calories around food; instead, food items help you grow stronger and literally revitalize you. Daily tips at the end of every session remind you to get plenty of sleep and to avoid training when your body feels bad. Meanwhile, Dragaux, the epitome of toxic workout culture, represents the dangers of focusing solely on your gains and constantly competing with others instead of focusing on your individual health and needs. By rejecting fitness as a goal in itself and instead embracing personal health and growth, Ring Fit Adventure provides a much more achievable and fulfilling experience.The best part is that there's just so much of it, too. Ring Fit has 23 main worlds and an extensive post-game that takes you through the previous worlds with new dialogue and harder levels. It also comes with minigames that you can play freely outside of the campaign along with custom workouts that let you focus on specific moves you want to master or muscle groups you want to work on. A free rhythm mode was added earlier this year, though I found it disappointing--the song selection is lacking and the movements themselves, which involve pushing and stretching the Ring-Con at different angles, feel awkward and not fun. Still, there's plenty to keep you busy with Ring Fit long after you finish the main story, and even doing that will take you some time--I haven't beaten the game yet myself after one year (though it obviously depends on how often you play and the length of your sessions).By rejecting fitness as a goal in itself and instead embracing personal health and growth, Ring Fit Adventure provides a much more achievable and fulfilling experience.Like many people, I've relied on Ring Fit Adventure as my only method of getting any exercise for most of the COVID-19 pandemic so far. After sitting inside my tiny apartment day after day, moving from bed to chair to couch, I was always grateful to be able to pick up my Ring-Con and go jogging through Ring Fit's luscious, vibrant landscapes. Though there's no straying from the preset path in each area and many of the worlds do look quite similar, they still feel great to jog through. As someone who grew up running and prefers it as a form of exercise, I will say that cardio feels minimal in Ring Fit Adventure compared to strength training. Outside of these short jogs in between battles, there aren't many activities aimed at getting your heart rate up, which is why Ring Fit Adventure probably shouldn't be your only source of physical activity. It offers a fantastic workout and supplement to any gym routine, but it can't beat going for a real run or long swim or bike ride. I bought a fold-up apartment treadmill a couple of months ago, and it's been great to switch between Ring Fit and the treadmill on different days to feel like I'm getting enough cardio along with working my muscles.Ring Fit Adventure builds on the legacy of Wii Fit in important ways, not only pushing the limits of what a workout game can be but also repositioning its message around fitness in a much healthier and constructive way. Fitness isn't a steady, consistent journey for most people; it's full of tiny improvements and setbacks and obstacles that get in your way, much like one's progress in an RPG. Because of this, Ring Fit Adventure works perfectly both as a concept and in practice. The sheer volume of content along with new abilities, items, and difficulty levels keeps progression interesting through the entire campaign and beyond. With consistently engaging gameplay, gorgeous landscapes, and a relentlessly positive attitude, Ring Fit Adventure has set a new standard for fitness games, and I look forward to another year of growing stronger with it--and eventually beating that absurdly buff dragon."
2361,Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch,9.0,2,"       Thus begins your journey alongside a heartbroken young boy desperate to restore order to his life and his world. Oliver is the soul of the adventure--and his companion Drippy is the wit. Drippy is hardly mere comic relief, but his enthusiasm is infectious. He frequently refers to himself as High Lord of the Fairies in a delightful Welsh accent, egging Oliver on during moments of uncertainty. It's in Ni no Kuni's most surreal scenarios that Drippy's dialogue tickles the most--places where lines like ""These littlies are nowhere near as fragile as they are egg-looking!"" make a silly sort of sense. His follow-up line: ""When I was their age, I ate squid for breakfast! Proper hard I was!"" Drippy's a wonderful sidekick (though Drippy sees you as his sidekick, to be fair), and remains a joy, even 60 or more hours in.         The result is a world you love to be in, which is just as well: even as the game seems to wrap up its story with an emotionally satisfying conclusion, it presses forward, refusing to let plot threads dangle, and uprooting any sense of complacency. The whimsy of the writing is matched by the whimsy of the world and the situations you encounter. This is a game in which you explore the pastel-colored innards of a giant wobbling mother before she fancifully erupts and you experience a second birth of sorts. Unusual? Yes--but also utterly enchanting. Even the smallest moments deliver glee. A llama with a gourmet appetite wants yummies. A traveler keeps misplacing his diary. A wannabe diva of a molten monster warbles a few notes that could break a champagne glass. This is a world of wild imagination, and so you pursue every side quest and peek into every nook, knowing that a surprise lies in wait.                   Familiars level separately from their handlers, so the majority of battles end with a pronouncement that at least one pet or another has gained a level. (Fortunately, your 9 active pets gain experience even if you don't order them into combat.) The constant notifications give you a great sense of progress, which is important given the amount of grinding needed to keep a decent number of creatures ready for battle. Newly-captured familiars are weaklings, and it takes time to get them in tip-top shape. And even after spending significant time with them, some familiars just aren't that effective, rarely (if ever) getting used because there are battle-ready creatures that you've already leveled up.  As a result, you'll probably have a number of reliable pets you keep with you at all times, and will switch out a few other slots here and there to take advantage of particular magical skills--or just for the thrill of seeing a new pet in action.      The possibility of bringing along an ineffective familiar might lead to frustration if you aren't careful (and sometimes, even if you are). There are some notable difficulty spikes which are compounded by potentially imbalanced parties. Yet even at its most challenging, it's hard not to appreciate the grotesqueries you face, and the possibility of getting to nab one for yourself. You won't add boss creatures to your pen, but that hardly makes the boss battles less rewarding. Bosses require the most party micromanagement, and are often a wonder to look at to boot. Among them are a slithering snake in Egyptian garb, hissing at you with its menacing purple tongue; a horned demon, its obese figure belted by gnarled branches; and a rubbery invertebrate with blinking lights rimming its bell and tentacles, giving it the look of a carnival ride.        "
1844,Alien: Isolation,6.0,1,"   it's on. You are Ellen Ripley's daughter Amanda, seeking information about your mother's fate aboard the Sevastopol, a derelict space station home to a remaining population of skittish survivors and a snarling, salivating xenomorph drone. The game reaches its zenith within levels structured as a game of cat-and-mouse, casting you, of course, in the role of the underpowered mouse. You crouch, slink, and peek around corners and above crates from a first-person perspective, avoiding the sideways glances of the fearsome creature that gives the franchise its name. When all mechanics are working as intended, alien-evasion is dread distilled into its purest form. You are equipped with a couple of standard firearms and a few helpful gadgets, such as noisemakers for distracting the beast, and a flamethrower that acts as a temporary safeguard in later levels, but the motion tracker is the most vital tool you possess. Hold a button, and the tracker's dot shows you the relative location of nearby entities, friends and foes alike. The tracker does not tell you, however, if the alien is above or below you, scurrying through the ventilation ducts. If your sound system is lacking, you should don a good pair of headphones if you desire precise situational awareness. Hearing the xeno's clawed feet can paralyze you with fear, and you must battle your basic fight-or-flight instincts when you hear the alien's shuddering exoskeleton. To fight is to perish; to flee is to directly gift your flesh to the pursuer. Actually, running might save you if there's a locker close enough to hide in, though your best bet is to stay crouched, stay hidden, and stay aware. These are the moments when Alien: Isolation weighs heaviest on your soul. Within said locker, you see the alien enter the room. It sidles up to your hiding place, and you hold your breath--in real life, and in the game. If the xeno hears your gasps, or if you fail to lean into the rear of the locker, it snatches you from your shelter and you peer into its two gaping maws before succumbing to death. Weirdly, holding your breath causes your health to deplete after a few seconds, so if you're nearing death when the alien comes calling, it might nab you even if you follow the game's instructions to the letter. The mechanic is strange: not only does it not make sense that you lose health when holding your breath for a few scant seconds, it doesn't make sense that the alien would be the cause of death. The game never informs you of the possibility, so should it occur, you might assume the game doesn't abide by its own rules. After all, no amount of logic would lead you to believe that the alien grabbed you because you ran out of health while holding your breath. Nevertheless, I can't deny the appeal of dodging the murderous menace. There were moments in which I was Ripley, impulsively sprinting away from the xenomorph when I heard it fall to the floor from a vent just behind me, and crying out when its barbed tail plunged into me from behind and emerged from my torso. I would peer from around corners to see it scanning the area just 20 feet from me, and follow quietly behind it as it slithered down the hallway. But these moments, these game-defining high points, account for only a few chapters out of many, and Alien: Isolation doesn't even make the most out of them. At one point via radio, your comrade encourages you to rush, the game thus prompting you to run towards your destination. And over the next few minutes, you confront several of Alien: Isolation's annoyances, compacted into one bite-sized space for your displeasure. When all mechanics are working as intended, alien-evasion is dread distilled into its purest, simplest form. There's the issue of the command to hurry, for instance, because following the game's lead means you will quickly die. You see, the xenomorph now waits for you to cross under a vent opening from which it can attack--a mechanic that the game introduces when you are under duress. (As it happens, though, there is no actual reason to hurry; the level gives you all the time you need, even though the game itself has insisted you rush.) Your motion tracker is little help here; your cue to the alien's presence is the cascade of saliva and goo dripping from the ceiling's openings. This is a neat idea, but the mechanic's sudden appearance isn't foreshadowed, making your first death at its hands one of Alien's multiple ""what just happened?"" events. The game is fond of introducing new rules in this fashion, leading to head-scratching trial and error and the occasional pounding of fist upon desk when you realize the game's limited save system is making you repeat the last 15 minutes of slow, careful sneaking. Bear in mind, however, that alien encounters are limited to just a few levels. Typically, you're walking, pulling levers, riding elevators, and walking some more. This is the downtime, the time for building atmosphere, and Alien: Isolation wisely embraces that 1970s retro-futuristic style that characterized Alien, with its monochrome computer monitors and its cathode-ray technology--the kind of datedness Douglas Adams called ""zeerust."" Perhaps it's fitting that the game itself looks rather dated, its character models in particular, whose elbows look as though they could cut glass when they bend, and whose blank faces are always covered with a bizarre sheen of sweat. The visual weaknesses would be easier to overlook had they not interfered with the game's attempts to build tension, but having the alien's head clip into the locker you're hiding in dispels any anxiety the scene has established. The alien itself looks fantastic, at least; death may prove frustrating, but it's the best way of admiring the xeno's two sets of razor-sharp teeth. The exploration ultimately falls flat, a victim to backtracking and simplistic gameplay elements lacking in creativity. Many video games feature security cameras that alert the enemy to your presence--but in Alien: Isolation, the camera off-switch is often located directly beneath the camera. Sometimes, you must log into computer terminals to find codes that unlock important doors--but the email with the code might be on the same terminal that does the unlocking. The rewiring stations that allow you to disable cameras may also allow you to manipulate the Sevastopol's air-purification mechanism and other systems, but rarely to any meaningful end. The cameras, the rewiring stations, the codes--it's as if they are here because that's just what video games do. Even the story beats fall victim to by-the-numbers claptrap: the game leads you from one section to the next, always making it clear which characters exist to serve as alien fodder, and predictably mirroring the original film's themes and plot. Androids serve as your most frequent foe in Alien: Isolation, and they're common enough that it's tempting to bash them straight-on with a stun baton. A typical synthetic turncoat won't take too kindly to a direct attack, however, and will aggressively fling you at a nearby wall, if not outright whack you. The first-person perspective makes becoming a synthetic's personal yo-yo frighteningly disorienting, another notch in the game's favor. Here, again, I feel as Ripley does: helpless and afraid as I desperately scan the environment, seeking a clear path through impending danger. Some gadgets prove mostly useless when dealing with synthetics; they seem wholly unfazed by flashbang grenades, for instance, making a shotgun blast to the head the most appealing option when there's nowhere to run. This is four hours' worth of a great idea stretched into 14-plus hours of messy stealth gameplay, creaky video game cliches, and limp exploration. Other synthetic encounters are simply ridiculous, however. A dozen-plus hours in, you ride an open-air elevator downward, taking in one of Alien: Isolation's most striking views, one that intimates that the game's finale could be at last drawing near. A synthetic is waiting for you at the bottom, and there is no mechanic in place allowing you to veil your presence from him, or his three robotic friends that follow. A number of cover locations just beyond tell you that stealth was meant to be an option, but the manner in which the keen-eyed synthetics are spaced, the nature of a lift ride that deposits you into danger, and the narrowness of the walkways you traverse make for a cluster of madness. To deal with synthetics is often to engage in a silly game of tag, in which you lead a few androids around in circles until you buy yourself enough time to turn and toss a molotov cocktail at them. That elevator ride signals the moment the hopes for Alien: Isolation shatter--the moment it tries and and mostly fails to mimic a more straightforward action game on its way to a frustrating conclusion. At least the ending brings with it a sense of relief. Some of this relief stems from the lingering fear of the alien's presence. You have left the game and its creature behind, never to smell the alien's putrid breath, never to witness its syrupy saliva, never to seek refuge in a claustrophobic locker and wish the beast away. More relieving is that you won't have to trudge through the same duct-lined corridors for another however-many hours, or have to repeat ten minutes of switch-pulling and keycard-searching after firing a bullet into a friendly's head because you presumed she might attack you, as so many dwellers do. Alien: Isolation provides us a glimpse into a future that holds the Alien game you've always wanted. It is not, however, the vessel that carries you there."
1226,Hitman,7.0,2,"Do you infiltrate and choke your target with a wire, or drop poison into their favorite cocktail? These are two of many possible tactics that you can employ. There's nothing stopping you from opening fire in a crowd either if that's what you want. Just be sure to have a solid exit strategy when your enemies retaliate.Incapacitating hapless NPCs and stealing their clothes to disguise yourself is a major component of Hitman's design, and each mission gives you numerous options to consider. One disguise can only get you so far, so you frequently need to change your outfit, depending on your path and strategy. Each environment is open, with very few choke-points, and you're free to mix up your methods to suit your preferred style of play. But you won't get far unless you keep changing outfits. The reliance on disguises feels stifling at times, but this is alleviated somewhat by the myriad other options that are available once you dig deeper into a location.Each of the three maps--a party boat, a modest military aircraft hanger, and the aforementioned Parisian mansion--feature distinct, over-the-top hit opportunities that lend a unique flavor to each mission. Tampering with a fighter jet so your target falls prey to a malfunctioning ejection seat is more rewarding than, say, simply shooting them or snapping their neck. I also took great joy in masquerading as a fashion model to gain unprecedented access to another target; I infiltrated a social group and fooled hundreds of onlookers at once.The fashion show is where Hitman shines, and it's an impressive display of how complex and varied one location can be. There are gardens to sneak through, a wine cellar to search for clues, a jam-packed crowd in front of a catwalk to hide your face, not to mention the expansive collection of rooms and hallways. It's almost impossible to account for the plethora of ways you can hit your marks here, and even though you may have seen it all, you probably haven't done it all. It's a multi-part mission that allows you to meander and experiment for hours on end, and a perfect illustration of how nuanced you can be in an isolated yet ornate environment.More than objects or NPCs, it's Hitman's UI settings that hold the most power over your experience. Though you can take advantage of systems--the likes of which allow Agent 47 to see through walls--that can make your job easier, you may also choose to disable all assist options and immerse yourself in the challenge at hand. In a sea of hundreds, surrounded by potential threats, Agent 47's missions can be daunting assignments that test your ability to improvise under smothering scrutiny.Agent 47's missions can be daunting assignments that test your ability to improvise under smothering scrutiny.Once you complete your first run through Hitman's three missions, your job isn't finished; escalation missions appear, introducing new objectives with constraints that dictate new targets, what equipment you have to use, and even what type of disguise you have to wear during a kill. You can also create your own contracts, with full control over the aforementioned conditions and objectives. You simply need to enter a location, mark targets, take them out and successfully escape.There's no denying that repeatedly revisiting the same locations wears on your enthusiasm, but escalation missions and contracts stave this feeling off for a while with prescribed, alternative objectives. Because Hitman is episodic at the moment, you don't have the chance to move through a campaign and distance yourself from a mission. Of course, there's a lot to do if you're looking for new opportunities, but after your first run through a mission, the initial feeling of immersion fades as you transition into full-on puzzle-solving mode.As you poke and prod at Hitman, looking for new ways to complete missions and take advantage of your options in a given environment, you also start to notice gaps in logic that allow you to circumvent AI. Reaching from behind an enemy to grab something on a table in front of them won't necessarily get their attention; as long as you're close enough to trigger a button prompt without passing through their field of view, you're in the clear. You can also act like a total oddball, bumping into targets or crouching suspiciously near them without triggering concern. Hitman presents itself as a stealth game that can be as hardcore as you want it to be, but its AI fails to connect all the dots on a semi-regular basis. Should I be able to exit a mission after gunning down people in a packed party? You wouldn't think so, but somehow the guards manning the exit don't always get the memo when there's a madman on the loose. You can choose to ignore these moments or use them to your advantage, but you can't dismiss how they detract from Hitman's proposed tension.Hitman feels at odds with itself on occasion, but there's no question that missions are the star of the show, not the story.Then again, Hitman is sometimes designed to make you laugh. As you go about your business on a mission, non-threatening NPCs comment on your seemingly benign but strange behavior. They whine about their jobs when you engage with them in disguise. There's a definite contrast between Hitman's gameplay and its story, which is doled out in mysterious cutscenes that feature stone-cold antagonists. Hitman feels at odds with itself on occasion, but there's no question that missions are the star of the show, not the story.Hitman's opening act isn't ground-breaking, with a host of tiny problems lending it a dated feel. When you drop a body into a freezer, there's no animation connecting the process together; there's a hard cut from dragging the body to hiding it. Load times are frustratingly long, lasting just under a full minute when reloading saves. This alone is especially disappointing, given how fun it can be to iterate on your methods by reloading saves and experimenting, a process that's tainted by extended downtime. However, Hitman's a veritable playground that will delight you with its open-ended design, comical NPCs, and contract creation tools. These qualities, and the flexibility to be as hardcore or laid back as you want, are much appreciated, even if they don't disguise Hitman's lesser qualities."
1061,Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of DANA,8.0,2,"Ys VIII begins with longtime hero Adol and his friend Dogi on a huge passenger ship when, out of nowhere, the vessel is attacked by a gargantuan sea monster and destroyed. Adol wakes up to find himself on the mythical island of Seiren, a supposedly cursed land from which no person has ever returned. He soon bands together with a few other survivors of the wreck, and decides to help them explore the island to rescue other passengers and build a makeshift community while figuring out a means to escape. All the while, however, the ancient beasts that live on the island are not pleased with the human intrusion, and a deeper secret behind the island’s curse lies waiting to be uncovered.Finding survivors and building a village on a deserted island is a pretty unique concept for an action-RPG, and the story does a good job of driving you to explore the island to seek out others. The eclectic cast of characters who come to live in the island village make for an interesting mix of talents and personalities, and it’s very satisfying to watch the capabilities of your island base grow as more people join and you help them out through questing. Ys VIII conveys camaraderie through hardship, making you feel happy when the village accomplishes a new milestone, sad when tragedy strikes, and fearful when a new threat emerges.But even if you weren’t out rescuing other shipwreck survivors, you’d likely still feel compelled to explore the beautiful landscapes of Seiren Island. Ys VIII is a gorgeous game, filled with immensely colorful landscapes, dangerous yet captivating dungeons, and plenty of unique scenery to discover. Serene ocean vistas, fascinating geological formations, immense rainbow-casting waterfalls, and mysterious plant life are among the many scenic spots you’ll encounter in your travels. You even have the option to explore some areas at either daytime or nighttime, and the latter casts some familiar locales in an entirely new light. It’s easy to get caught up in a spirit of wanderlust and meander into areas that aren’t essential to the current story, but you want to explore just because you can. The kickin’, energy-infused progressive-rock soundtrack--an Ys series staple--helps a lot in driving you to explore further as well.Of course, exploring the dangerous parts of Seiren wouldn’t be nearly as enjoyable if the core action-RPG gameplay wasn’t up to snuff. But Ys VIII delivers wonderfully in this aspect, giving players fast-paced, easy-to-learn combat with a surprising amount of depth. Chaining together basic strikes and special attacks while using your teammates’ weapons to exploit enemy weaknesses quickly becomes second nature. As you become more comfortable with fighting, you’ll learn to utilize skills like the Flash Move and Flash Guard: special dodges and blocks executed with precise timing that give you a huge advantage over the enemy. These skills come in especially handy during the game’s boss encounters, which have you battling against some truly strange and unusual island creatures. The smooth flow of fighting and ease of play makes the combat one of Ys VIII’s high points. Perhaps the only knock against the battle system is that the default controls are a little odd--but, thankfully, the combat controls are completely remappable to your liking.From action to exploration, Ys VIII has a lot going for it--which, unfortunately, makes the times when it stumbles more obvious. The pacing is inconsistent, sometimes interrupting exploration for long stretches of plot development--and, occasionally, swapping the protagonist of the game entirely for extended stretches of story. The game also has an annoying tendency to deliver “interception” missions while you’re knee-deep in dungeon crawling, asking you to go back to town and play an annoying tower-defense style minigame where you guard the village against waves of monsters. While most interception missions are optional, you’ll feel compelled to do them anyway; they yield very useful rewards and raise the approval of Adol among the commune’s residents, which becomes key in the endgame.The English localization also leaves a lot to be desired. While it’s certainly not the worst translation I’ve ever seen, it feels like a tremendous missed opportunity. Dialogue is often dry and uninteresting, or awkwardly stilted, robbing characters and story moments of some of their impact. With such a ragtag bunch of interesting castaways on display, it feels like these characters should have a lot more personality in their speech. Ys VIII’s localization also makes some very odd choices with terminology and phrasing, leading to strange moments like a companion shouting “somebody’s here!” in areas where the only things around are trees, rocks, and bloodthirsty monsters.But even when it falters, it’s hard to hate Ys VIII for long. The feel of fighting your way through a big, beautiful island of untamed wilderness to save a group of people brought together by circumstance while uncovering an ancient mystery is an absolute delight, and will compel you to keep exploring for hours on end. Whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer to the exploits of Adol Christin, you’ll find a lot to enjoy in the exotic world of Ys VIII."
1111,The Walking Dead: The Telltale Series - A New Frontier,6.0,1,"From the Gallows stumbles to its conclusion much like the walkers that finally appear in this concluding episode of Telltale Games' A New Frontier. While this closing act ties all the dangling plotlines into a neat bow, the fiery promise of its predecessors sputters out due to some odd dramatic choices. Everything plays out too predictably and is too indulgent of Walking Dead franchise cliches to be particularly satisfying to those who have followed the travails of Javi Garcia and his erstwhile flame (and sister-in-law) Kate since Episode One arrived just before last Christmas.Of course, it's hard to properly critique From the Gallows without delving into the narrative that unfolds in this episode. The story picks up precisely where the last episode, Thicker Than Water, concluded. The fortress town of Richmond has just exploded into civil war with a gunfight on the streets. Kate has accidentally plowed a stolen truck into a wall, allowing a herd of zombies into the heart of the city--and apparently killing herself in the resulting explosion. In short, everything has gone completely to hell.Or has it? Kate is soon seen none the worse for wear, despite riding an exploding truck into a wall that's soon overrun by zombies. The wild gun battle abruptly ends as everyone runs away from the incoming walkers. Walking Dead and general action-movie cliches come fast and furiously. Your core group of survivors flee across rooftops in scenes that evoke moments from earlier Telltale seasons, as well as those from early episodes of the TV series. Javi uses zombie guts as camouflage to walk between zombies. The guy you think is going to die does die, almost immediately after a dialogue sequence that concludes any unfinished business hanging over the plot from the last episode. He might as well be wearing a red shirt and beaming down to a planet with Captain Kirk.Disappointingly, the big showdown between Javi and David is a huge letdown. These two hate each other, and they're both in love with the same woman, so you expect fireworks. Instead, you get pretty much nothing. Even after it's fully revealed that Kate is in love with Javi and wants nothing to do with her hothead hubby, the brothers do nothing more than get into a brawl that's capped by David taking off in a truck with his son Gabe. You can't help but be disappointed, especially if you take the high road and refuse to fight back, honoring the wishes expressed by your father in the opening prologue.Even worse, David dies offscreen. The truck gets overwhelmed by zombies. David gets bitten. Gabe has to finish off his dad. All of this is recounted to you via a dialogue scene when Gabe returns--which, of course, ruins any sense of closure to the story between Javi and David that's been the underpinning of this entire season. It's all wrapped up by an oddly cold denouement. Javi and Kate go to David's body, she pulls off his Army dog tags, and then buries them without a word of eulogy. She even leaves her wedding ring on the dirt. David was a complete jerk through all of A New Frontier, to the point that you were clearly meant to root for Javi and Kate to get together, but this ending comes off cold to the point of being cruel. For the first time in the season, it's hard not to feel sorry for the guy.This whole sequence may well change depending on a choice you make to either stay with Kate when she goes to help Richmond or go off in pursuit of David and Gabe--or if you chose earlier on to avoid any sort of commitment to Kate. Multiple replays are likely needed to unveil everything. But there's no way that David should be allowed to die off-screen no matter what choices are made by the player. The feud between the brothers and the love triangle between them and Kate plays too big a part in this season for this to ever occur. And it's pretty likely to happen to most players, given how much it makes sense for you to stay with Kate at the end considering the growing relationship--and how much the natural ending of the game is for Javi and Kate to wind up together.With all that said, From the Gallows isn't entirely frustrating. The happy ending with Javi and Kate will be really satisfying to shippers rooting for them all along, especially given how few of these moments occur in the Walking Dead universe. There's a lot of action here too, mostly featuring Javi gunning down walkers. There isn't much challenge involved, but it's still nice to get more involved and to be directly threatened by a whole lot of undead for what's really the first time this season.Clementine is used reasonably well as a background character--which seems fitting, given that this isn't her story. The writers do a great job of easing her into the supporting cast so that she remains a presence, but one that doesn't overwhelm the real protagonists. The only oddity with Clem's story comes at the very end, when she heads off into the sunset to find her lost surrogate son with no survival gear besides a pistol and a knife. All this conclusion needs is the sad piano music featured at the end of old episodes of &lt;i&gt;The Incredible Hulk&lt;/i&gt;.After a strong start, A New Frontier ends on a slightly weak note with From the Gallows. This season had its high points, and it remains well worth playing, especially if you're a serious fan of the Walking Dead franchise, due to the generally superb dialogue, voice acting, and stylish comic-book visuals. But an overall lack of player interaction, too many cliches, and a lame, predictable climax that goes out with a whimper instead of a bang make the season much less memorable than it could've been."
4099,Harbinger,4.0,0,"While most action role-playing games, such as the extremely successful Diablo series, are set in a fantasy world, Harbinger attempts to stand apart from the crowd by taking on a sci-fi theme. Although the futuristic setting is a welcome change of pace, Harbinger falls short of the mark, with half-baked action and role-playing elements that are overly shallow and simplistic.   The game takes place on the titular space cruiser, in which a small band of outcasts hides away in a tiny corner of the ship. Harbinger is a slave ship, and most of its occupants are trapped aboard under the iron-fisted control of a being known only as ""the overlord."" Amidst the backdrop of a major war between the ship's primary factions, you and your band of misfits attempt to stay alive.    There are only three character classes to choose from in Harbinger: human, gladiator, and culibine. The gladiator is a cyborglike robot infused with the consciousness of a living being, while the culibine resembles Diablo's sorcerer character, though in practice, all the classes play about the same. While the different classes have special gadgets they can use--the gladiator can control remotely operated cameras and the human can drop mines of varying types, for example--these items actually don't figure prominently into the gameplay because of play-balance issues between the attack types.   All three classes have a ranged attack, and the human and gladiator have true melee attacks. When engaged in close-quarters combat, the culibine can use a spell-like ability to damage enemies in a small radius around her. However, almost all ranged attacks from enemies in Harbinger are slow projectiles that are easily dodged. You can also outrun just about all the enemies in the game. As a result, you'll find that the entire game consists of running away, firing off a couple of shots, dodging your enemies' shots, and then running some more. There is no point in putting yourself in harm's way by moving into melee range when you can avoid damage altogether by just running and shooting all the time. While you could argue that this kind of shallow gameplay is a feature of almost any other game of this kind, Harbinger lacks the fun elements that better action RPGs possess.   There are few monster types in Harbinger. In fact, for some bizarre reason, the game has about as many different types of treasure chests (in which you can find items and weapons) as it does enemies, especially if you count the same soldier carrying three or four different weapons as one unique type, and the same bug with slightly different coloring and textures as one type. Each character class has only four different attributes to choose from when it gains an experience level. Since melee combat is more or less useless, that leaves three useful attributes per character. This relative lack of traits or new skills to unlock essentially takes all the excitement out of gaining levels.   There isn't even any fun in finding new weapons and armor, because each character can use only extremely specific types of armor or weapons. Gathering money doesn't even come into play until about three-quarters of the way through the game, when the merchant finally turns over his inventory with better items. About the only thing you'll want to buy are health packs, because you can almost always find better equipment in the field.   The only depth to be found in Harbinger is the fact that different enemies are vulnerable to different types of attacks. For example, robotic opponents are weak against EMP attacks, while the buglike cimicidae are vulnerable to electricity. Once you find a weapon that can fire all four different types of attacks, you're all set for the rest of the game, and playing is just a matter of swapping different attack types into the same weapon.   Unlike Diablo, Harbinger doesn't feature randomly generated maps or any multiplayer options; it's strictly a single-player game. Although the three classes play along separate but parallel mission paths that intersect from time to time (with limited branching options), the replay value in Harbinger is extremely limited--it's unlikely that you'd want to play the game again with another class after beating the campaign once.   Graphically, Harbinger is no better than average. While it has some reasonably detailed environments, the game suffers from a lack of frames in its character animation and occasional slowdown when a lot of enemies are onscreen. There isn't a lot of music in the game aside from some background pieces to set the mood, and the sound effects are fairly basic, so even the game's production values are particularly engaging. With so many better options available, Harbinger's shallow gameplay and limited replay value make it difficult to recommend, even with its modest retail price of $30."
3198,Pokemon Black/White Version,8.0,2,"     Not messing with tradition, Pokemon Black begins with you being summoned to the lab of a local Pokemon professor, who this time is named Juniper. She asks you and your two friends--Cheran and Bianca--to help with her research by becoming Pokemon trainers and cataloguing the many species of Pokemon for listing in the Pokedex. She also gives you one of three Pokemon to take on your journey: Snivy the grass snake, Tepig the fire pig, or Oshawott the sea otter. Pokemon in hand, you're free to explore the Unova region, interacting with the eccentric inhabitants of its towns and cities, as well as members of Team Plasma, whose cartoonish villainy forms the basis of the story. Deviating from the cozy stories of previous installments, the narrative takes a slightly darker turn, touching on the morality of keeping Pokemon. Should they be incarcerated in Pokeballs? Is it right to battle them? Should they be freed? Sadly, these elements aren't deeply explored, with many of the questions simply glossed over--a missed opportunity to give the game a more mature edge.            "
286,Resident Evil 4 (2005),9.0,2,"Remember Resident Evil 4's original GameCube case? The one that said ""Only For"" in the corner? It's hard to imagine now, considering the game has been ported every which way, to the Nokia phone and back. But despite its acclaimed status, all its ports, and the modest visual facelift it has received over the years, one thing remains woefully unchanged and firmly cements Resident Evil 4 in 2005 when it was originally released: those damned tank controls. Even the Wii Edition (the best port of the game, I must say) was shackled by its rigid movement. That is, until Resident Evil 4 VR, which presents the game in its best light since its original release.Playing through the action-horror classic on the Oculus Quest 2 has given me a feeling I've wanted since first finishing RE4 16 years ago on the GameCube: the sense of experiencing it for the first time all over again. And that feeling is downright awesome.From the ground up, the game has been meticulously recreated in Unreal Engine 4 in uncanny detail to fully function in VR, and the result is so impressive; it's nothing short of magic. From upscaled textures, to sound effects, and animations, RE4 can now be seen--quite literally--through an entirely new lens. Stepping into the shoes of protagonist and pretty boy Leon S. Kennedy on a mission to save the president's daughter has never felt cooler, nor has the horror representation of eastern Europe ever felt more frightening.Nearly everything has been updated to accommodate VR: your equipment is now accessible on your physical body--grab at your waist for your pistol, shoulder for your knife, chest for a grenade, and utility belt for weapon magazines. This means physically loading your gun and cocking it before firing it off, unsheathing your knife to break open crates, or pulling the pin on a grenade and letting it cook before tossing it at the feet of some Ganados. And performing nearly every action made me feel like a total president-daughter-saving badass.VR has excelled at first-person combat, and it shines exceptionally well in RE4VR. Shooting dynamite out of someone's hands, juking out of the way of a thrown hatchet, unloading a submachine gun with one hand and pulling out a pistol with the other to shoot off enemies next to me, all felt so satisfying. Even just opening cabinets was an oddly thrilling new way to interact with a world I know so well.Pumping a shotgun and squeezing the trigger point-blank in an enemy's face, followed with a blood-drenched explosion of their skull, only for tentacles to erupt from their neck up close and personal in VR is gasp-inducing, and even when I was shaking with anxiety, I had a smile on my face from ear to ear.While its combat is far more versatile in ways the original never could be, like dual-wielding a knife and pistol, or a shotgun and sub-machine gun, don't be fooled: the odds still stacked against me and each onslaught of Ganados felt harrowing--RE4VR still manages to capture the tension and stress of the original very well. And, honestly, dual wielding and guns blazing is rarely a route worth taking, as it can be a waste of resources. There's no denying it got me out of some dire situations, though.As previously mentioned, actions that were once a simple button press now require physicality from the player, like opening cabinets, drawers, toggling switching, turning door keys, and solving puzzles--it's all done using real-life motion. It's a little touch, and not an entirely remarkable idea for a VR title, but it remains effective in elevating the Resident Evil 4 experience. Being able to pull open drawers, or slowly ease through a door to see what's around the corner, has a huge impact on immersion and helps the game feel like a new and modern experience. Even saving on a typewriter now involves physically pressing the mechanical keys of an early 20th-century typewriter. It's such a simple delight.Resident Evil 4 VR presents the game in its best light since its original release ... Playing through on the Oculus Quest 2 has given me the sense of experiencing it for the first time all over againSome things are locked to button presses, and rightfully so, like jumping out a window or hopping over a barrier, which switches to a third-person perspective in those moments. For me, who experiences minor motion sickness, I was grateful for this, but your mileage may vary. You can also opt to remain in first-person thanks to an option found in the settings.Seeing RE4's iconic enemies and environments up close emphasizes the feeling of experiencing it for the first time again. I watched a Ganando creep towards me while I fumbled to reload my pistol. I noticed detail in their face I had never seen before: eyes vacant and googly, with their mouth slightly ajar and crooked. It made an already unsettling enemy feel far more eerie and intrusive.Environments I had seen a dozen times before in my previous console playthroughs felt all the more engrossing. I took more time to observe the haunting Victorian paintings in the castle, or the cart filled with corpses by the farm. Just looking at the dirty water in the well as I reached into to pick up treasure made me want to wash my hands in real life.The accessibility options are plentiful, with many available to accommodate player needs in VR. They range from full motion to standing, sitting down, and allow adjustments for whether you're right- or left-handed. There are also different modes of interaction, such as Immersive, which puts all the gear and weapons on your physical body, or Comfort mode, where your arsenal can be switched and rotated through with a few button presses. Additionally, there are a wealth of options to tweak and finesse your ideal playing experience. I played in Immersive mode, standing, with teleportation movement, and quick 180 turned on, for the entirety of my 13-hour playthrough (spread out over 1-2 hour increments), and seldom experienced any discomfort.But not everything works as well as it's intended. Counter moves in particular are a mechanic I abandoned using early in my playthrough. Counter moves, like kicks and suplexes, can be performed after stunning an enemy by shooting them in the knees or in the face. In these moments, I found myself clumsily fumbling to get close enough to an enemy to press the button and initiate the attack, often completely missing the window of chance and thrusting myself into harm's way unintentionally. The action felt clumsy and unintuitive compared to the physical motion of everything else, so I eventually stopped using it.Some boss fights also don't translate smoothly into VR. Del Lago, the swamp boss fight, in particular, proved to be a point of frustration. Controlling the boat, while being pulled along by the giant beast, and having to simultaneously load a harpoon gun and fire it was a lot to manage--it's something that worked well on console, but having the full motion of VR while operating multiple things at once was a little too disorienting.To my surprise, however, parts I dreaded returning to from the original, specifically the game's final action-focused act, were actually improved thanks to VR. Traditionally, considering RE4's original rigid movement and lack of cover system, fighting off the game's final military armed foes was usually a slow slog to run around a corner, only to get a shot in before scurrying away. Pacing in the original game became disjointed and out of character in these moments. But in VR, the action is amplified thanks to being able to physically duck around corners, take cover, shoot through openings in the wall, or toss grenades out. It felt amazing and made getting into a shootout with crossbow-wielding, gattling gun-shooting, axe-throwing goons a total blast.This exhilarating implementation of combat makes the lack of Mercenaries Mode all the more apparent. Playing RE4's action segments through VR lenses left me wanting to see how its action-horror can translate in the arcade-style experience of Mercenaries, so its absence is a minor letdown. So instead, the moment the credits rolled, I began my second playthrough on New Game+, with plans to run through an additional, harder, Professional difficulty mode.There's no game I've completed more times in my life than Resident Evil 4, and experiencing it via a different format is an astonishing experience. Bringing the 16-year-old classic to VR doesn't just reaffirm why it's a classic to begin with, but also gives it a place among the best VR games on offer. And it's evident that building the game from the ground up was a labor of love.RE4VR is an essential game to have in your Oculus Quest 2 library, right alongside Beat Saber and Superhot. It is a welcoming version to newcomers that are VR-capable, and, most excitingly, not only will new players get to experience RE4 in a new way that doesn't compromise the original's greatness (and even its quirks), but a new generation of players will get to hear Leon S. Kennedy's campy one-liners. And that's a prospect I'm very excited about."
3125,Section 8: Prejudice,8.0,2,"Section 8 to create an expansive and intense adventure that offers a lot more content than you would expect from an Xbox Live Arcade game. A full-fledged single-player campaign is the biggest addition to the franchise, and it provides enough challenge and variety to lure even seasoned veterans into the fold. The competitive multiplayer hasn't seen as much improvement, but there's no denying the fun of gunning down a feeble trooper while you're stomping around in an oversized mech. Prejudice doesn't offer any significant additions to the genre and lacks the narrative punch to invest you in this universe, but it rises above small quibbles to offer a consistently enjoyable experience no matter which mode you play.         There is a story that revolves around the inherent prejudice space marines have to deal with, but its underdeveloped characters make it difficult to care about the high-stakes events. It's the gameplay in Prejudice that's worth caring about. On the surface, Prejudice looks like a cheap Halo knockoff. The bulky armor your fellow soldiers wear gives off a serious Master Chief vibe, and the rock-formation paths that make up most of the single- and multiplayer levels look like they could have been created in a Forge editor. But once that aesthetic familiarity wears off, you're treated to a shooter that has its own identity. You have a rocket pack with a limited fuel supply strapped to your back at all times, and smartly using this in both your offensive rushes and defensive scrambles adds a tactical layer to the run-and-gun proceedings. To counter your soaring opponents, you can lock on to them with a click of a button, but this ability can be used only periodically. Because your most powerful tools have to be used sparingly, you are forced to carefully think about your plan of action rather than rush in willy-nilly. It's a nice balance that makes it feel as if you're making strides with every hour you sink in.     Which weapons you use requires just as much thought. There are seven types available, ranging from long-range snipers to explosive rocket launchers, and you can carry only two at a time. This is a fairly standard way to distribute weapons, but Prejudice makes things a bit more interesting. You choose what types of bullets you want to use as well and equipping yourself wisely can mean the difference between life and death. For instance, crash rounds are great against vehicles whereas slugs dish out high armor damage. There are also tools you need to concern yourself with. These include a repair wrench (for vehicles, structures, and fellow soldiers), grenades, and a knife. Melee attacks aren't standard in Prejudice. If you decide to equip something other than your knife, you can't attack with a close-range swipe, so you need to make sure you plan your line of attack before you enter battle. With so many different strategies, you need to play a few hours to wrap your head around how all of your weapons work together, and you even unlock more ammo types as you get deeper into the game.      It's a shame the controls can't quite live up to the vast array of abilities you have to play around with. That's not to say that it's difficult to move or shoot, but it's not nearly as smooth as the best games in the genre. This is immediately apparent when you first try to fire at a moving enemy. Your reticle is sluggish by default, and even when you tweak the sensitivity, it still doesn't glide as smoothly as you'd like. In battle, this means the difference between killing your foe in 20 shots rather than 10, and that can be frustrating in a heated fight. The lock-on feature helps alleviate this slightly, but you can't rely on that crutch all the time. The tank and mech feel much better than they did in the first Section 8, but they often put you at a competitive disadvantage. These monstrous machines get stuck on geological formations too easily, and because the camera zooms out to a third-person perspective when you're piloting them, your perspective is sometimes obscured by buildings, enemies, and natural landmarks. On the other hand, the hovercraft is a blast to pilot and quite powerful, which instantly makes it the most formidable vehicle in your fleet.        You have plenty of time to come to grips with your vast supply of weapons and vehicles in the lengthy single-player campaign. Unlike the original Section 8, which simply reused the multiplayer maps, this is a from-scratch adventure that does a fine job of mixing up your objectives to keep things fresh. In one section, you may have to storm a battlefield occupied by an evil force. Turrets and missile launchers track your every movement, sniper riflemen keep you on your toes, and grenadiers ensure you don't stay in one spot. Surviving an encounter with entrenched enemies intent on seeing you dead is an exhilarating rush, and because there are so many different ways to attack, you're free to use whatever strategy you deem best. At another time, you may be the occupying force trying to hold back an invading army, and it's just as much fun when the roles are reversed. You plant turrets where you want and call in supply terminals so you can reequip yourself on the fly, and you can even order up a mech suit if you feel like making people quake.      Prejudice doesn't limit itself to wide-open battlefields either. Certain sections force you to fight in narrow confines, and though this lacks the freedom of the large-scale battles, it's a welcome change in pacing nonetheless. It's in these sections that the difficulty ramps up, forcing you to rely on your raw killing ability to stay alive. Enemies are fast and relentless in Prejudice, and if you fall asleep for a second, you could find yourself surrounded by a group of rocket-toting toughs. The challenge is usually welcome, but there are a few sections that border on frustrating. Like you, enemies are sometimes equipped with a healing wrench, and when you have to take on a battalion of healers at once, it can definitely try your patience. They have a knack for repeatedly healing their friends whenever you chip away at their shields, and this cycle can be tricky to triumph against, especially when your own allies are hanging well back of the action. These odd difficulty spikes appear only a couple of times throughout the adventure, but they can halt your progress in a hurry.         Once you fight your way through the roughly 7-hour single-player campaign, it's time to turn your sights to the multiplayer endeavors. As in Section 8, there's only one competitive offering, though that's not nearly as limiting as it sounds. In Conquest, two teams (up to 32 players, with bots filling in vacant spots) try to earn 1,000 points first. You do this by capturing control points, killing enemies, and completing mini objectives. These side objectives are what turn this from a ho-hum game of ""capture the outpost"" into a volatile game of tug-of-war. Dynamic Combat Missions (DCMs) crop up in the middle of battles and shift your focus to impromptu events. These include missions such as protecting (or killing) a VIP, collecting intelligence from the other team's base, and securing a jammer. You earn big points for completing (or thwarting) one of these goals, so you need to keep your eyes on the HUD to know what needs to be done and where. These missions are entirely optional, so if you'd rather protect your home base or just kill your foes, you're free to do so, or you can run around healing everything that limps if that's your bag. There are tons of ways to be a productive member of your team, and it's a lot of fun to mix up your tactics and lend a hand wherever it's needed.      New in Prejudice is Swarm. This is a cooperative mode that pits four friends against a never-ending horde of enemy attackers. You have to protect your base at all costs, and you have free rein to plant turrets and call in vehicles to help you hold back the flood. Swarm isn't nearly as exciting as the ever-changing Conquest mode, but it does add a bit more variety to this already expansive package. Organizing your tactic with a group of friends can be a lot of fun, especially when you get a couple of people patrolling around the outside of your base with hovercycles while the other two fire rocket blasts from above. Unfortunately, there are only a few different maps in Swarm, so the enjoyment is short-lived. You can bump up the difficulty level once you master the terrain, but it's not quite enough to give this mode legs. However, it's a worthy addition to the franchise and a good chance to team up with some pals to tear down a computer-controlled army.        There isn't much that Prejudice doesn't do well. Just about every element of Section 8 has been improved in some way, resulting in a refined shooter that never fails to entertain. Even though the core mechanics are solid and the weapons are varied, Prejudice lacks the creative spark that could have made this something special. The expansive campaign does a fine job of mixing up your objective types, but it doesn't do anything you haven't seen before. It's fun while it lasts, but you'll be hard pressed to remember anything specific that occurred when the ending credits roll. And the competitive offering is guilty of the same problem. Prejudice won't change the way you play shooters, but it's still a really enjoyable game, and at 1,200 MS points ($15), it's a great value.    "
1057,NHL 18,7.0,2,"After stumbling on current gen consoles starting with NHL 15, the NHL series is starting to hit its stride, with a wide variety of improvements and additions to the core game in recent iterations. In NHL 18, most of these improvements are aimed at new or casual players, but hardcore hockey heads haven't been forgotten. From its generous list of modes ranging from full-season to the exciting NHL Threes, to how the action on the ice feels smooth and deliberate, NHL 18 is a fun yet accessible sports game.When you're out on the ice, NHL 18 feels fantastic. There's a feeling of weight to the players crashing into each other, making each check feel satisfying. Passing and controlling the puck is smooth and fast, and when you outsmart the defense and score a goal, it's a genuine fist-pumping moment. The new dekes open up fresh possibilities of outsmarting your defenders. Passing the puck around the ice, screening the goalie, and then putting a wrister into the goal always feels purposeful and satisfying. There's no button mashing here unless you want it, in which case you can set the game to NHL '94's ultra-simplified 2-button controls.The new modes like NHL Training Camp, NHL Threes, and Expansion Draft feature in Franchise mode bring new ways to play, but returning gamers will find the core NHL experience familiar. Gameplay is largely the same as it always has been. The commentary is basic, repetitive, and the delivery and excitement don't always match the on-screen action.The soundtrack, too, is limited. There are very few songs, so they repeat on the menu screens frequently. Songs like Kaleo's Hot Blood and The North Panic's Haven't You Heard? become annoying from repetition.Of the new mode additions, NHL Threes feels the freshest, and controls exactly the same as the rest of the game while keeping an arcade feel, slacking on penalties and rules found in the simulation modes. I enjoyed slamming other players in situations where I'd normally be penalized, particularly the opposing team's goalie for stopping play.But the beauty of all this variety, besides having something for everyone, is how one mode complements another. Playing NHL Threes is a great way to get a feel for the basics of the game--skating, shooting, and hitting--without worrying too much about the rules. It makes the on-ice time in something like season play that much more dynamically, because it allows you to get a better feel for the way NHL 18 moves and plays. The MyCareer mode lets you start off with your own custom player, and play your way from amateur to professional, building exactly the type of player you want to build. It gets your foot in the door for a full season mode, controlling each team, switching between players on the fly--which hones your hockey skills, helping you dominate NHL Threes. It's cyclical. Playing any single mode makes you better at any of the other modes. It's awesome.While Madden and NBA 2K have both taken the single-player experience and turned them into compelling story modes, NHL 18 makes no such effort. You set up your player, play in the junior leagues, and move up from there. It's generic. Building on the MyCareer mode would have made a great addition for returning players, but instead it's just more of the same we've seen in every previous sports game for years.But NHL 18 is welcoming in every possible way to new users. One of the most difficult things about sports games is learning the vocabulary of each title. In the past, jumping back into a series, or starting for the first time, seemed overwhelming. The NHL Training Camp is great for returning users to learn some of the new moves, and invaluable for helping rookies get a feel for the game.Visually, NHL 18 doesn't reach the same heights as other sports sims on the market right now. The crowds especially fare poorly, looking more like Sims characters than actual humans. When the camera pans the crowd, the animation looks canned and often suffers from framerate stutters. Actual gameplay is fluid, but transitional animations are non-existent. It doesn't look natural in up-close replays when a character goes from skating, to scoring, to celebrating.New players won't feel lost, as NHL goes out of its way to make sure you get up to speed with training, tutorials, and on-screen hints.There's still a lot to love about NHL 18, even if the core on-ice experience has only seen minor tweaks. The new modes bring variety to the gameplay, with NHL Threes standing out as a fast-paced, fun way to play hockey. No matter what the mode, gameplay is fast, responsive, and rewarding. And those fresh to the franchise won't feel lost, as NHL goes out of its way to make sure you get up to speed with training, tutorials, and on-screen hints. New players are sure to feel welcome, but for any series veterans, NHL 18 still has some room to improve."
689,Anno 1800,7.0,2,"At the heart of Anno 1800 lies an intimidating and complex financial simulation. It may seem like you're overseeing the rise and occasional fall of a European-style city as it comes of industrial age. But really, you're juggling numbers, thumb wedged in the accounts ledger, finessing production efficiencies and stabilizing trade fluctuations. Anno 1800 is perhaps the prettiest spreadsheet I've ever seen.Each randomly generated map in the core sandbox mode unfurls as a mostly blank canvas, a glistening sea dotted with fertile islands waiting to be claimed by you and your (AI or human) opponents. As you grow and expand your reach across multiple islands and into the New World--and your empire undergoes its Industrial Revolution--you'll employ more advanced technologies, extracting coal and oil to fuel great belching factories and formidable steam engines. But the basic principle remains constant: Satisfy your population by employing them to manufacture natural resources into commodities that encourage more people to move to your cities.Everything becomes a production chain for you to configure, massage and optimize. Early on the choices you're making here are relatively simple; the virgin terrain of your first settlement makes it easy to place the knitter near the farm so the wool is delivered swiftly and the warehouse within range so the finished goods can be collected for immediate sale. But soon the need for a navy means you've had to build a sailmaker's yard which is now diverting wool previously used by the knitter. Building another sheep farm means finding the physical space for an additional farm as well as for all the extra housing for the new farmers. Extend this scenario a few hours into a game and it will encompass dozens of productions chains of increasing complexity and inter-connectivity.Managing these productions chains--whether it's work clothes and sails or beer and pocket watches--is an enjoyable exercise in a kind of ""balancing the books"" sense. You know you have to spend resources to grow, but your success depends on finding that ever-moving sweet spot between overreaching and not pushing far enough. It's necessary to keep the requisite resources flowing and meet the housing and job demands of your population, but it's not sufficient. To maintain a firm hand on your economy you have to appreciate the various financial levers available to you, allowing fine adjustments to tax rates and production ratios that can genuinely mean the difference between keeping it in the black and going bankrupt.Of course, it's also just as enjoyable to play the more visual puzzle game of city planning, slotting in that new building not only where its specific dimensions fit, but where it also retains proximity to its related structures in the chain. Nobly assisting matters here is the ""move"" tool that lets you--for no resource cost at all--pick up and move any building to another location. Need to pop a police station downtown but there's no room? Just move the nearby houses further down the street to open up the space. It really does look utterly beautiful when it all comes together, too, like an exquisitely detailed diorama that you can poke, prod and tweak to your heart’s content. There’s even a first-person mode that lets you walk the streets and observe all your townsfolk going about their day to day business. I especially welcomed the moments I was able to spend admiring the view before some new urgent matter warranted investigation and I had to return to crunching those numbers.Spinning all the plates becomes even trickier as you advance into the Industrial Age. Production chains that were once straightforward, one-to-one input/output ratios turn into logistical nightmares as multiple buildings start feeding into multiple other buildings. The demands of the job are only exacerbated by a lack of clarity in the feedback you're given when things aren't operating at full capacity. Simple things like knowing how many flour mills and grain farms support a bakery just aren't communicated clearly enough in-game or in the non-existent manual. I spent hours engaged in trial and error in such situations before finding a comprehensive external wiki that I found myself alt-tabbing to constantly while I played.There is a campaign mode that functions as a tutorial before it segues into the main sandbox. And there is an additional setting that enables a more guided experience, providing you with specific goals at the appropriate moments. I found both very welcome, even as someone who had played some of the previous Anno games. But at the same time, I felt that other important aspects weren't explained thoroughly enough, if at all, and it was frustrating to guess at solutions to problems I wasn't confident I'd even diagnosed correctly.Much of Anno 1800 is spent watching numbers go up and down. Total gold is going down. Now it's going back up again. There aren't enough workers for the number of available jobs. Okay, now there are too many workers and not enough engineers. Sometimes it's clear why these things are happening and sometimes it's obvious what you can do to rectify the situation. However, other times it isn't and it's really quite panic-inducing. My stomach tightened whenever the numbers plummeted into the red, but as soon as they shot back into the black I would feel a surge of relief. Even so, outside of these sharp swings, when the numbers remained relatively stable and my economy seemed to be ticking over steadily, I couldn't shake this nagging sense that everything was always on the verge of complete collapse.I spent all of my time playing Anno 1800 in a mild yet pervasive state of anxiety. As a city-building sim that emphasizes economic management, it is as robust and powerful as the steel factories it allows you to pollute the skies with. But for all the natural beauty of its island paradise and the architectural splendor of its churches, theatres, and piers, it's just a little too cold in its reliance on numbers and a little too impenetrable in its reluctance to show you its workings. I'm glad I visited, but I don't think I'd want to live there."
2,You Will Die Here Tonight,4.0,0,"In the opening of You Will Die Here Tonight (YWDHT), my Resident Evil-inspired super-cop solved a confusing book-based puzzle and ventured into a secret underground lab, where she was then met with a monologue from her ally-turned-enemy. To my surprise, this Albert Wesker-like big bad then shot my character dead--all in the first 15 minutes. It was like starting a Resident Evil game in the final scene and then getting a dark ending where the villains prevail. With a touch of meta commentary on the genre, this unconventional introduction was an intriguing start, but also the last part of the game I truly enjoyed, as the game thereafter ran through too-common horror tropes without cleverly subverting or enhancing them ever again.In the aptly titled You Will Die Here Tonight, Resident Evil is the blueprint for a two- to four-hour-long isometric, survival-horror game with a touch of roguelite progression. That fun intro I detailed would've been a neat story track to stay on, as the big bad who seems to prevail quickly discovers there's another unseen hand, more powerful than her own, that is pulling the strings. But the game oddly drops this pretense in favor of a roguelite system whereby, when a character dies, you assume the role of another member of A.R.I.E.S. (the legally distinct and totally-not-S.T.A.R.S. division of police officers) keeping all story items with the opportunity to recover other scraps if you can find the body of your predecessor.The dissonance between that story-heavy opening scene and what follows winds up feeling like two different games that somehow both made it into the final version. Each character plays the same but offers different text lines, with a few seeming quite serious and others offering bothersome jokes that wouldn't land at some middle school lunch tables. The mansion-like setting with secret labs, a torture dungeon, and some high-end offices and libraries is very much akin to a setting from Capcom's seminal series, and the roundabout way you navigate this space--solving convoluted puzzles and gathering various items to open doors and collect new weapons--is all meant to take you back to the late '90s, when games like this were most prevalent.The problem, however, is the genre has improved for the better since then, and YWDHT feels like a reversion to something worse. Some of the puzzles and encounters feel downright unfair, like the game's name is a promise more than a threat. Once, I had to escape a charging boulder, but the character's sprinting speed and the nearest corner to duck into seemed to mean I was meant to die unavoidably, and I did, which allowed my next character to move past where the mass of rock originally sat. Other times, the puzzles could find the right balance between obtuse and satisfying, but never often enough.Though the game uses an isometric angle most of the time, it switches into first-person for combat, which is a neat idea but winds up being quite boring in execution. Surrounded by multiple plain-looking zombies, headshots were always very easy to land. Conserving ammo and switching to my knife was a wise choice when facing few enemies, but the visuals made it hard to measure the distance between a zombie and me, leading to me frequently slashing at the air over and over until a zombie shambled into the pointy end.The only time it was a major issue was when the game threw so many zombies at me at once, so quickly, that I again took it as a promise that the game wanted me to go through the story having lost at least a few characters. But to that end, I always felt indifferent from a narrative standpoint. The story doesn't characterize anyone much past that cool intro or the aforementioned corny jokes, so when I'd lose a character, its only practical effect was to make me worry about what happened when I lost them all.Eventually, I purposely got them all killed to see what would happen, only to be met with an arcade-style ""continue"" screen, which picked up right where I left off and fully refreshed my roster of playable characters. This became an even more perplexing design conundrum for me to ponder. Why threaten the loss of characters, and furthermore, why seemingly script some deaths into the game if nothing happens once they're all gone? Again, this made YWDHT feel like a collection of disparate horror game ideas, some of which may have worked better in isolation, somewhat tweaked, or with other conflicting ideas excluded. But in totality as they are here, they just don't mesh.While the puzzles sometimes clicked and the story had at least that one early bright spot, the audiovisual aspects of the game are only straining. The game strives for a retro aesthetic, but does this faithfully only in that it's grainy and drab. There's no strong use of shadows--just lit and unlit areas, the latter of which you can't enter anyway. Many locales within the vast castle-like setting are an eyesore. It's hard to imagine a game chasing the nostalgia of late-'90s horror games without including a memorable soundtrack, but such is the case here. Music is almost uninvolved, surprisingly, and things like monster growls and ambient audio don't do much at all to fill in a scene.The game is brief and polished, so I think it's possible someone who loves the games You Will Die Here Tonight is affectionately cribbing could manage to enjoy this too, but probably only if they're really itching for something else to play. There's no shortage of games resurrecting this style, and many of them have been memorable. Others have been worse, but at least some have been interesting in their shortcomings. The overarching issue with You Will Die Here Tonight is that the death alluded to in its title can be attributed to boredom."
3714,Sega Home Run King 2,5.0,1,"  In Sega Home Run King 2, you play as one of two equal and opposite home run derby batters--the brawny KC, or the skillful Little Willy. Either way, you'll be swinging at tosses from a nameless pitcher, hoping to knock the balls out of the park and into targets in the distant cityscape. Billboards, buildings, and even UFOs respond with animations and sound effects whenever they're hit, which is all pretty cool. Unfortunately, the central batting mechanic and corresponding animation are broken, as are several other elements of this simple game.         Like most home run derby games on mobile, HRK2 can be played with the use of only one button. Timing is the only skill at play here. When you press the OK button, your batting arms will move slightly, but you'll never see yourself connect with the ball. This is tremendously disconcerting, even when said ball turns red, indicating that it's about to sail out of the park. The visual representation of bat and ball connecting is the only truly essential animation in a home run derby game, and Sega Mobile has messed it up here. To make matters worse, once the ball is hit it will move at about two frames per second. Nevertheless, if you hit a few home runs in a row you'll fill up a bat meter, which represents your momentum. It would make sense for a full bat meter to impart players with NBA Jam-like ""on fire"" skills, but this isn't the case. The meter has no visible effect on gameplay, and instead it serves as a score multiplier.      When you fail to hit a home run, you'll invariably hit a pop fly. For whatever reason, a certain number of these pop flies will cause the pitcher to hit the deck like a Little Leaguer encountering his first line drive. This is a strange occurrence, because these balls are always hit several yards above the pitcher's mound. It's the equivalent of ducking because an airplane is passing overhead. Pitchers without depth perception are bad news.      HRK2's audio is probably its best feature on the LG VX7000. Every element of the skyline yields some sound when hit with a home run ball. The breaking of windows is, of course, the most common sound byte. These urban targets also animate in neat ways, such as a Coke sign that pours a drink when it's hit. It's just too bad that the actual batting is so off.       Home Run King 2 isn't recommendable, simply because it fails to deliver a decent batting experience. Elements of the game's presentation are excellent, but they lack a foundation of good gameplay on which to rest. Furthermore, the inclusion of two fictional batters does not measure up to the huge real-world player rosters licensed in other games. Given the wealth of home run derby games on mobile, there's no reason to play this one.     "
1827,TRI,8.0,2," As I took my first inverted steps onto the ceiling of an expansive temple, slowly following my carefully constructed path of triangular stepping stones, I had my moment. It's a moment I imagine everyone experiences early in Rat King Entertainment's first-person puzzler--when you shatter the laws of the universe and do the impossible, finally realizing the full extent of the TRI's creative power. The TRI artifact is the titular crux of the experience, the source of power, allowing you to craft triangles by anchoring three points on nearly any surface. It's a simple premise strategically refined for endless possibilities: as platforms to span gaps and cover hazards, as a gravity-free walking path up walls and across ceilings, and as a way of impeding and reflecting the flow of light, to name but three of its many applications. These powers and ways to interact with the environment are slowly incorporated into your bag of tricks across TRI's sixteen levels. And while the open-world nature of each stage certainly encourages exploration and experimentation--reinforced through unlockable bonus-content collectibles tucked away in deviously hard-to-reach crevices--the invisible guiding hand of smart design is always thoughtfully at work behind the scenes. In each level, three fox statues must be reached, collected, and returned to a central altar in order to progress. These objectives are carefully laid out, but the means by which they're achieved are entirely up to you. It's a careful balance of focused obstacles and creative problem solving that encourages a sense of triumph with every temple successfully delved. Once completed, levels may be returned to in pursuit of a better performance; and through a challenge mode tethered to every stage, you're free to put up your best completion time against the community, attempt to use the fewest number of triangles, or collect everything there is to find. Pushing you between these environments is a serviceable story centered on a schism between the Odd Gods, deities in the form of foxes. Though each short cutscene interspersed between levels is beautifully illustrated with artful style, I regularly found myself fighting to stay engaged with the slow-drip narrative delivery--a symptom of the comparatively dense levels often requiring an hour or more to fully explore and complete. Short spurts of exposition and glimpses of the otherworldly critter roaming each temple do help to mitigate the imbalance between gameplay and narrative, but the ultimate story I found in each sprawling environment was that of my own victories of ingenuity. And while the vast majority of TRI is cleanly realized, slight technical hiccups and moments of finicky collision punctuate the experience. For example, crates and other objects held in-hand will often spasm and orientate strangely after slightly bumping into the environment--a particular nuisance when trying to maneuver them between rooms through tight hallways or tunnels. Yet such issues are minor, and rarely overshadow the core tenets that make TRI great. Rat King Entertainment has laid impressive claim to the first-person puzzle genre, deftly filling the vacuum created in the years following the Portal series. And perhaps the fact that TRI is so reminiscent of that famous experience--the simple mechanic used to great, creative effect--speaks for itself. Yet where Portal was exacting, linear, razor-focused and narratively driven, TRI is an open, dreamy experience, propelled by exploration and personal conquests in playful jungle gyms. Regardless of comparisons, TRI: Of Friendship and Madness is a fantastically executed return to the well of first-person spatial tinkering. Despite minor blemishes and inconsistencies, it offers up task after engaging task, only ever telling you where to go, never how to get there. And soon after stepping foot into its world, you'll learn to defy the laws of nature, and beat it at its own trickery--then, you'll be thinking with triangles. "
2303,Resident Evil 6,4.0,0,"  With Resident Evil 6, a once-mighty series makes another stumble. From a production standpoint, this atmospheric third-person shooter (this is no survival horror game, certainly) hits a number of high notes, weaving multiple stories into a single narrative that you untangle from different perspectives. It's unfortunate that actually interacting with Resident Evil 6 is an excruciating chore. This is a wannabe action film that resents your interference, and punishes you by forcing one horrible quick-time event after another upon you.         In a typical five-minute stretch, you might watch a cutscene, walk for five seconds, trigger another cutscene, open a door, perform a quick-time event, view another cutscene, shoot some mutated freaks, and then do nothing while you wait for your co-op partner to finish some task or another before you can continue on. All through that stretch, the camera changes position countless times, you're forced to walk really slowly for a while, and an almost-unavoidable scripted ""gotcha"" moment gifts you with a game-over screen (""You Are Dead""), forcing you to replay the sequence while wondering what you could have done to prevent it.      These problems infiltrate all four of Resident Evil 6's campaigns, though each campaign shifts its focus and tone--and all but Ada Wong's puzzle-driven campaign (unlocked when you have finished the other three) feature cooperative play. In Leon Kennedy's campaign, you play as either Leon or newcomer Helena Harper, while your cohort is left to the care of another player, or of the AI. Leon's campaign is the most traditional, recalling the fourth and fifth chapters of the series by way of mysterious locations like an eerie graveyard and creep-strewn city streets. In a campaign that looks to military shooters for inspiration, Chris Redfield joins fellow BSAA operative Piers Nivens in war-torn streets to shoot up infected foes and larger-than-life bosses. Jake Muller and Sherry Birkin's campaign is focused more on scripted events than the others and lacks the thematic cohesion of the other three (unless you count an overload of contextual button prompts as a theme). A short prelude introduces you to the basic mechanics, which are mostly identical across the campaigns. It also functions as a warning of what's to come.            Resident Evil 6 is constantly (and annoyingly) playing with camera angles, even outside of the running sections. The worst moments are those that yank control from you and force you to stare at a growling behemoth's dramatic entrance, or a helicopter's flyover, even when you're in the middle of a quick-time event, or engaged in a shoot-out. Smart games either have you hold a button if you want to witness a major incident, or simply allow the incident to happen. Resident Evil 6 is not a smart game. It doesn't care what you're doing: that monster is big, and the game forces the bigness upon you. (And when the sequence is done, the camera may not be in the position in which it started.) Such occurrences are, every time, detrimental to gameplay, and it's shocking how many of them there are.      Not that your co-op partner is usually harmful to the experience. If you play on your own, the AI does a great job of knowing what to do and where to go. The game does have a few good co-op ideas up its sleeve, such as a sequence in which one player swims from the snapping jaws of a finned fiend, and the other must shoot it. But the good ideas are too often let down by troublesome execution: in that same sequence, your mission objective might contradict what the game actually needs you to do. Other times, one player waits around with nothing to do, while the other slashes up bio-organic weapons (that is, B.O.W.s) and finally opens a door or lowers a ladder. Most cooperative actions simply involve opening a door together. And boy is there a lot of door opening in Resident Evil 6.       In between the frequent set pieces, the quick-time events, and the cooperative door kickings, there is some mutant killing. The core mechanics are similar to those in other third-person shooters, but with the idiosyncrasies that defined Resident Evils 4 and 5. The camera stays close behind your back, movements like leaping and crouching are contextual rather than freely available, and the pace is deliberate. Shooting grotesqueries often results in new mutations: bulbous growths sprout from the necks of advancing fiends, and disgusting diminutive creatures spawn from their hosts and skitter along the floor. You can also kick and pummel your foes, though whether you prefer to keep your distance or get right in there, the lumbering lunatics react properly, knocking over other infected as they lurch from the power of your shotgun blasts. If you find the deliberate action appealing, you can devote some time to the returning Mercenaries mode, in which you and a buddy (or you alone) off as many enemies as you can before the clock ticks down to zero.            That isn't to say that Resident Evil 6 is hard. On medium difficulty, you can often run right past the baddies, or just spam a trigger and punch them to death. You needn't worry about ammo all that often; the only time you're likely to run out is when you face a bullet-sponge boss and there's no more ammo to be had in the battle arena. But while you won't often die due to the level of challenge (unless you crank up the difficulty, of course), you might not be able to escape a few of the game's ""gotcha"" deaths. With little warning, a vehicle might crash through a barricade, and if you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, you're dead. When an avalanche occurs, if you don't know to expect it, you might not have enough room to veer your snowmobile away. (This is one of several mediocre vehicular segments.) That's not challenging: that's cheap, and it's bad game design.         But how far can cinematics get you when the gameplay sandwiched between them is so poorly paced, so utterly misconceived, so reliant on stick wriggles and button tapping? There's a place for contextual prompts and cinematic storytelling in video games, but Resident Evil 6 is a mishmash of elements put together without any sense of care or direction. Series faithful might stumble through for the sake of story, and perhaps to appreciate those few moments that recall when Resident Evil was at its peak glory. But this long, poor sequel is the ultimate test of patience for even the most dedicated.      "
3673,Dragon's Lair 3D: Return to the Lair,5.0,1,"A little history for you: In 1983, the video game industry, arcades to be more specific, were in a bad slump. Video games were on the brink of being the silly fad that parents were telling their kids it was. And then along came an incredibly unique and exciting game called Dragon's Lair, a game that, if you listen to the creators of the game, is responsible for saving the video game industry from itself. What made Dragon's Lair unique was its use of laser disc technology to present players with an interactive animated movie in which they could control the hero, which gave the game an unprecedented graphical advantage over the competition. Actually, Dragon's Lair was so unique, there really was no true competition. Now, the original creators of Dragon's Lair have brought back Dirk the Daring for a new adventure, this time in 3D. The result is an unimpressive action platformer with a few of the trappings of the original Dragon's Lair.  One of those trappings is the story, which again follows the bumbling knight Dirk the Daring as he goes on an adventure to save the perpetual damsel-in-distress Daphne from the dastardly duo of the wizard Mordroc and the dragon Singe. The amount of control you had over Dirk in the 1983 Dragon's Lair was limited to some timed directional commands and the occasional timed attack command. Using this simplistic control scheme, you guided Dirk through a series of rooms, which usually boiled down to basic puzzle-solving coupled with hard-core twitch gameplay. DragonStone, the developer of Dragon's Lair 3D, has stayed surprisingly true to this formula. But Dragon's Lair didn't have the most advanced gameplay in 1983, and in 2002, Dragon's Lair 3D has basically turned into an action platformer with a heavy focus on jumping puzzles. Dirk has most of the moves you'd expect from a Lara Croft-type character. He can run, jump, climb ropes and ledges, and dispatch enemies with his sword, and he can even roll up into a ball, just like a certain Samus Aran. It's just that he doesn't do most of this terribly well. The jumping mechanic is the worst--Dirk has only two kinds of jumps, straight up and down or a forward leap, and the game's plentiful and unforgiving jumping puzzles require more precision than these jumps allow. Dragon's Lair 3D predictably suffers from some camera problems that work further to make the jumping puzzles more frustrating than need be. The sword-fighting mechanic is also pretty shoddy, and though there's a lock-on mechanic, enemies are usually pretty slow-witted and benign, and simply running around wildly and hacking at them seems to do the trick just as well. But even without these control problems, the repetitive trial-and-error nature of Dragon's Lair 3D would keep this game from being very compelling.    Dragon's Lair 3D starts with a short animated sequence that sets the scene and is highly reminiscent of the artwork in the original Dragon's Lair. But that's the last you'll see of standard animation in Dragon's Lair 3D. Through the rest of the game, Dragon's Lair 3D attempts to emulate the animated style of the original Dragon's Lair by using the now well-worn cel-shading technique, and its execution feels limp. Only Dirk and some of the enemies you'll encounter have gotten the cel-shading treatment, which creates a certain separation between the characters and their environments. The cel shading feels incredibly mechanical, and the character design doesn't feel particularly inspired. Dirk lacks personality, and he has the same blank expression on his face for most of the game, accompanied by a pretty limited catalog of stiff-looking animations. The environments don't fare much better, and they are uniformly covered in dark, drab-looking textures. The game touts progressive scan support, though considering what you'll be looking at in superhigh resolutions, it's questionable whether you'd want to.  As in the original Dragon's Lair, Dirk isn't a chatty fellow, and his voice acting is limited to a handful of yelps and shrieks. Daphne, however, has fully functioning vocal chords, and she sounds just as squeaky and ditzy as she did in 1983. The rest of the in-game sound in Dragon's Lair 3D is pretty stripped down, save for the orchestral soundtrack, which, though better than the other sound effects, is much less sweeping and grandiose than the word ""orchestral"" implies.    In the rather self-congratulatory History of Dragon's Lair videos included with Dragon's Lair 3D, the creators of the game constantly talk about the glorious ""20 years of Dragon's Lair!"" and like to discuss the innovative nature of Dragon's Lair. But the truth is that if Dragon's Lair 3D is the best thing the game's creators can come up with, they've either just been spinning their wheels for the past 20 years or are completely out of touch with modern video games. Actually, it's probably a little of both. Dragon's Lair 3D is one of those game revivals that bears enough resemblance to its source material to draw up some nostalgia for the original, and yet it also exposes the weaknesses of the original, effectively betraying your nostalgia and retroactively tainting the original game. Players old enough to remember the original Dragon's Lair fondly would be better off checking out the DVD version of the original Dragon's Lair, or better yet, leave Dragon's Lair as a fond memory and move on.

1219,The Last Guardian,9.0,2,"Their tale is a shining example of storytelling through subtle cues and shared experiences; the occasional annoyances that come from trying to force members of two different species to cooperate are part and parcel of their partnership, for better and for worse. But touching moments throughout and an unshakable final act melt these grievances away. The culmination of your incredible journey crystallizes a bond with Trico and makes you immediately long for another adventure with your newfound best friend.It all begins when you awake from a dream to find yourself imprisoned in a mysterious cave. Trico is nearby, subdued by a metal collar, armor, and a pair of spears lodged in its back. Though the cause remains a mystery until the end, you immediately understand the need to remove the weapons and forge an escape. Trico knocks you unconscious after you extract the first spear, but your continued efforts after you wake payoff. In short order, the creature is free from the heavy shackles, and the two of you begin your tricky escape.You and Trico are instrumental to each other's progress; it's easy for you to slip through small passageways and precisely manipulate objects to activate doors, but only Trico can leap dozens of feet into the air and reach high, out-of-the-way places. Your massive companion needs to be coaxed into giving you a hand at first, and food in the form of glowing barrels works as a motivator at times, but you otherwise need to provide directions through physical positioning and vocal commands. Because you move with palpable inertia, running around in search of the next step and managing Trico at the same time can feel taxing, but its a small price to pay for the organic, lifelike animations on display.Success typically comes down to identifying the one object or passage in an environment that allows you to move ahead, and working with Trico to access it. You will climb on the beast's back to reach high ledges, use its tail to descend into pits, and lure it to jump into pools of water so you can ride the resulting wave. But you must accept its slow reaction times and patiently decipher its body language, and it's a process that can test your patience when you've lost your path, dense as the world is with red herrings like intrusive outcrops and heavily ornamented architecture.Yet even at its most disobedient, Trico is an impressive animal to behold, with the mannerisms of a house cat as it rests and slinks through environments, and the temperament of a lion during run-ins with possessed sentinels. Trico will swat and sniff curiosities--sometimes as a hint, other times because it's simply distracted, and the only way to calm your companion after a fight or a scare is through the solace of petting and coos. When you look into Trico's curious eyes as you run out of reach to pull a lever, or when it senses something frightening, you don't see the artifice that defines most video game characters; you see an honest portrayal.Much like a real pet, Trico doesn't automatically learn because you want it to, but its progress yields confidence in your cooperation as it eventually learns to take commands on the first try. This is gratifying from a gameplay perspective, since you feel less like you're wasting time investigating the world and more like you're working in concert with a reliable partner. As an emotionally invested player, your patience is handsomely rewarded by the formation of an unwavering bond.The Last Guardian is, for the most part, a totally convincing experience that draws you into the mindset of Trico and the boy. However, there are times when you're reminded of the game they live in. From beginning to end, without an option to disable it, a button prompt appears when you’re in front of an interactive object. Contrasted with environments that force you to consider every option, it's confusing that the game never trusts you to handle basic tasks and instead opts to interrupt the otherwise complex experience.And despite handling numerous impressive scenes without a hitch, there are a few scenes with obvious frame-rate issues. These occurrences by no means dominate the game--far from it--but they make you consider the technological lattice holding the world together when they appear. It also makes you consider the impossible task Ueda and company likely faced when The Last Guardian was in development for PlayStation 3.The resulting shift to PlayStation 4 has obviously paid off--troubled moments aside, your journey is dominated by awe-inspiring architecture and natural wonder. As you weave in and out of caves and ruins, you're treated to wide views of towers and bridges in the distance that you may never visit, but they live on in your imagination as you piece together the story and world around you."
198,Disney Mirrorverse,4.0,0,"At first glance, Disney Mirrorverse looks and sounds like a child making up a story on the fly with action figures. Characters from all across Disney's catalog--heroes and villains alike--come together to fight off a malevolent force that threatens all of reality. These characters aren't their usual selves, trading in their children's movie personas for something with a little more edge. It's a bold and interesting choice, something never seen before from this group of characters, and this world's mere existence is an exciting prospect. Unfortunately, the boldness of Mirrorverse comes at a cost, literally, as the idea is buried beneath crystalline loot boxes, microtransactions, and convoluted progression. What could have been a whole new world for Disney is instead just the latest run-of-the-mill mobile game.Disney Mirrorverse is an action-RPG set in the titular Mirrorverse, where enemies called the Fractured are growing in power. You battle these hordes with teams of three heroes called Guardians, chosen from the 44 characters who make up the roster. Each of the 44 fills one of four archetypes, Melee, Ranged, Support, and Tank, which informs how they fight. These classes are standard fare: Melee Guardians use swords and other handheld weapons, Ranged heroes rely on magic and projectiles, Tanks stay in the enemy's face while soaking up damage, and Supports heal teammates, debuff enemies, and more. You get new Guardians through Crystals--Mirrorverse's version of loot boxes that are both earned through gameplay and purchased with in-game and real-world currencies. Crystals come in multiple forms, some highlighting specific Guardians or guaranteeing specific ranks, and are opened with typical loot box theatrics via the in-game shop.As a longtime Disney fan, I cannot stress enough how cool it is to see these characters in this new light. Belle from Beauty and the Beast steps out of the library as a powerful mage, wielding a staff powered by the magic rose itself. Her villainous counterpart, Gaston, has gone full Game of Thrones wildling with his massive bow and shoulder-spanning wolf pelt. The lovable bear Baloo dons his Disney Afternoon-era TaleSpin garb and uses a giant plane propeller as a broadsword. Not all characters receive such revolutionary designs--Elsa is an elemental who controls ice, for instance--but even those that don't stray as far from the source have their charm.There are multiple modes in which to send these heroes to battle, the main one being the gigantic Story mode. The story covers seven chapters, each with, at minimum, 10 stages of enemies to conquer. You attack by tapping the corresponding buttons on the bottom-right corner of the screen--basic attack by tapping, strong attack by pressing, and ultimate attack by tapping it once it's activated. You can also move with the joystick appearing on the bottom-left–which can be flicked for a quick dash--and can switch between each of your three Guardians on the fly by tapping their pictures on the top-left. The attack buttons worked without issue, even when switching between tapping and pressing the standard button, but I had a very hard time with the flick-to-dash functionality. Most of the time when I flicked, the Guardian I was controlling would take a small step rather than dash, often resulting in being damaged by the attack I was trying to avoid. A few times this resulted in that Guardian's death, which made the lack of response extra frustrating.Each stage contains between one and four battles, where the team fights enemies until the last one falls, then advances to the next battle automatically. Only the final battle of the stage has any sort of flair: a brief cutscene introducing a Fractured version of a Guardian that acts as the stage's ""boss."" Once that Fractured Guardian is conquered, you see a brief victory pose, collect rewards based on how many stars you earned, and move on to the next stage. There are other formats to explore, including Supply Runs, where you can earn one of the near-infinite currencies in the game, and limited-time events themed around specific Guardians, but this core stage structure remains consistent throughout.Here's where the Disney magic runs out on Mirrorverse: This is the extent of the gameplay experience. Whether you choose story, Supply Runs, or any of the other modes, each stage plays out the same way. When the final battle is over, you see the same victory poses, followed by the same rewards screen, and then it's back to the stage-select menu. It's repetitive to the point of boredom, completely burying any excitement the original concept had created.There is one mode that nearly saves the day, however: 1v1 Showdown. This pits one of your Guardians against a single AI Fractured Guardian across 30 stages, with enemies increasing in power with each stage. While the main three-person battle system can sometimes fill the screen with action, these 1v1 battles are more focused and tense. I get a ""no items, Final Destination"" vibe from these challenges, as the mode distills the battle system down to its purest form. The matches fly by quickly, though, meaning that before you know it, you're at the end of the 30-stage gauntlet, but it is fun while it lasts.However, the majority of your time playing Mirrorverse is spent in the menus, doing everything but battling: gathering quest rewards, purchasing and opening crystals to gain new Guardians, sifting through Mirrorverse's multiple currencies, and so on. I counted eight different types of currency that are used in the game's shop alone, and while most of these are earned through playing the game, Orbs--which are used to purchase the Crystals that unlock the Guardians--can be purchased in bulk with real money. The shop offers bundles of currencies, resources, and even Guardians as well, which it will continually remind you of as you travel through the menus.All of these currencies are used to buy resources that fuel the game's various systems, which border from lengthy to gratuitously over-complicated. Take Motes, the resources used to level up Guardians. Motes come in five colors, one for each of the four classes and a fifth that can be used for any class. They also come in three varieties: Minor, which can only be used for Guardians at levels 1-20, Major for Guardians at levels 21-50, and Superior for Guardians at levels 51-100. That's different types of an item that is crucial to your progress. Also, every 10 levels, you also need to increase your Guardian's ""rank,"" which requires extra items called Gems, which, again, come in both color-coded and generic versions. Oh, and you'll need Books to level up each Guardian's individual skills, and there are six different types of Books to collect as well.All of these convoluted systems create a situation where progress is halted until the in-game shop adds the resources I need to continue. For example: my main party is Tron, Elsa, and Maui. Tron and Elsa are both Ranged Guardians, but at levels 26 and 25, respectively, I can't power them up, as I only have Minor Ranged Motes. Maui, meanwhile, is stuck at level 30 while I search for two more Tier 1 Sapphires in order to increase his rank to four. It's maddening, even more so when I think about how awesome the core idea of Mirrorverse is, and it makes me want to play something else.Energy--a classic mobile game trope where you can play a finite number of missions until you're forced wait a certain amount of time to play again, or pay up to hasten the process--also makes an appearance, but I was able to gain more energy than the counter suggested, so the mechanic's normally restrictive nature wasn't as apparent. At one point my energy meter read that I had 84 energy out of 40 after leveling up my account; while I was happy for the overflow, eventually it dwindled and I was back to the waiting game.I could go on and on, but Mirrorverse is stuffed with predatory tactics like this. They shred any remaining desire to further explore what is truly a bold and unique take on the Disney universe, which is a real shame. I'd hoped these Guardian versions of the Disney characters I'd grown up with would get more time to shine and show off their new abilities. Instead, I got buried in resources and currencies, which relegated these amazing heroes to posing on the menu screens, and the result is a big disappointment. I'm looking into the Mirrorverse, but I don't like the reflection."
1696,Shelter 2,6.0,1,"Shelter wasn't necessarily a waste so much as a wonderful idea that felt hamstrung by playing it safe. You played as a mother badger just trying to feed her kids and keep them alive through a host of natural dangers. The game's problems were its linearity and short length. There was no room for improvisation or exploration in Shelter. It was the Disney World on-rails version of what it was like to be prey in a world full of predators. And yet, it's an idea we don't see enough of, especially in the wake of something like Goat Simulator, which aims for humor rather than the simple, silent drama that is nature doing its thing. In addition, Shelter had a unique art style, that looked like the whole thing took place on a quilt that someone built a papercraft forest on, while gentle string instruments provided the score. It had a National Geographic Presents: Tearaway vibe that caught the eyes and ears. It was an idea that had room to grow. Shelter 2 would seem to have everything that the first game needed to be something special. The art design and musical motifs set by the first game remain the same. However, Shelter 2 has you playing as a lynx, which places you smack dab in the middle of the food chain, meaning you can be both predator or prey at any given moment. After the game's intro, where a mother lynx gives birth to four adorable cubs, instead of being blatantly urged on down a grassy corridor, you're set loose on a huge, forested open world to hunt for food to bring back to your mewling brood until they're grown enough to follow you out. It's still a simple, functional set of mechanics powering the game. One button runs, as long as you have the stamina to do so; one button bites and roars to call your brood to you; and one button allows you to sniff the air and see prey highlighted in red in front of you if you hold it, and allows you to eat and drink if you just tap it. If you do break into a sprint, there's a button that allows you to leap. There's a map that works in an abstract sense, where blank space fills out with a sort of aboriginal representation of the terrain as you travel. Life as a lynx primarily involves stalking prey and making sure all your cubs stay fed, Periodic title cards, representing this game's stages, come up over time explaining the lifecycle of your brood from clumsy cubs to lithe, confident teenagers who chase down prey on their own during your journey. Finally, your fully grown progeny splits entirely from you, their mother, leaving you to return to the original den on your own. Despite the open world, there's really only one other thing to do besides eat in this game, and that's follow the marks in your sniffing mode, telling you where the next area is, meaning once again, Shelter is a walking and eating simulator, with very little to break the cycle. You can pick which direction you can start out in, but all it does is bring you through the same areas in a different direction. The new challenges come mostly from your food. Unlike the first game, your prey is very much alive, and it is literally fast food. There's no targeting button. There's no button allowing your lynx to stalk through underbrush, though the game will inconsistently do it for you if you get close enough, and if there are bushes in the terrain, you can use them for stealth as well. Most of the time, however, you're just breaking into a sprint, and hoping your meal doesn't outrun you or take a sudden, sharp left turn to where you can't track them. Bigger prey like deer show themselves early on, and smaller animals involve just taking a swipe as you get close; bigger animals require a full on leaping takedown, which is probably the most fun part of the game, but it happens infrequently. The placement of prey appears to be randomized each playthrough, meaning the frozen lake where the deer are drinking in one playthrough may be a barren, foodless waste of time the next. Therein lies most of the tension in Shelter 2. The open world allows the mother and her brood to traverse the landscape in whatever pattern they wish, and while it means there's plenty of room to chase around prey and explore, it also means long stretches where there's no prey at all, where all you can really do is hope that the kids hold out until their next meal. This is never under your control. You can tell when hunger's starting to set in by how whiny the cubs start to get--and the whine when one of them finally collapses from starvation is a heartbreaking one--but there's no surefire way to really rectify that situation because you never know what's over the next ridge. It could be a nest of delicious, life-sustaining rabbits. It could be absolutely nothing, meaning you've wasted precious stamina you'll need to chase down actual food when it shows up. The rest of the tension comes later, when you hear the howling of wolves in the distance, which means it's time to run like hell for higher ground. Without fail, I've lost at least one cub every time I've reached the wolves, and yet each time, I've never seen exactly which wolves took it down. I can't tell if that's more frightening or not. Shelter 2 places you smack dab in the middle of the food chain, meaning you can be both predator or prey at any given moment. None of this is particularly bad, but it's also painfully simple. There's a cycle of seasons and time in the game, so when the ground and trees turn white and the waters freeze, my instinct is to find actual shelter for the pack, not realizing that that's an easy way to starve to death, since leaving the initial area usually involves a 10-minute push back to the starting point. When my prey ran off into the forest, my response was to try climbing into the trees to pounce from above. Also not an option. There's a not-really-explained mechanic when you've killed an animal that appears to allow you to cover up the remains, which I figured would come into play later to prevent the wolves from tracking the rest of my pack, but sure enough, they found me, a few minutes later, despite this. The original Shelter's problems have not been fixed. In giving us a far more complex but familiar creature, Shelter's ambitions have grown, but the execution has not grown with them. This big, beautiful open world that's been created is prime to do something with a sandbox besides cramming it with minigames, but it’s never taken advantage of. And just like the first game, it's over right as it feels like it begins, a shade over an hour total from beginning to end, though with no poetic post-script this time to dull the disappointment. And so, we're left with a game that woefully undercooks its concept, a partial success in that nothing that the game does is particularly bad, but for a concept that has always felt like a no-brainer, “why didn't somebody think of that before” situation, the fact that it doesn't do some fairly obviously things to make the game earn its price tag is disheartening. Shelter, as a series, has the right spirit, the right ideas, and it is once again hamstrung by its inability to go the extra, needed mile to do them justice.  "
431,Disc Room,8.0,2,"There are times in life where it feels like no matter what you do, something is waiting to ruin your day. Obstacles that come from all directions, trying to take you down when you're just trying your best to make it to the next day. Perhaps they're big, foreboding, and scary. Maybe there are lots of little things that can harm you just as easily. Something might seemingly come out of nowhere and just wreck your entire being. That's the vibe of the year 2020 Disc Room, a ball of anxious energy in the form of a 2D action game. But as nerve-racking as that sounds, Disc Room is also a game that will eventually encourage you to come to terms with frequent failure, learning instead to cherish the small successes that help you push forward.A giant disc-shaped object has appeared over Jupiter, or so Disc Room's introductory text tells you, and as a charming little space person your goal is to explore what is revealed to be a labyrinth filled with numerous deadly rooms. Each room houses a unique trial involving copious spinning buzzsaws threatening to cut right through you, something that will happen more times than you'll be able to keep track of.It's a twitch-action game that focuses solely on the most heart-pounding element of bullet-hell shoot-em-up games: trying to avoid a ridiculous number of projectiles. Disc Room is concentrated on difficulty and pushing you into panicked situations, featuring a creative variety of aggressive enemy discs. Each exhibits particular behaviors, but none follow a predetermined course, making even the relatively simple stages dangerously unpredictable and challenging every time. Disc Room's reality is one where you're trapped in a room with over a dozen bouncing, fatal blades, where dark electro thumps non-stop, and where death can occur in less than a second.Most of the game's challenges, which allow you to proceed through the labyrinth upon completion, ask you to avoid death for at least a set amount of time. But it's tough going. Surviving for 10 seconds before dying is usually a good effort worthy of forward progress; 20 seconds is a remarkable achievement deserving of the game's equivalent of a gold star. You will also fail to reach these milestones again and again. You will frequently get minced into a little puddle of cartoonish gore before you can take stock of the situation, and you'll leap out of your chair and shout when you finally manage to hit that tenth second after failing to break nine for so long. These seemingly trivial feats feel more rewarding because of the sheer difficulty of avoiding death. But Disc Room also manages to create some value and a sense of accomplishment around your deaths, too. You'll quickly discover that dying to certain enemies will reward you with unique abilities to help you stay alive (dashing, slowing, and cloning, among others). On top of that, another key to unlocking more routes through the map is dying to each of the game's many varieties of discs. You can be terrible at a certain stage, but Disc Room will often have alternative avenues to help you progress as you continue to hone your skills.The excitement of near-misses, the struggle of survival, and making sure your causes of death are comprehensive, are all enough to propel you through the first hour or so, with changes in biomes later mixing up the conditions for counting up the clock. For example, some stages require you to stay within a particular area or collect golden orbs to add seconds to the timer. But more intriguing is the puzzle layer of Disc Room that eventually reveals itself. Certain rooms will require a mix of lateral thinking and creative use of abilities to complete objectives. Attempting to uncover more discs to die from turns into a more perplexing challenge later on. On a couple of occasions, you're given cryptic objectives to try and decipher for yourself (e.g., ????? the ?????), providing a few pleasing avenues for brain-twisting eureka moments.But Disc Room is still a twitch game first and foremost, one that demands intense focus, split-second reactions, and deft maneuvers. The game's user experience caters to this perfectly--restarting after death is instantaneous, and teleporting to the other side of the labyrinth to begin butting your head against a different challenge for a while takes seconds. It's a rapid-fire grinder of action-packed movement, where 30 seconds of white-knuckle gameplay can feel like an hour and achievement is tough to reach but all the more fulfilling for it. The minimal time investment and the fact that another run will only take seconds of your time drives you to keep respawning and trying to best your last attempt, again and again. What's more, a persistent leaderboard displaying the best times from the developers and your friends also pushes you further if you're prone to a resolute competitive streak--former GameSpot editor Peter Brown inadvertently motivated me to spend far more time in certain stages long after I had achieved all the objectives.Graciously, Disc Room also offers several difficulty adjustments that allow you to alter the speed of enemies, hazards, and other assists, with the game's objectives changing to suit. On the flip side, once you've made it through the initial set of trials and rolled the credits, a second, more difficult labyrinth of stages is unlocked. While stage conditions remain, the game's puzzle elements are mostly gone in favor of pure survival under even more demanding conditions--even 10 seconds of life is a significant achievement here, and making your way through Hard Mode continues to provide new doses of the energetic feeling you get from winning hard-fought battles.But you never really ""win""' Disc Room. You just survive it adequately enough to move onto the next thing. The light, mysterious plot has a weird but worthwhile end, but the real reward that Disc Room gives you is learning how to appreciate your own small achievements. The game is fraught with dangers and failure, but it frames the handful of seconds you are able to hang on as something exciting, something to be proud of. Disc Room helps you feed on those tiny bursts of success, in addition to providing success in failure, to keep you moving and pushing through all its trials. Maybe we could all learn something from these... rooms full of discs. Like all great twitch-action games, Disc Room is at once exciting and stressful, challenging and fulfilling, and its spinning saw blades can seep into your everyday thoughts. But moreover, Disc Room feels like a pleasantly positive take on difficulty-first games--you didn't die after 10 measly seconds, you managed to survive for 10 whole seconds. And that's good enough for Disc Room. Thanks, Disc Room."
4595,The Incredible Hulk (2008),4.0,0,"  From a blind man's perspective, the PC version of The Incredible Hulk is a mirror image of its Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 counterparts. You control the giant green monster in a free-roaming, fully destructible version of New York City. The repetitive missions and devil-may-care structure make the transition intact, letting you wreak havoc on the streets if you feel like shirking your duty to save the city. Though the core mechanics are identical, what little fun that could be had by mindlessly terrorizing the people of New York has been lost in translation. The rudimentary graphics and mostly empty streets eradicate even the simple joys of causing massive chaos. By emulating the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions instead of the far superior Xbox 360 and PS3 versions, The Incredible Hulk on the PC loses what little charm there was in mercilessly destroying a city. This abject mess should be avoided by even the most diehard comic-book fans.     The story shows Hulk's evolution from local monster who everyone wants out of their precious city to the lesser-of-two-evils abnormality who saves New York from an even greater threat. Half of the cutscenes are told through static screens featuring just a tape recorder and Edward Norton's tired voice, whereas the other half are poorly rendered cinematics that show barely recognizable versions of the stars from the movie. It's hard to get immersed in this tale of alienation and redemption when the actors sound so disinterested in the proceedings.         The visuals in Hulk are absolutely atrocious. The comically archaic draw-in and pop-up from the other versions are even more pronounced here, hindering not only your visibility but your fun as well. Though textures are more detailed than in the lower resolution Wii version, the same abhorrent fog is ever-present. When you climb a building and look at the city beneath you, there is nothing but a thick wall of gray engulfing everything. It's often impossible to judge how far you must jump to land on the next building because you can't see it, which saps the fun of bounding around the city. When you're walking at ground level, people and cars will pop into view right in front of you and mysteriously disappear when they leave your sight. There is also a lot of clipping going on. You can toss cars straight through buildings, and you'll see Hulk's arm go clean through the backside of enemies, causing no damage. At other times, you'll reach out to grab an object that lies in front of you and it will vanish right before your eyes.     The thriving city that made the other versions fun in short bursts seem to have been overrun by a life-ending plague here. Streets are often completely empty. Where an abundance of cars and people once fled in terror, there are now only a few people and the occasional car lining the streets. The idea of rampaging around a virtual New York City is enticing, but when the population seems to have disappeared, it loses some of its appeal. It's boring destroying a city if no one even cares.     At the very least, The Incredible Hulk controls competently. Jumping around the city and smashing objects is fairly simple to pull off, though it's far easier to crush your foes with a game controller than the keyboard and mouse combo. It's satisfying throwing your weight around and bullying the general population, but things get a little tricky when you want to target specific opponents. You can lock on to enemies with the push of a button, but it takes a second to register and has a tendency to slip off when you start moving around.         The story missions aren't loaded with variety, but there are some minigames and statistics-based feats to add a surprising amount of replay value if you somehow get sucked in. There are a number of unlockable Hulk skins to strive for, and you can earn more-powerful versions of your moves along the way. It is rather shocking that not only can you knock down famous New York landmarks, but that you're also actually rewarded for doing so. It's darkly satisfying to destroy Stark Tower or the Empire State Building; it's just unfortunate that the city doesn't react when you raze these structures. Hearing Tony Stark shouting an angry threat at the beast that toppled his home would have given some weight to these unforgivable destructions. Strangely, the PC version is missing a few landmarks. For instance, the Bear Stearns Building is physically located in the game, but it isn't listed by name, and you won't be rewarded with a Landmark token when it's torn down. All told, there are 35 landmarks in the PC version and 50 on the Xbox 360 and PS3.     The PC version of The Incredible Hulk is awful. What little fun that could be had in the other versions of this game has been destroyed here, only to be replaced with glitchy graphics that won't even let you see the city and a desolate city that somehow makes destruction boring. It's bewildering that the developers ported the inferior PS2 and Wii versions instead of the far more satisfying PS3 and X360 versions. Stay far away from this game.    "
3510,Tales of Monkey Island,8.0,2,"  The beloved adventure game franchise Monkey Island set sail on a new episodic journey last year on the PC and has recently come into port on the PlayStation 3. The five episodes of Tales of Monkey Island (downloadable as a bundle on PlayStation Network) chronicle the further adventures of Guybrush Threepwood--Mighty Pirate--as he pursues his often-imperiled wife, Elaine, and tries to vanquish his nemesis, LeChuck. Yet this tale is no heroic cliche, and it takes some amusing twists and unconventional turns. The relationships between lead characters are the engaging heart of the story, while the supporting cast and wacky environments provide ample opportunity for humor. This is a funny game, and though there are some lulls in the otherwise lively pace, the clever puzzles and the playful ways you have to go about solving them will keep you entertained for the duration. Tales of Monkey Island is a lengthy adventure that's easy to enjoy and easy on your wallet, as well as sure to please both newcomers and veteran insult swordfighters alike.        The first episode, Launch of the Screaming Narwhal, starts off where you might expect an adventure game to end, with you (as Guybrush) poised to deal the killing blow to LeChuck and rescue Elaine. Naturally, things don't quite work out as planned, and this sets the tone for the adventure to come. Tales of Monkey Island doesn't stick to predictable conventions, and it doesn't resort to merely flipping these conventions on their heads. It puts a whole different spin on things, creating adventurous and refreshingly odd situations. Yet the game doesn't get bogged down in weirdness or whimsy and continues at a good clip from episode to episode. The story moves nicely among brisk action sequences, thoughtful puzzles, and expository cutscenes. Though there is occasional downtime, and the first episode feels a bit like taxiing out of the harbor, Tales of Monkey Island cuts through the water at a good pace, keeping you interested and amused throughout the 15-to 20-hour adventure.     Yet it's not just the strange situations you find yourself in that make the game so engaging, but the people that populate this whimsical Caribbean. The lead characters are clear standouts because they have fleshed-out personalities and interesting relationships. Guybrush is a goofy hero who would just as soon chew gum stuck on a window ledge as pull out his sword, and it's impressive that his well-meaning-yet-somewhat-bungling heroism shtick never gets old. Elaine is much more on the ball, and her spirited independence and occasional exasperation with her husband are sweetly counterbalanced by her steadfast love for him. The evolution of Guybrush's relationship with Morgan LeFlay from The Siege of Spinner Cay (Ep. 2) through Rise of the Pirate God (Ep. 5) is another emotional (and comical) high point, and LeChuck's personality overhaul is a clever inversion of his traditionally evil role. The superb voice acting and great dialogue bring these and other characters to life remarkably well. Although the lead characters are definitely more interesting, even the assorted pirates, brigands, and lawyers you come across have a spark of personality.      Guybrush Threepwood is a guy who gets things done with brains over brawn (most of the time), and there are a lot of items to pick up and puzzles to work out across the five episodes. Though you'll occasionally use a sword to chop things or a bomb to blow things up, most of the other items and actions stick to the humorous and eccentric vibe. Some puzzles rely on inventory you picked up in earlier adventures (perhaps even an earlier episode), while many have their own self-contained set of objects. For example, at one point, you need to gather objects for a spell by deciphering a riddle and then use your wits and your inventory to acquire the right ingredients. Other puzzles rely on dialogue, like Guybrush's attempt to help a lonely creature woo its mate using only a handful of lines from a travel phrasebook. Some puzzles combine both items and dialogue, like Guybrush's courtroom foray in The Trial and Execution of Guybrush Threepwood (Ep. 4).        Throughout the course of five episodes, you travel to many different parts of the Caribbean (and beyond!). You make first landfall in a small town with a pirate court, an exclusive nightclub, a mad scientist's house, and the Blow Me Down Glassworks. While this first episode feels a bit slow compared to subsequent episodes, you soon venture out into (and under) the sea, visiting a number of other islands, including the seat of government for an underwater society. And the title of episode three, Lair of the Leviathan, gives you a pretty big clue as to its unique setting. It's fun to travel through the quirky, colorful environments, and revisiting places you've been to in previous episodes gives a nice sense of continuity. The cartoony visual style contributes to the game's lighthearted mood, though you will notice some visual oddities from time to time. And there is some frame rate slowdown during action-heavy scenes or when Guybrush is running around. The audio also suffers occasional hitches, but for the most part, the sound effects and music do a good job of matching the action and setting the mood.     Tales of Monkey Island harks back to the heyday of adventure gaming with a great story, engaging characters, and a lot of entertaining puzzles. Though the solutions generally aren't as tough as their predecessors were, you'll still feel a rewarding sense of satisfaction as you think your way through this game. Infrequent performance hitches and occasionally slow pacing are minor issues compared to the hours of humor, intrigue, romance, and insult swordfighting you get for the remarkably low price of $19.99. If you've got a hankering for adventure, then get your hands (or hooks) on Tales of Monkey Island.  "
946,Attack on Titan 2,8.0,2,"Far from being a mere video game adaptation of the anime, Attack on Titan 2 stands strongly as a character-driven action-RPG in its own right, with rewarding combat that feels fluid and fast and a story that's equal parts charming and shocking. While it shares many similarities with the first game in the series, Attack on Titan: Wings of Freedom, the sequel feels like a better package overall with a cleaner visual style and tighter combat. Despite its story taking some time to really dig its anchors in, it gets there and then some, entrancing you all the way until the closing of the final chapter.Based on the second season of the popular anime series, the story puts you at the center of the conflict between humanity and Titans--a race of giant, people-eating humanoids that one day appeared out of thin air, wiping out a large percentage of the population. Forced to seek a new life behind three huge walls built to keep the Titans out, humanity tried to rebuild, but the Titans managed to find a way through. Faced with extinction, it's up to you and the rest of the military to stop them.After creating a character--who, if you choose a woman, will still be weirdly referred to as ""our man"" by the game's narrator--the game opens with you joining the military cadets and becoming a part of the 104th Cadet Corps. The first few hours cover the same ground as Wings of Freedom, putting you through military training and effectively re-living the events of the first game, albeit in a more condensed setting. Also, each character is voiced in Japanese, so you'll rely on subtitles to keep on top of things.The plot closely follows the anime, so fans are already familiar with what's going on. But it's a story that will pull you in, hard, though not without its fair share of melodrama. While much of the early game feels a little dragged down by some excessive exposition, you come to appreciate those sequences later on, particularly as characters you grow to like face death in shocking ways. Not that the game is overly violent--although the Bloodborne-esque spatter from killing a Titan is pretty messy--it's more that the characters grow on you over time. Watching them struggle through the Titan invasion becomes less of a drudge and more an emotional rollercoaster.The game is made up of numerous large combat areas and some smaller, peaceful hubs where you can go about your daily life: upgrading weapons, buying materials, and maintaining friendships that grant you different equippable skills that can upgrade your stats. While not all that interesting visually, the hub areas serve as a good bookend between each battle, as well as a chance to debrief with the other characters about the last mission and your next moves.The larger, more-open combat zones, which vary from green valleys and large towns to snowy, abandoned villages and giant forests, are far more interesting to move through. A big part of what makes the movement so vital and exciting is your omni-directional mobility gear, or ODM for short. The ODM gear fires anchors into a distant object like a house, a tree or even a Titan, and with the help of two side-loaded gas canisters, thrusts you along the ground and up into the air. It can get a little janky; sometimes you’ll catch the underside of a roof or hit a cliff face that’ll halt your momentum. But more often than not, gliding through buildings or between giant trees feels effortlessly satisfying.Similarly great is the combat, which manages to feel faster and better paced than it did in Wings of Freedom. Titans can only be taken down by slicing out the nape of their necks. You have to fire your anchors into any one of five spots on a Titan you can lock onto, circle around it in mid-air, and then launch at it, swinging your blades wildly. It can feel a little clumsy at first, but within an hour I was dodging attacks in the air and flinging between Titans like it was nothing. The rapid switching of targets and close calls while maneuvering between enemies during a fight never loses its allure, only getting more intense as the story builds.The Titans themselves are the true stars here. With their ridiculous grins, ambling movements and saggy butts, they look amazingly creepy. On higher difficulty levels, the Titans become faster and more aggressive. Their limbs flail impishly as they freely counter your attacks, flick off ODM anchors like they're swatting flies, and pick fellow Scouts out of the air. Moments like this amp up the intensity tenfold, especially when you're caught between responding to an urgent request for help or going to the aid of someone who's been grabbed by a Titan. It's hard not to feel the pressure in the moment, and it's great.Despite its slow start, Attack on Titan 2 offers exciting gameplay along with a deep and intriguing plot that, melodrama aside, tugs on the heart strings. It's well-paced and offers some impressive spaces to move through. The unique combination of the movement and combat mechanics combines with a gripping story to make Attack on Titan 2 one of the more surprising releases of the year."
3154,The Sims 3,6.0,1,"  When adapting a big game to a handheld system, how much can be stripped away before the game loses its identity? The Sims 3 on the 3DS tries valiantly to retain the series' absorbing life management, serving up some of the easygoing dollhouse joy that Sims addicts have come to crave. Yet while the superficial fun is retained, the loss of certain features and the restructuring of others make The Sims 3 more predictable and hollow than it might have been. It's still entertaining to watch your sim interact with others, gesticulating wildly while telling a joke. But the delicate balance of mundane activities versus social ones has been upset, so you spend more time repairing television sets and less time going out for a night on the town. Both Sims fans and newcomers will initially take to this portable people farm. All too soon, however, the fun transforms into something far more insidious: tedium.        There is some fun to be had here, as franchise fans would rightfully expect. Unplanned events are possibly the most enjoyable ones. For instance, your wannabe chef might start a fire while cooking up some mac and cheese. The stove erupts in flames, your sim goes into hysterics, and you can either try to get your sim to handle it himself or have him call the fire department. (Or, if you have a fire alarm installed, firefighters will come automatically.) If you'd rather keep things less dramatic, you can play your guitar for tips, which not only earns you simoleans, but also improves your guitar skill. And if you don't want to play Mr. Nice Guy, why not pick a fight with another sim? The resulting cartoonish scuffle is a hoot to watch and makes it tempting to make more enemies than friends.      The superficial joys provide a few hours of entertainment, but they are sadly undercut by the frustrations that soon set in--most of them a result of how the game has stripped away elements of its big brother on the PC. For example, appliances break far too often, so your shower or sink will spew water everywhere, forcing you to repair it and mop up the spills. Yet unlike in other versions of the game, you can't hire a maid and call a repairman. Thus, you waste time dealing with puddles when you'd rather head to the bookstore. (There are two different town hubs to visit in addition to your own lot.) The game may indicate that your handy sim wants to improve his repair skill within a certain time period, but you have to wait for something to break because you can't tinker with electronics as you might in other versions.         Digging further reveals other flaws. Socializing has always been an important aspect of the Sims experience, and visitors are constantly ringing your bell or luring you into conversation. Hearing your digital acquaintances chat in the series' signature Simlish language will tickle your fancy, though conversation options aren't as rich as you might like. Nonetheless, the exaggerated animations instill social interactions with classic Sims charm. Yet, you might spend countless in-game days chatting it up with your neighbors, only to discover that your relationship meters have barely moved. It's unclear if the meters' reluctance to move is a design choice or a bug, though there are certainly some obvious bugs to be found. (For example, you may not be able to repair a radio, even though you should be.) In any case, you need to put a lot of time and effort into relationships to reap the rewards. It's unfortunate that while you can develop a romance and ultimately enjoy multi-sim households, you cannot have children. There are no youngsters in The Sims 3, nor is there aging. Thus, other wonderful elements of the series, such as genetics, have also been excised.      The building and buying aspects have fortunately not been removed, though they were streamlined in sensible ways. You can't get too carried away with decking out your lot; there is no terraforming, for example. But there are still lots of goodies to buy for your place (sofas, ovens, showers, and so on), as well as ways to customize and add to your abode (wallpaper, carpet, flower beds, and what have you). The interface works well enough in all modes of play. You order your sim and place objects using the touch screen; the top screen stays focused on your sim while in live mode, and it allows you to scroll around in other modes. The touch screen is cluttered, so you may not always select the object or sim you want to interact with on the first tap. The top-down view can also make certain activities, like applying your new paint scheme, a bit of a chore. But overall, Sims enthusiasts and newcomers alike will take to the interface relatively quickly.      "
3011,Captain America: Super Soldier,6.0,1,"    Batman: Arkham Asylum, and though technical inconsistencies prevent Captain America from reaching the same lofty heights, it's eminently satisfying to bash toughs in the head with your patriotic fists. Agility is your strongest ally. Enemies flash before they attack, and if your reflexes are sharp, you can dive out of the way or let loose a devastating counterattack. Captain America is as lithe as a Romanian gymnast, and there's intrinsic appeal in just leaping around the battlefield. You can smoothly jump around and even  your many attackers, and harnessing that mesmerizing speed makes dispatching foes in one long combo a thrilling endeavor.        Your feet and fists both make quick work of the baddies that surround you, but it's the dynamic shield that brings much-needed diversity into the mix. Long-range attackers have no qualms peppering you with bullets while their melee-focused comrades close in around you, though their puny assassination attempts are laughable when you're holding your trusty shield. Easy-to-grasp visual cues clue you in on an imminent strike, and tapping block right before it pierces your flesh sends wayward bullets careening right back to the dastardly sniper. When combat is running smoothly, it's an exciting endeavor that keeps you glued to the screen. But technical problems hamper this carefree action. A stuttering frame rate is the most glaring issue, causing the most chaotic moments to move in sluggish fits. Also, your counter button may not register at inopportune moments, and unexpected quick-time events are easy to fail when you're mashing away on the attack button.      Outside of combat, there are paint-by-numbers platforming sections, which convey that you are, in fact, a super hero, though the fun Captain America must be having is far from contagious. These jumping challenges pay homage to the Uncharted series, replacing the skill of successful leaping with gravity-defying spectacle. You can only jump at specified points, and every subsequent leap ensures you grab directly onto the next hold without any fear of falling. Granted, the high flying does look really good. Cap swings from poles, runs along walls, and shimmies up ledges without a care in the world. But it would have been a lot more empowering if you had more control over these actions.        The final pillar holding this adventure aloft is the exploration. Levels comprise interconnected corridors that form one giant whole. It's not quite an open world because you need to continue on a preset path most of the time, but there are opportunities to backtrack. Although the freedom of being able to explore is satisfying, it's too easy to get lost. You can call up a map at any time, but it's poorly detailed, which means you often have to rely on guesswork to get to your next objective. Along the way, there are plenty of collectibles to sniff out. Ceramic eggs and dossier folders are sprinkled liberally across the grounds, and though it doesn't make much sense that important information would be left behind a bushel of explosive barrels, it is fun to search every inch to nab them all. Plus, you gain experience points with each secured treasure, which unlocks more attacks in your repertoire. There are also propaganda films (boring), diary entries (baffling), and schematic blueprints (helpful), so there's plenty of reason to traipse over every bit of ground to see what secrets lay hidden there.      The individual elements in Super Soldier aren't that impressive. Punishment-free platforming, a dull story, and homogenized visuals make you feel like a super zero, and the tame boss fights fail to inject much excitement into your adventure. But combat is the focus in the Captain's latest game, and that's where its strength lies. Diving gracefully around the battlefield is smooth and satisfying, and there's a sadistic joy in finishing off foes with a powered-up strike to the noggin. There's little in Super Soldier you haven't seen before, but the action manages to stay fun throughout the eight-hour adventure. And there are a few challenge rooms (with an emphasis on combat) to take part in when you wrap up the tale. Predictability isn't always a bad thing. Captain America: Super Soldier shakes free of its ho-hum trappings to deliver an action-packed adventure that manages to consistently entertain.   "
3174,The 3rd Birthday,6.0,1,"   Parasite Eve as an NYPD cop who waged turn-based battle against mitochondrial creatures that threatened Manhattan. It's been 11 years since the last Parasite Eve game was released, though, so even many who played them may have fuzzy memories of Aya's earlier adventures. But that's just as well because Aya begins The 3rd Birthday with no memory of her previous life, and both the story and the gameplay bear so little connection to the Parasite Eve games that no knowledge of them is needed to jump into this adventure.      The 3rd Birthday begins in a near-future New York that has been ravaged by creatures called Twisted. Aya Brea has been recruited by the Counter Twisted Investigation team. Her role is to use a device called the overdive system, which sends her psyche into the past. Aya's awareness is sent back to the times and places of particular Twisted attacks, where she can possess soldiers, changing the outcome of these past battles to alter the present. What starts out as a relatively straightforward tale of sci-fi action becomes increasingly outlandish, convoluted, and metaphysical. Those who like their narratives to have plots that can be easily followed and understood will be left frustrated by The 3rd Birthday's tale. Others will appreciate the way its story abandons any attempt to make literal sense in favor of more poetic explorations of themes like existence, identity, and memory, even if the stilted dialogue often sounds like something out of a bad soap opera.     However, even those who find the plot's particulars too esoteric will enjoy watching it be told. The high production values of the cutscenes make the Twisted's devastating attacks on New York City unsettling. The voice cast does as well as can be expected with the unnatural dialogue, and the score shifts adeptly between haunting and thrilling to suit the action. The levels are varied and attractive; your missions take you into the backstage area at a popular club, through a damaged skyscraper, and into an ethereal realm where bodies and urban elements like subway cars float alongside the monstrous Twisted queen. The journey ultimately culminates in a climactic battle that makes good use of a famous New York City location.       Unfortunately, the character around whom this story revolves is a frustrating one. A tale like this needs a strong hero at its center, and Aya comes across as far too weak to support the story. Aya's psyche is understandably troubled due to her amnesia and the fragments of memory that haunt her dreams, but she comes across as overly demure and weak willed rather than fragile and vulnerable. During cutscenes, she often responds to people not with words but with a tentative whimper, and when one character talks about her appearance in ways that are inappropriate and downright creepy, Aya's responses make it seem like she finds this treatment perfectly normal. Aya is one-part action hero, one-part submissive sex object (a facet that's reinforced by some of the revealing and hilariously impractical outfits you can unlock), and it's a combination that doesn't work in the game's favor. Aya's weakness also intrudes on the gameplay, where the noises she makes when she gets hit are less like those of a wounded woman and more like those of a petulant little girl who has been told she can't have any more candy.     All of the combat in The 3rd Birthday involves guns, but this isn't a shooter. With most weapons, you can lock on to targets automatically, so defeating enemies is often a matter of holding down the lock-on button and then pressing or tapping the fire button. The trick isn't hitting them so much as it is staying alive long enough to do enough damage to kill them. It's not just the many nasty, tentacled varieties of Twisted and other creatures you encounter that make surviving tricky; it's also the rigid controls. You move Aya in third person, and her casual jogging speed doesn't befit the life-and-death situations in which she finds herself, nor is it sufficient for dodging enemy projectiles and keeping you away from danger. Taking cover behind barricades shields you from some attacks and slowly restores your health, but most attacks destroy these barricades quickly, so you can't rely on cover for long. Aya can perform quick dodge rolls, though performing three in a row leaves her winded and vulnerable to attack. Controlling a character whose slow, limited movements make her extremely vulnerable often thwarts the thrills the gameplay is striving to provide.    The ability to leap from soldier to soldier is Aya's saving grace, and it's essential to survival. Aya can transfer instantly from body to body, so the death of the soldier you possess doesn't necessarily spell death for you. You can use soldiers up and abandon their husks in the final moments of their lives, provided there's another fighter on the field. Hopping around from person to person and from position to position is a fun and flashy mechanic that gives the combat a distinctive feel. This ability also has an offensive component: If you sustain an assault on an enemy for a period of time, a triangle icon will indicate that you can perform an overdive attack, sending your psyche inside it for an instant and doing significant damage. You can more effectively create openings for overdive attacks by directing any nearby soldiers to concentrate their fire at your target for a brief period. To trigger this coordinated assault, which the game calls crossfire, you need to lock on to an enemy without firing for a short while as a gauge fills. Attacking enemies fills up another gauge that, when full, enables you to enter a state called liberation. In liberation, Aya's movements are blindingly swift, and true to the state's name, it makes for a liberating departure from her normally stiff actions. Unfortunately, this state is so short lived that you barely have time to enjoy it before Aya returns to normal.       The 3rd Birthday sometimes succeeds at generating a great deal of tension. In one battle, for instance, the enemy onslaught seems overwhelming and circumstances seem hopeless. Your desperate attempts to survive are exciting, and the tension that builds up is ultimately released in an immensely satisfying way when an armored vehicle arrives, enabling you to take control of its gunner and turn the tide, making short work of the creatures that just shortly before were slaughtering soldiers left and right. It's an exhilarating moment. But often, the tension can boil over into full-blown frustration. For instance, in most situations, a steady stream of reinforcements means that even if the soldier you're currently occupying is in bad shape, surviving long enough will let you leap to another, brand new body with full health (though surviving that long is often easier said than done). But one difficult battle in a location where reinforcements can't reach you can become infuriating. The monsters you face, like many you encounter throughout the game, have a good deal of health that your attacks slowly chip away. They also have attacks that can wipe out all your health with a few hits, and your stiff movements make attempting to evade some of those attacks a frustrating endeavor. You might repeatedly find yourself nearing victory only to fail and then be faced with the prospect of starting the long, slow process of fighting them all over again. This battle, and others like it, highlight the limitations of Aya's movement and can drain all the momentum from the game. Success in these situations brings with it a sense of relief in knowing that a painful step of your journey is over, rather than a rewarding sense of victory.      As you advance from mission to mission, you earn experience and level up, increasing Aya's health and the power of her overdive attack. Additionally, frequent use of a specific type of weapon--handguns, assault rifles, or shotguns, for instance--gives you access to better weapons and weapon components of that type. You can purchase and equip components that improve a weapon's accuracy and capacity, as well as choose between ammo that does more damage but triggers overdive attack opportunities less frequently and ammo with the opposite characteristics. You also collect items called OE chips, which you can equip to grant Aya various benefits, such as increased defense and stronger crossfire attacks. These customization options aren't very deep or involving, but tinkering with Aya's weapons and attributes makes for a pleasant little diversion between missions.       Like its protagonist, The 3rd Birthday is beautiful and troubled, flawed and fascinating and frustrating. In addition, it's short; the irritating difficulty of some sections means that its six episodes may take a while to complete, but that issue aside, the adventure is roughly five hours long. Cheat codes that unlock as you finish the game and accomplish certain tasks let you replay the game with enhanced abilities, though this certainly isn't enough of an incentive to complete the game the whopping 10 times you'd need to unlock one of the cheat codes. The 3rd Birthday has an intriguing story with an annoying heroine and unusual gameplay that makes for an occasionally thrilling experience, which is often undermined by stiff controls and frustrating difficulty. Some will find enduring the flaws a tolerable price to pay to experience Aya Brea's strange journey, but she has some serious growing up to do before her next birthday rolls around.   "
1683,Frozen Cortex,7.0,2,"A pneumatic leg slams into a neon breastplate, dislodging a ball with curious, flattened sides--futuristic-looking in that characteristically impractical sort of way, like a concept car with inaccessible wheel wells. It’s a turnover in favor of Sporting Automata, and one of its robots lumbers into the phosphorescent glow of the end zone, where it spikes the ball and does a few celebratory sit-ups. This is Cortex, an object lesson in a brand of futurism that's surprisingly hard to come by in the world of electronic sports. Its gridiron is littered with extruded geometries and embossed with cosmetic circuitry patterns. Broad-shouldered athlete-simulacra smash into each other like promo animations for the NFL on FOX as their head coach/Matrix operators look on, bottom-lit by monitor glow. It's a wildly speculative vision of what sports could one day be. It’s the kind of thing you used to see a lot more of earlier in the digital era, and a far cry from the current tack of e-sports with its gently iterative shooters and fighting games. Frozen Cortex's other hereditary through-line runs straight back to football. In a planning phase prior to any action, two players simultaneously slip step-by-step instructions to their team of five robots, setting up running routes, passes, blocks, or zone coverage. The goal is to score by reaching the thin strip of the end zone or crossing smaller ""extra point"" tiles strewn across the randomly generated maps. Waypoints can be laid down with simple clicks of the mouse, and a bot will faithfully trace a direct route through them to the end of its line. With a full set of paths and nodes diagrammed out for the five robots, the traditional playmaking X’s and O’s here begin to take on the look of an electrical schematic, and it’s easy to imagine some subsequent Frozen Cortex ‘16 version introducing stutter-step resistors and spin-move inductors, or maybe a ""battery"" symbol for a stiff-arm to the face. A lot of Frozen Cortex’s tactical potency is owed to the fact that it allows players to sketch out and demo their opponent’s game plan exactly as if it were their own. It’s a subtly brilliant little inclusion that opens up the opportunity to tailor-make counters to highly specific plays. Of course, the awareness that your opponent can just as easily construct a 1:1 model for any play you might conjure up ends up bleeding into your strategic subconscious, too. Against a well-versed player, a match of Cortex becomes an exercise in recursion: ""They’ll be expecting the obvious pass--but they’ll also be expecting that I expect that they expect the obvious pass. But then again…"" You can imagine the effect this can have on turn length. Outside of a specialized mode with a thirty-second play clock, players can take as long as they want--days, even--to submit their move. But it’s all well accounted for in Frozen Cortex’s elegant matchmaking system, which allows you to field multiple games simultaneously and even enable email notifications in case your turn comes up while you’re away. While the server population never seems to stretch beyond thirty players at a given time, games are easy enough to come by. The measured, deliberate pace seems to attract a crowd that's more genial than most, if sometimes prone to ""forgetting"" about your match soon after you burn them for a big score. This all means that it only takes a match or two to pick up the fundamentals, which is as long as I can recommend bothering with Frozen Cortex’s single-player mode. With both players’ interpretations of the ensuing play in hand, the game crashes them into each other and films the resulting chaos like Jake Gyllenhaal’s creepy Nightcrawler cameraman, tailing runners with an uncomfortably narrow chase view or leaping sideways to frame the secondary getting burned on a long pass. A quibble, but it’s easy to lose track of a robot during these rare and irregular perspective changes, especially when a given part of the playing field so often looks like any other. Learning to respect the deep ball is the first harsh lesson in the education of a Cortex player. A bot can hurl the rock from one end of the small field clear to the other--as long as there aren’t any tall blocks in the way--and drop it in the end zone to be caught or picked up by a nearby teammate. The longest passes freeze at their apex, ending the turn. This ostensibly allows the defense time to swoop in for an interception, but the effect is like a crystallization of that wonderful moment when an NFL cameraman begins that telltale, frantic sideways pan--the moment anyone watching suddenly realizes that something’s just gone dramatically wrong (or, less often for a Texans fan like me, right) in the backfield. Unlike passes, runs draw out through the full length of a turn. True to real football, they’re the grind-it-out option, leaning on the cumulative effect of bonus point tiles for a win by attrition. Because of the idiosyncratic way that blocking works in Frozen Cortex, stopping the run requires a patient defense and timely risks. If it lapses enough to allow a robot to scamper through to the end zone after hitting a string of extra points, it’s a coup. Two circles around each bot govern all collisions in a game chock full of them: one for blocking and one for tackling. A robot that’s ""first on scene""--that is to say, reaches an area and goes stationary before the opponent does--will block any comers trying to run past its circle on their prescribed routes. But stationary bots will automatically bypass would-be blockers to snuff out ball handlers that enter their larger tackling radius. It's a strategic wrinkle that forgoes the random number generators so endemic to sports games in favor of something more aboveboard and ultimately more intuitive, too. This all means that it only takes a match or two to pick up the fundamentals, which is as long as I can recommend bothering with Frozen Cortex’s single-player mode. There are two main formats: a one-and-done ""Knockout"" mode and a standard single-season league. In league play, the AI provides stiff initial competition, but it quickly fades as you use the perfunctory free agent system to outspend it on new robots with better stats. There’s an overarching text-based narrative involving an investigation into thrown matches, but it goes nowhere fast and rings especially hollow because Frozen Cortex actually allows you to bet against your own team and throw the game without consequences. It's weird to cite a game for trying to go deeper or tell a story. But the futuristic coating that Frozen Cortex paints over its sport works best as a surface treatment. And if you don't cut into it, it looks great. The teams have slick, expressive names like ""Heavy Perspective"" or ""SXT Vision,"" and their logos look like the glyph symbols in Blade that denote secret vampire rave nightclubs. The industrial electronica tracks thrum along as naturally as a pulse. A news ticker drip feeds evocative little blurbs like ""Core 4’ Teams to Meet with WRC and League to Discuss Player Rights."" It's only in the actual exposition that these things end up belabored, as the league's talking heads try to pack an entire personality into each of the tweet-sized messages they send before each match. Maybe that's a mark in favor of replacing the human element in futuristic games like this. If you could only excise all those flimsy, unreliable human bodies, with their proclivities for head trauma and contract renegotiation demands, you'd perhaps reach something purer--sport ascended from the flesh, so to speak. Bigger but more thoughtful. Gladiatorial but safe. With blitzes that play out like chess, with mechanized athletes that can pull any move if you can just hit the right combination of buttons. Some ultimate game where nerd and jock fuse together and assume their final form."
3898,Disney's Herbie: Fully Loaded,5.0,1,"  Herbie: Fully Loaded is a lightweight racing game that's best suited for the youngest and least demanding of players. The smooth 3D graphics are the game's lone bright spot. Otherwise, the driving is too basic, the AI is too dumb, and there are barely enough tracks and play options to occupy more than an hour of someone's time.        The game loosely follows the movie. Players compete against NASCAR drivers on road and oval courses using a supercharged Volkswagen named ""Herbie."" At the end of every race in the story mode, images taken directly from the movie let you know how close you are to winning the championship.     Aside from the story mode, there's also a free race mode and a championship mode. These extra play modes mainly just provide an alternative method of going through the eight different tracks included in the game, since the only option you can change in either mode is the skill level of the CPU opponents. The number of different tracks and play modes is disappointing. The majority of other racing games on the GBA at least let you mirror the included tracks, and some also offer a multiplayer link mode.     Most players will breeze through the story mode and unlock all eight tracks in an hour or less. The hardest part is taking first place on each track, since finishing second or worse bumps you right back out to the menu with a ""game over"" screen. Even with this sadistic outcome as a possibility, it's actually fairly easy to take the checkered flag. Herbie accelerates quickly and will skid cleanly through most turns with a slight tap of the directional pad. If you do happen to smack into the track boundary and stall, it's usually no big deal, because the CPU is so poorly programmed. CPU cars spend more time driving in the dirt than they do in the roadway, and when they are in the road they have a tendency to drive through oil slicks and slam into each other.      Herbie also has a few trick abilities that can be used during the race. They're charming, but they also make the game that much easier. There are four different tricks in all: turbo speed, backward driving, high jump, and tire launcher. In order to use these abilities, you have to collect star items that are situated in the road. Once you collect a star, you can activate the corresponding trick by pressing the L or R button. The most hilarious of these is Herbie's tire launcher, which spits a spare tire out of Herbie's forward-facing trunk toward the opponents up ahead.     The smooth 3D graphics are the game's lone bright spot. Herbie has been captured from a variety of angles, and he's large enough so that his moonroof and #53 are easily recognizable. The texture-mapped courses employ the same ""mode 7""-style 3D that numerous other racing games on the GBA have, but the draw distance and resolution are much better here, to the point that details such as lane markers, trees, and houses are sharp and clearly defined. If you look closely, you'll notice that CPU cars aren't as sharp or detailed as Herbie. This trade-off is totally forgivable though, considering how nice the courses look and how smooth the frame rate is.        Conversely, the audio is nothing special. Apart from a few bump and grind sound effects, the brunt of the soundtrack comes from Herbie's engine, which sounds like a lawn mower, and from a solitary musical loop that plays throughout each race. Although the sound effects and music are sufficient, there's no personality to them. Including a few Lindsay Lohan voice samples would have gone a long way toward pepping things up.     Herbie: Fully Loaded comes across as a missed opportunity. The 3D graphics are a treat, but everything else about the game is underdeveloped or poorly programmed. With a few more courses and play options, and a few AI tweaks here and there, this could've been one of the best racing games ever made for the GBA. As it stands, the game is probably OK for young kids. Anyone that's already mastered the ins and outs of third grade, however, will probably want to play something else.  "
753,Kingdom Hearts III,8.0,2,"The only way to really understand the emotions Dearly Beloved stirs is to have connected with the franchise and its characters; to have followed their journeys over its 17-year history, for better or worse. The nostalgia for and investment in Kingdom Hearts as a franchise is incredibly powerful, so much so that it helped me push through the rougher patches in what is overall an enjoyable, if uneven, third entry in the core series. Kingdom Hearts 3 is preoccupied with fan service to a fault, and it also struggles to stay coherent under the weight of its own convoluted lore. But it's also everything fans love about the series: a thrilling action-RPG that celebrates Disney and Pixar, all the while ensuring themes of friendship, heroism, and pure-hearted goodness shine bright.At times, those themes can be difficult to discern, particularly when the game is intent on telling the grander story of Kingdom Hearts as opposed to the smaller tales centered around Disney's iconic characters or Sora’s innocent idealism. Given it's the concluding chapter in a massive story arc, it can't be faulted for having this fixation, but the execution is frustrating nonetheless. Kingdom Hearts 3 is bogged down in the finer details of its lore, so much so that--for all but the most clued-in fans--it can be difficult to get a sense of what our three main heroes are actually trying to accomplish.At its broadest, the story of Kingdom Hearts 3 involves Sora, Donald, and Goofy preparing for an upcoming war against the forces of darkness by gathering the Guardians of Light. This is oversimplification to its most extreme, but to delve into the finer details would require lengthy explanations of numerous confounding concepts and characters. It is undoubtedly messy, but for fans who have committed to playing all the games and been studious enough to join the dots along the way, it makes sense. For those that aren't as well-versed in Kingdom Hearts, the essentials of the story aren't laid out nearly as clear as they need to be.The bloated state of Kingdom Hearts’ lore is the result of numerous spin-offs and sequels that introduced new characters to explore back- and side-stories. Contained in their own games, these characters had the room to breathe, establish themselves, and have full narrative arcs. However, when united in one game, each is diminished in both characterization and impact. Kingdom Hearts 3 attempts to take all the disparate narrative threads from across its many games--and the characters tied up in them--and weave them together into one concluding story, and the result is incoherent to say the least. It doesn’t help that numerous characters look the same, or that some are time-travelling versions of themselves. Others, meanwhile, are reincarnations that have taken on a new form or exist inside the heart of yet another character. There are also a few that used to have one name, but now have another, but both names are used depending on who is talking about them. Before long all of these characters are elbow to elbow, vying for screen time and pulling the story in so many different directions that it becomes difficult to find its center again. The handful that are critical to the plot inevitably become lost among the many bit-parters that feel like they're in the game as fan service, instead of being meaningful to the story.If Kingdom Hearts 3 had stronger writing it may have been possible to highlight key details and figures for the player to latch onto; a chance to see through the crowd of faces and pick out the ones most important. However, the writing largely makes proceedings even harder to follow. The villains in particular--many of which are members of Organization XIII--spout inane lines that are purposefully vague. Presumably this was to build mystery, but it only serves to muddy motivations and further obscure the crux of the story. Otherwise, they're delivering cheesy dialogue that feels at odds with the sincere melodrama happening around them.At its core, Kingdom Hearts 3 is a heartfelt tale of enduring friendship, and the narrative is at its strongest when it narrows its focus to just thisThis is a shame because, at its core, Kingdom Hearts 3 is a heartfelt tale of enduring friendship, and the narrative is at its strongest when it narrows its focus to just this. Sora, the hero of the series, continues to be plucky and lovably naive. His greatest facets are his strength of heart, his ability to make friends with anyone, and his devotion to them--he is the archetypal wholesome good boy. Joining him once again is Donald Duck, stuffy and prone to outbursts but a trustworthy companion; and Goofy, slightly dimwitted but also the emotional anchor of the group.The endearing trio's adventures through the Disney and Pixar worlds featured in Kingdom Hearts 3, as well as the interactions they have with the characters within them, are a reminder that beneath the tortuous lore are smaller stories that resonate. By keeping the bigger Keyblade Wars story in the periphery and having minimal involvement from all those involved with it, these stories are clearer and more concise. The underlying themes of Kingdom Hearts harmonize with those of Disney's own properties so well that each new world Sora journeys to delivers an impactful moment of storytelling. In Toy Box, Sora helps Woody, Buzz, and the gang find their missing friends, as they also grapple with the idea that they live in a world where Andy doesn't exist. In Arendelle, he meets Anna, who is desperately trying to reconnect with her sister, Queen Elsa, and gets caught up in the family drama. In San Fransokyo, Sora assists Hiro and the Big Hero 6 team as they battle Microbots and find a forgotten friend. Admittedly, some of these stories retread old ground, but whether it's Tangled, Pirates of the Caribbean, Winnie The Pooh, Monsters Inc., or Hercules, experiencing them again through the lens of Kingdom Hearts 3 still packs an emotional punch. It's hard not to get swept up by the exaggerated displays of heroics or earnest reminders that your friends exist in your heart.One of the strengths of Kingdom Hearts 3 is the care and attention it pays to bringing Disney's worlds to life, which, in turn, makes being in them all the more exciting. You get to wander around Andy's bedroom as a diminutive toy version of Sora, scaling his walls and jumping on his toys, before making a trip to the mall. There you visit various toy shops, leaping on top of display units and between shelves as you battle the enemy Heartless. Returning to Kingdom Hearts 2's Twilight Town comes with a wave of nostalgia, as you hang around in the square watching a Mickey Mouse movie projected on a wall or visit the mansion where Namine stood at the window all those years back. Venture to the Pirates of the Caribbean world and the game adopts a striking, realistic visual style, swapping Sora and friends from their usual vibrant visages to a muddier tone in line with the movies' color palette. It then gives you command of your own ship with Jack Sparrow at your side. 100 Acre Wood shifts to the warmer pastels of a storybook aesthetic, as you help Rabbit tend to his garden so that Pooh can get some honey. San Fransokyo makes great use of verticality and Sora's ability to effortlessly run up buildings and glide between rooftops. At night it transforms into a blinding neon cityscape, inviting you to fly between floating blimps and grind rails with Baymax flying in tow. Monsteropolis has you working with Sully and Mike to stop Randal seizing control of Monsters Inc., and all the while Boo adorably potters along next to you.Many of the worlds offer extra gameplay activities to engage with after the story within them is wrapped up. Toy Box puts you in a Final Fantasy XV parody where you're in a mech destroying enemies and chasing high scores. Traverse Town has a cooking mini-game which involves collecting ingredients from across the worlds and then bringing them to Ratatouille's Remy to make meals. Pirates of the Caribbean lets you sail the open sea in search of treasure and do battle with enemy ships, or defend Port Royale in a wave-based mini-game. The amount of gameplay variety in Kingdom Hearts 3 is impressive, and although the extras may be short-term distractions, for those who want to spend more time in their favourite worlds, they're a fun reason to make the return trip.Not all worlds maintain that high bar, however, as some feel either empty or lacking in what they offer. Arendelle's snow-covered terrain, for example, feels quite bland, and the main mission involves climbing a mountain multiple times. Port Royale is an entire location used primarily for an item hunt. Toy Box's mall is devoid of life beyond the toys and enemies--it would have been nice to have people around to make it feel more alive, instead of like an after-hours shopping center. The same can be said of San Fransokyo which, on ground level, feels eerily deserted for a metropolis.The bulk of Kingdom Hearts 3's gameplay, however, is in its sword-swinging, magic-conjuring combat, which feels fast, frenetic, and spectacular in its cinematic flourishes. Its combat mechanics are an evolution of Kingdom Hearts 2's, which themselves have been tweaked and refined in the various spin-off titles. The most noticeable change is in its fluidity; Sora moves between enemies quickly, delivering a barrage of attacks, seamlessly transitioning into casting Fira to set enemies ablaze or Cura to recover health. There's a pleasing forward momentum to all the battles, as you zip around dispatching enemies in quick succession.There are numerous layers on top of the basic combat mechanics which, while not adding a great deal of depth or strategic considerations, make for more exciting skirmishes. Keyblades now come in a number of flavours to match the Disney worlds they're unlocked from. As part of this, they also have Formchanges, which are exactly what they sound like. As you land attack buttons, a meter builds up, and you are eventually given the option to transform your Keyblade into more over-the-top forms, where more powerful attacks and abilities become available. The game shows creative flare in these transformations too; Wheel of Fate, unlocked in the Pirates world, becomes an oversized spear and then the mast of a ship with the flag attached. Happy Gear, found in Monsters Inc., transforms into a set of high-speed claws and then a pair of yo-yos. Hunny Spout morphs into a pair of twin pistols and then a launcher, both firing honey at enemies.The amount of gameplay variety in Kingdom Hearts 3 is impressive ... for those who want to spend more time in their favourite worlds, [mini-games] are a fun reason to make the return triMagic works similarly, with repeated use of a spell eventually making a Grand Magic version available at no additional mana cost. Throughout, Donald and Goofy will call to Sora for a team-up attack. For the former this could be a salvo of colorful fireworks that damage everyone in your vicinity. For the latter you can leap into the sky and throw Goofy at an enemy, with his shield causing an explosion on impact. These are characters that have fought many battles side by side, so having these back and forths are a nice representation of the camaraderie between them and their growth across the series--not to mention they're eye-catching cinematic moments.Feeding into the Disney milieu further are attractions such as tea cups, water rafts, bumper cars, and a rollercoaster that can be summoned to dish out damage. Each one controls differently, either through timed button presses, using the analogue stick to guide their path, or becoming a first-person shooter to pinpoint specific enemies, injecting a different style of combat gameplay into the action at regular intervals. Other Disney characters such as Simba, Stitch, and Ariel can also be called into battle, functioning similarly to Final Fantasy's summons to unleash devastating special attacks. Their inclusion is welcome, in lieu of giving them their own worlds, as some have had in past games. Beyond that there's Flowmotion, which builds a sense of speed by encouraging you to dash into objects in the environment to swing around, or at walls to parkour along. It can be tricky to get a handle of, but once you're able to work these moves into the flow of combat, you build a sense of prowess over the battlefield.Watching battles unfold, you'd be forgiven for thinking that combat is a complicated dance of fingers across buttons, but everything is actually achieved with one or two taps. Kingdom Hearts 3 is simple to play, which works in its favour. It prioritizes spectacle above all else and delivers tremendously. Instead of having to focus too much on what you're pressing and when, you can enjoy the madness unfolding on screen. This is a game that shows off and wows you with dazzling lights, explosive sounds, and high-octane action, and you don't want to miss a second of it. That's not to say it's completely devoid of strategic considerations, but you'll need to play on the harder Proud difficulty level if you want the game to challenge you. Otherwise--barring a few end game bosses--the enemies are pushovers.Another feature that makes its return from Kingdom Hearts of old is the Gummi Ship. Sora and his crew are able to pilot a spaceship as they travel to new worlds, at which point the game becomes a shoot-em-up of sorts. While Gummi Ship segments in the past were on-rails, this time you have full freedom to fly where you please, using wormholes and boost pads to explore quicker. Space is littered with treasures to find, but you'll often have to battle enemies to acquire them. The shooting in the Gummi Ship, while serviceable, isn't satisfying. The combination of lackluster visual and auditory feedback makes it hard to tell whether you're actually doing any damage, and for the most part I found myself absentmindedly holding the fire button down and waiting for things to explode. It is possible to create your own ships and outfit them with more weapons and augmented support abilities, but the fundamental shooting remains unchanged and uninteresting.As the game reaches its conclusion, the balance shifts heavily in favour of non-Disney worlds, where the main story of Kingdom Hearts can play out and resolve itself. Many of the environments this happens in are striking, from a pristine white city to strange modular arenas that can be turned upside down at the whim of an enemy. But in these locales the game trades the heart and whimsy of the worlds up until that point for heavy-handed storytelling that inevitably culminates in battles that are impressive set-pieces but feel cheap and spammy to play. With the finish line in sight, the game disrupts the pace with one arduous boss fight after another--not challenging in any way, just more of slog. The payoff, meanwhile, isn't entirely worth it, as Kingdom Hearts 3 wraps up its story in an incredibly unfulfilling way.But the story of Keyblade wars, time-travelling villains, body-hopping also-rans, and world-ending darkness isn't what I'll remember about Kingdom Hearts 3 or the series as a whole. What sticks with me is the exciting battle against elemental titans with Hercules, taking Rapunzel out into the unfamiliar wide world for the first time, snapping selfies with Winnie the Pooh, and going toe to toe with Davy Jones. In 2002, as Sora, I left Destiny Islands to travel across the universe and make new friends. In 2019 I brought old ones home, and I had so much fun doing it."
990,Tiny Metal,7.0,2,"By and large, this is simply a game where adorably rendered soldiers with little armored vehicles take turns moving across a gridded map to fight their enemies one turn at a time. A unit represents a small squad, and when two units meet, the squads exchange blows while you pray some of your soldiers and vehicles survive the shootout.Though Tiny Metal props up dire circumstances as the backbone of its campaign, it's also a game with a shady arms dealer dressed as a circus clown, so you know it doesn't take itself too seriously at all times. Average soldiers are expressively animated, and every unit type has their own personality, accent, and enthusiasm for destruction. This silliness is at odds with the dialogue-heavy and po-faced cutscenes, yes, but it also grows into the defining attitude of the game as you become more entrenched in combat. That said, don't feel too bad for turning off the in-battle emotes, which quickly grow repetitive.You're given plenty of options to consider during combat, with a range of ground troops and military vehicles that grows steadily from the start, each offering distinct capabilities. Average, run-of-the-mill riflemen can only survive encounters with similar troops, but they're also the best at capturing city buildings and military facilities in pursuit of resources. A squad of rocket-launcher-equipped Lancers can't travel very far per turn, or capture as quickly as infantry soldiers, but they're the only units on foot that can put a dent in armored machines, known as Metals. Metals are probably the most all-around useful unit to place on the board, but they're not as mobile as some of the recon vehicles that help unveil the fog of war, like Scouts, Radar units, or Fighter jets.Most of this should be familiar to anyone who's put more than a few rounds into an Advance Wars game, but Tiny Metal also has some new tricks up its sleeve to keep battles interesting for veterans. Focus Fire is a maneuver that allows multiple units to combo attack a single target. The benefits are twofold: the enemy can only retaliate against one unit per attack, and your combined attack gives you a better chance of wiping the target out before they get the chance to fire back at all. The riskier move, Assault, allows you push enemies off of a specific square, but at the cost of the enemy being able to fire first. Tiny Metal also has a Hero unit system where a super-powerful version of a specific unit type can be summoned to wreak havoc, but only once per match. These tactical considerations keep matches lively and unpredictable, and help distinguish Tiny Metal from being a mere Advance Wars copycat.Following the tutorial battles at the start, the difficulty gradually increases as tactical options grow more diverse, with new units and commands appearing at a steady rate throughout the six-hour campaign. With multiplayer on hold until next year, one-off skirmishes are the current best way to keep playing after the credits roll, though they take some getting used to. Skirmish mode offers over 50 challenging battles, often in either inordinately small playing fields, groupings of rough terrain, or situations where you are grossly outnumbered and outgunned by the enemy. These fights will definitely keep you busy, but the jump in difficulty from the last mission of the campaign to even just the first few skirmishes is a big one that's initially off-putting.The PC version of Tiny Metal is notably better looking and allows you to use a mouse, but fans of Advance Wars will find that playing on the go with Switch completes the nostalgic experience. The only major flaws in portable mode are the tiny fonts used in some menus, and a marked decrease in resolution when the camera zooms in to watch two units attack each other. The PC version gets more graphical options, and an unlocked framerate, but Tiny Metal's throwback action feels at home on Nintendo's portable.Newcomers to the turn-based strategy genre are likely to have a blast with Tiny Metal all the way through its campaign, though the endgame is no doubt a little restrictive. Old hands to this type of strategy game will find a campaign that wears its influences on its sleeve, but still admirably and respectfully fits right in with them. It’s the kind of game where you jump in just to take two or three more turns and suddenly an hour has passed, and you can’t rest until that pesky enemy gunship or tank fleet is down for good. Hopefully that can continue next year if the multiplayer patch comes as promised."
902,Dillon's Dead-Heat Breakers,6.0,1,"Most of the game makes the transition well, in part because the premise is played in a tongue-in-cheek fashion. Dillon's a no-nonsense guy, and seeing him surrounded by a colorful cast of goofy sapient animals works pretty well. But, after a time there's definitely the feeling that too little game is spread out over too much time. Dead-Heat Breakers grinds to a crawl at times, and while it's far from insurmountable, it's hard to shake the feeling that in this case less would have been more.While Dillon may be the game's namesake and main action hero, he's not the actual protagonist. When you start up the game, you'll have a Mii of your choice polymorphed into an Amiimal. And it's this ""person"" that the story centers around. In short, you've narrowly survived an attack on your home town, and you've gone to get help from the infamous ""Red Flash,"" Dillon. On your way, your big rig is attacked by some industrial monstrosities and Dillon and his sidekick/mechanic Russ happen to be in the right place at the right time.Most of the proceedings are played for comedy, poking at the classic tropes of the western, while mixing a good bit of modern absurdity. Not too long after that encounter, for instance, Russ determines that the team needs a massive gun. And they aren't kidding. He maps it all out in his head and sets to work getting the materials to build a weapon that would put World War II-era train-mounted cannons to shame.This pair of scenes (the battle between your would-be attackers and Dillon, as well as the process for gathering materials after the fact) make up the two primary phases of play. They loosely correspond to the day and night and will follow that pattern throughout. In the prep part (daytime), you'll wander around town doing odd jobs for the people and participating in mini-games to gather up the required gear for your nightly missions. This works well for pacing at first, but you'll start to feel the drag as the cycles wear on.Daytime will put you through a few different main activities, including time-trial races and bouts against the series' most iconic foe--the stone-headed, space-faring Groks. Here you can earn money which you can then toss to Wendon for supplies, which go to Russ for assembly into the Breaker (i.e. that giant gun). These are meant to help give you some practice for the more rough-and-tumble nighttime bouts but are too dissimilar to serve as a proper warm-up, and not unique enough to feel like a good break from the main action.When that time does come, though, you and the Amiimals of your friends and other Miis on your system will assemble into a group, ready to tackle the big bad of the night. This is where the series' touted tower defense-action fusion comes in. Here, like in the opening segment, you'll command the Red Flash and have the option of hiring on the different Amiimals to play defense. Each carries a different weapon with their own attack styles and strengths. Ostensibly the daytime's mini-games are there to help acclimate you to these differences, but in practice, over the game's 15 missions, you'll know who does what pretty quickly and can make your own appropriate choices.Dillon's Dead-Heat Breakers is best enjoyed in spurts. Powering through the game quickly reveals its many weaknesses (the toll on your hands, and the repetitiveness of the combat and day-night cycle being chief among them), but no part of the adventure is bad, really; it simply wears thin.Once you've made your choices, you're off to the fight. Your job as Dillon is to keep the pressure off the Amiimals. Using a powerful accelerator as well as Dillon's natural claws and thick hide, you can slam and slash your foes while zooming about the map. On the bottom screen, you'll be able to see a breakdown of the map, the attack range of your team, and which places need your help.Recruiting more teammates helps take the pressure off you but depletes your coffers and therefore cuts your strategic options for later down quite a bit. Therein lies the big question for how to allocate resources.Dillon himself can be great fun to play, but the controls are perplexing. Most everything is handled with the joystick and the A button; attacks are somewhat contextual but rely on holding the button down, releasing before pressing, and holding or tapping quickly to different moves. This isn't ideal as it can be occasionally easy to accidentally dash instead of landing an attack, and the constant strain on your thumb during combat sections would have been reduced if you simply used another button or trigger when your attack was ready.Many of these sequences devolve into high-speed chases where you'll have to clear out every foe during their final assault. There's an excellent bit of white-knuckled tension as you rush from enemy to enemy, spinning up, bashing them, and slashing to bits. Combined with some smart visuals and a great system for snapping you to baddies so you don't inadvertently overshoot them makes these segments a great bit of intense fun--even if they leave your thumbs sore.Dillon's Dead-Heat Breakers is best enjoyed in spurts. Powering through the game quickly reveals its many weaknesses (the toll on your hands, and the repetitiveness of the combat and day-night cycle being chief among them), but no part of the adventure is bad, really; it simply wears thin. It's a competent, fun little outing that's almost perfectly suited for kids who need something silly and ridiculous that won't require too much thought or technical mastery."
1419,Assassin's Creed Chronicles: Russia,5.0,1,"Our hero this time around is Orelov, a Russian assassin on a job at the turn of the 20th century. He's charged with recovering the Precursor box, a key item from the previous two Chronicles games. In the middle of his duties, sneaking into and rummaging through the royal palace for the box, he just so happens to run into one of the more legendary touchstones of Russian history: the execution of Czar Nicholas II and his family at the hands of the Bolsheviks. Legend has it the youngest daughter, Anastasia, escaped the massacre somehow. Assassin’s Creed takes things a step further. Not only does Orelov smuggle the frightened princess out of the palace after running into her during his own escape, but Anastasia discovers that she might have a little bit of Assassin in her.Like many of the best plot contrivances in the Chronicles series, the game has a prime setup here in tying the legend of Anastasia to the game’s lore, but ultimately fails to capitalize. What’s particularly damaging here is that it drags China’s protagonist, Shao Jun, down with it. Anastasia doesn’t come across her power naturally, it’s a latent possession by the unexpectedly angry ghost of Shao Jun, who has awakened by contact with the Precursor box. As a result, the game does little to develop the character of Anastasia, and makes Shao Jun a petty murderer in the process. On the flipside, Orelov is stuck in “protect the princess” mode for the entire game, and never develops either. Storywise, the whole thing is a wash.If nothing else, the gameplay benefits from Anastasia being able to fend for herself. While ACC: China and India had only the single assassin protagonist, Russia splits its time between Anastasia and Orelov. Anastasia can’t get into straight up hand-to-hand fights, but she is able to use the Helix Powers from the previous game, allowing her to vanish into thin air for short periods, invisibly dash between hiding spots, and disappear corpses she leaves behind. Orelov can't employ any of these powers but can engage enemies head on--though his fighting style is a bit more stiff and unwieldy--and access to a veritable Batman utility belt. He has smoke bombs and a rifle to pick enemies off from afar. He also has a grappling hook to pull obstacles down, which can be used to latch onto electronics and send a pulse to knock it out.Ironically, bringing this style of gameplay into the modern age seems to have watered it down. Despite a few new devious obstacles and perils to traverse--the presence of phones, pistols, and automobiles for starters--there are few surprises to be found. Running, jumping, and hiding from vision cones are all competent on a base level, but China had novelty on its side, while India doubled down on pure parkour and platforming. Russia seems confident that splitting the abilities of a single assassin into two characters would keep things fresh, but this doesn't work in its favor.It doesn’t help that both China and India, at their most mundane, at least had captivating presentations. China had its watercolors, India had its henna art. Russia’s art style succeeds in small doses, taking its cue from the utilitarian blocky propaganda of its time period, but the muted grays and reds create an oppressive atmosphere that starts to wear on you as time goes on.Russia seems confident that splitting the abilities of a single assassin into two characters would keep things fresh, but this doesn't work in its favor.That art style is ultimately indicative of the problems with the series, in that, even at its most colorful or active, it falls flat. We’re given few reasons to care about the story or characters, and gameplay doesn’t escalate in a way that make sticking around for the complete three-game journey worthwhile. Newcomers may still find fleeting joy in one of the games for being a bite sized portion of Prince of Persia-style journeys through an exotic land. But the idea of sticking around for seconds or thirds has been proven to be a fool’s errand, and that single portion turning out to be Russia would give a lackluster impression of the rest. Chronicles ends not with a bang or a whimper, but a shrug."
3678,Car Tycoon,5.0,1," Chances are, you've probably never actually dreamed of being a ""car tycoon."" In fact, you've probably never even used the words ""car"" and ""tycoon"" in the same sentence. Fishtank's economic strategy game isn't really based on some childhood dream that we all had when we were very young. Instead, it's more likely a tardy attempt to cash in on the phenomenal success of RollerCoaster Tycoon, a management strategy game from Infogrames that was released over two years ago, yet still enjoys consistently high sales. So does Car Tycoon manage to be as engaging and addicting as RollerCoaster Tycoon? Not really.   At a glance, Car Tycoon looks like a legitimate strategy game. Most of the game takes place in an overhead view of the large city in which you do your business, and the city itself is represented fairly well with somewhat plain but otherwise clean and colorful 2D graphics. The bottom of the screen is occupied by various icons that act as shortcuts to open up small, unobtrusive menus that display clearly color-coded information and data in simple graphs. The game takes place in real time, and several in-game minutes roughly equate to a month of game time. Most games play out over the course of several years, though you can accelerate time or pause whenever you wish. The game doesn't really have any sound effects to speak of (other than a few simple clicking sounds to confirm that you've clicked on a shortcut), but its music is actually pretty decent. Car Tycoon's music consists of a few different upbeat synth tracks that can get repetitive but otherwise aren't that bad.   Unfortunately, once you start playing, you'll see Car Tycoon's facade fall apart. You'll start to notice minor details, like the fact that although the game lets you zoom in and out of the city view, the zoomed-in view serves no useful purpose, and it doesn't even look good, since the further you zoom in, the blurrier the game looks. Also, though the game features some 20 different scenarios and 20 different free-form games across a 50-year period (from the 1950s to the end of the 20th century), and allows you to build old-fashioned Thunderbirds and modern-day coupes, you'll never be able to customize any of your cars other than choosing from a simple set of components, including the chassis, engine, interior, and body. Since you choose to play as one of four color-coded companies, you can't even choose the color of your cars or their parts--if you're the yellow company, all your cars are yellow. It's just as well, since you'll never really get to take a close look at any car you build. Car Tycoon's cars are all represented in miniature on the map, and that's all you'll ever see of them, so if you're interested in really getting into the nuts and bolts of building and designing detailed custom cars, you'll be sorely disappointed.   As a game, Car Tycoon is relatively straightforward--you generally want to make as much money as you can and/or sell as many cars as you can. You can do this by producing cheap cars, offering extras such as discounts or free maintenance, advertising your cars, or investing your funds in the stock market. The game's scenario mode sets specific goals for you, such as selling a certain number of a certain type of car or earning a certain amount of money. This wouldn't be particularly challenging if the game didn't have other problems, like its lack of documentation or its disjointed interface, which often displays vague or incomplete information.   For instance, other than the year-end evaluation the game gives you, it's impossible to get any clear numbers of how many different types of cars you've sold in the past months. You can actually attempt to sabotage the competition, though even if you do appear to have successfully sabotaged a competitor (Car Tycoon will either give you a failure message, or no message at all), you'll basically never see any kind of real result. Also, you must expand your base of operations by buying up additional car factories, dealerships, and garages in municipal auctions, but these auctions tend to come out of the blue and interrupt whatever you're doing, and you'll usually end up buying up buildings all over the map. You can consult a single larger map to jump to your different holdings, but it's hardly useful for keeping specific tabs on all of them--you'll instead want to use the ""jump to next building"" shortcut and bypass the map altogether. However, one of the best ways to make money is to check with the ""big customers"" that are located at random areas of the map, so you'll alternately spend your time combing the large city map looking for them and jumping around to your different holdings. Car Tycoon's biggest problem is that it doesn't have a simple central menu that gives you all the information, figures, and locations you need when you need it. Instead, it has an animated (and rather vague) advisor that may tell you that ""the demand for cars has gone up"" or that ""you've been voted man of the year"" (whatever that means).    Is Car Tycoon at all enjoyable if you can tolerate its many problems? Possibly. If you enjoy a management strategy game that lets you acquire large amounts of imaginary money, and you don't mind hunting through multiple menus just to try to find an unclear approximation of how you're doing, you might enjoy Car Tycoon. And considering that it has 40 different scenarios, you'll be able to get quite a bit of that enjoyment (whatever it might be) from the game. However, if you've seen a few screenshots and have come to the conclusion that Car Tycoon is about as good as most other management strategy games, don't be fooled. Car Tycoon may appear to be a decent ride, but if you're looking for a really excellent management game, you should look elsewhere.    	  "
4518,Interstellar Trader 2,4.0,0," Once upon a time, computer graphical limitations led us to imagine that asterisks were stars, and real galactic emperors might actually have to make decisions based on keyboard choices A through D. Playing Interstellar Trader 2 may make you feel as though you're playing one of these old text-based trading games. The problem is that Shrapnel Games' new space strategy game also has the functionality of an old text-based game. While there are graphics, they actually make the game seem less like a game and more like an exercise in clicking on things for no good reason. While the latter might be a rather cynical description for all computer games, Interstellar Trader 2 takes this idea to its logical endpoint where you're actively reminded that by playing it, you're accomplishing absolutely nothing whatsoever.      Good games make you try to figure out what course of action will lead to the best result. Interstellar Trader 2 makes you try to figure out which good result will be the product of the least clicking. Most of the game takes place in the city screen, which is a representation of all the different places on that planet you can visit, or to be more precise, a representation of all the boxes on your screen that you can click on. But some places can be clicked on only once per visit to that planet.    One of these places is the trade center, where you buy and sell the commodities that are at the heart of your chosen virtual profession of interstellar trader. Once you exit the trade center, even if you made no transactions while you were there, it becomes closed. There is something called the ""galactic bank"" where you can deposit your money prior to leaving a planet so that it cannot be stolen by space pirates. Unfortunately, you cannot make payments directly with money in the bank; you must first withdraw it from your account. You can see where this is going.    Every time you visit a planet, you end up first going to the bank and withdrawing all of your money. Then you go to the upgrade center, because that's the only place you can increase your cargo space, and it, like the trade center, closes after one visit, and you need to have the extra cargo space before you buy your goods or you'll have nowhere to put them. Then you go to the trade center, sell whatever goods you were carrying, buy more goods to fill up your hold, click on all the other boxes in the city screen (like the prime minister, who may randomly give you some benefit), fill up on passengers and gas, and then leave the system. Except your last visit needs to be to the bank, where you then redeposit all your money (except for one credit--the game won't let you have a balance of zero for some reason). If you forget this and get jumped by pirates (there are four pirate clans, which makes no difference at all, by the way), then that's tough luck for you. You should have been more strategic and clicked on ""galactic bank"" before you left. To minimize clicking, you may find yourself just jetting around with all your money in your pocket and taking the risk of having it stolen. In fact, clicking can drive strategy to such an extent that a viable option is to spend the first part of the game building a huge fleet so that you don't ever have to stop at the bank in the first place.   There are a lot of things you can choose to pay attention to, like the stock market, but this just adds more unnecessary clicking. Because of the aforementioned lack of distance between planets, all you really need to do is find a planet where there is a shortage of goods and a planet where there is a surplus of goods. Then you just buy at the latter and sell at the former. In a good strategy game, you would have to balance this one-way traffic against the possibility of two-way buying and selling on planets with less one-sided economies. No such tension exists here. In fact, the one-way method cuts down on clicking since you're not buying at the place where you're selling (which would just mean more clicks, anyway). Once the economy shifts, you simply find a new set of planets, so there's not much strategy there.   Interstellar Trader 2 does a lot of strange things. For example, you can sometimes lose money due to random events or spend money that you don't ""have"" in the sense that your cash is all in the galactic bank. (The game will allow you to fill up on fuel for your ship even if all your money is stashed away, although it will not let you do the same with buying other things.) In these cases, instead of deducting the money from your bank account, the game automatically takes out a loan for you, which you then have to go and pay off if you don't want to pay the interest. You carry out this transaction by, you guessed it, more pointless clicking.   Even if there were serious strategic choices to be made, the game preemptively makes them irrelevant by failing to include a time limit. Because the victory conditions simply consist of amassing cash, and even with bad luck you'll make money most turns, eventually everybody wins. While this is great for kids and nonviolent workshops about the power of non-competitive kindness, it doesn't really work as a strategy game. It does, however, achieve the essential modern game goal of being open-ended.   The game's ephemeral nature is perhaps best encapsulated in--of all things--the save system. There is no way to save the game while playing. If you save, the game automatically quits. There is only room for one saved game, which is erased every time you load it, so if for some reason you just voluntarily quit the game without saving, your game is gone forever. This also applies to involuntarily quitting the game without saving, such as when the game or your system crashes. In fact, we were never actually able to complete a game with the 5 million- or 10 million-credit victory condition, because the game always crashed first. On the other hand, it's possible that the crashes are actually purposely built in as the time limit.   While playing the game, you can sort of make out the rationale for some of the design decisions. The different pirate clans, for example, are supposed to steal different things from you: Some will take inventory, some will take money, and some will just fight you to damage your ships. Since there is no way a pirate should ever take money from you unless you failed to make the difficult strategic decision to click on ""galactic bank"" before you left the planet, those pirates are out of luck. When you encounter the pirates who steal your inventory, you may imagine that you're supposed to make a decision as to whether or not you should defend yourself based on how valuable your inventory is, but since the cost of defending yourself (via various stratagems such as using extra weapons or using the ""suicide volley,"" which there is almost never a reason not to use) is so low, there isn't much of a choice to make here, either.      Interstellar Trader isn't really even suitable as a quick-break game for taking breaks from whatever you're supposed to be doing, because unlike the best of such games, there's really no challenge to overcome that would make you feel that false sense of accomplishment that temporarily replaces the real sense of accomplishment you'd experience if you just stopped procrastinating and got back to work. All you do is slowly amass more and more money by performing rote operations (like the forced order of galactic bank, trade center, and then eventually galactic bank) and watching your cash slowly accrue until you hit whatever amount you set as your victory condition at the start of the game. It's unclear why you would play this game, unless you absolutely hate losing at any game and love to procrastinate. For $20, those might be the only two reasons to buy it. "
48,Viewfinder,9.0,2,"Some of the most well-designed puzzle games are also some of the easiest to understand at a glance. Portal, for all its devious experiment rooms and conundrums within, is simple to break down and explain to new players, letting its depth reveal itself as you use its mechanics in increasingly complex ways. Baba is You is equally straightforward but can get wildly chaotic when you start truly experimenting with how far you can stretch its word-based combinations. Viewfinder neatly fits into their company. It's a short but engrossing puzzle game with a distinct and captivating central mechanic that is satisfyingly explored across a range of challenging puzzles, each of which left a grin on my face upon arriving at a solution.Viewfinder's core concept lets you take static, 2D images and project them into 3D space in the world around you. For example, a Polaroid shot of an otherwise unassuming staircase can be used to construct a new path to a higher platform once projected into the world, carving out space for itself and destroying anything that might have been there beforehand. The more you play around with it, the more you start understanding different facets of how this power can be used to manipulate the serene and delightfully colorful environments around you. For example, while a picture of a plain wall might only show you what was captured in two dimensions, the effect it has once you apply it to the world is much more, sometimes throwing out whole rooms and important objects from behind it. By the same token, where you place your projections is equally important, too, as large structures that you conjure ahead of you can inadvertently shear the environment in such a way that makes reaching your objective more challenging.Viewfinder starts slowly by only offering you predefined photos that you can find around stages, easing you into the mindset that will be required by later challenges. However, it's not long before it truly lets loose by giving you a camera of your own, letting you capture stills from any angle in a stage and use them to devise your own solutions. This moment feels empowering and liberating, akin to finally being able to fire both portal types in Portal after being forced to solve puzzles with only one. It also comes at just the right time, where the complexity presented by puzzles that give you the exact tools you need to solve them is beginning to wear thin. Without the safety net of being given the pieces you need for a solution and challenging you to find them yourself, Viewfinder entrusts you to create your own solutions that can be as straightforward or wholly unique to the way you deconstruct a problem.The aim of each stage is to reach a teleporter at the end of it, with some obstacles thrown in to keep that from being simple. Sometimes the teleporter needs to be powered by multiple batteries in a level where there might only be one, challenging you to figure out not only how to get them to the right place but also how to conjure duplicates without running out of film. Other times, the teleporter is powered by a network of wires, which can easily be severed if you're reckless with where you project pictures. These networks can be powered by sound or pressure plates, other times holding charge in batteries to give you time to get to a teleporter before it shuts back down. Each of these pieces is presented simply at first but quickly combine together to keep you thinking about how each individual solution can make up a grander, more involved one, often requiring a new revelation about the nature of the core mechanic and how it can work in alternative ways.The concept of capturing a moment is stretched in fascinating ways, pushing you to think not just about the physical attributes you're capturing in each picture but also what state in time they're in. A battery photographed at full charge will retain that when reused in the world, creating opportunities for you to reach what it might be powering without physically having to walk as far to reach it. Viewfinder uses this as a central theme in a string of puzzles, but then quickly builds upon it, incorporating what you've just learned in a more complex puzzle while introducing an entirely new theme for subsequent ones to follow. It keeps the sense of discovery strong and makes each victory feel like one triumph over an impossible problem after another, especially when considering how intricate puzzles become by the end. The way in which Viewfinder can consistently keep this going is revelatory but also is afforded by its relatively brief length at just around four hours for completion. There's just a handful of optional (and truly challenging) stages to tackle and collectibles to find, but Viewfinder can easily be completed in a single sitting, and might be best experienced in that way, too.While each string of puzzles is consistently engrossing to solve, the story that wraps everything together is a little less so. Most of Viewfinder takes place in a simulation, seemingly happened upon by two young researchers looking for a device to help save their current climate from crisis. The simulation was created by some genius engineers as a way to continue working outside of the constraints of time, inviting some introspective ideas about the pursuit of perfection if given the space to do so.Your journey through this simulation is guided by Cait, an artificial intelligence that takes the form of an adorable cat. Aside from the disembodied voice you hear occasionally from your handler in the real world, Cait is the only other character you'll interact with. This isn't an issue, though, given how supportive and encouraging he is as you progress swiftly through each puzzle. But Cait harbors a growing sadness as you approach the end, dissuading you from reaching it in the hopes that he won't be abandoned again. It makes your eventual farewell a poignant moment, emphasizing how strong an impression he made in such a short amount of time.As you venture from one hub to the next, you start getting a better idea about the people who built this place and slowly start piecing together why their pursuit to save the planet might have been in vain, although you'll miss most of this context if you don't take time to read the numerous sticky notes and item descriptions around each level. Even with that, Viewfinder's story lacks the impact that its narrative is seeking, making its eventual conclusion land without any sense of emotion. Aside from Cait, there's no other characters that made enough of an impression to be memorable, which is disappointing given how interesting of a world they constructed for you to play around in.Despite an unsatisfying narrative, the bulk of Viewfinder is spent solving a variety of unique puzzles, and it's here where it never falters. The numerous ways in which Viewfinder manages to stretch its core idea consistently kept me entranced, providing a deeply satisfying loop of deciphering a conundrum and constructing a solution that could be distinct to my playthrough. Given how Viewfinder quickly empowers you with the tools to create your own solutions while challenging you to push your understanding of its world, it's pleasantly surprising how frictionless the entire experience is, never once devolving into tedium or frustration. Viewfinder finds elegance in simplicity but doesn't trade this for straightforward solutions, making it one of the best puzzle games you can play today."
1545,The Wolf Among Us,7.0,2,"   my Bigby is: a steel-fisted, impatient bastard who shows little restraint when cornered, but is fiercely protective of Fabletown's most vulnerable residents. As the episode led me through its story beats, I often had the chance to express both sympathy and savagery, and I admit I took some inner delight when pummeling a sickening suspect until he cried for mercy, all while an approving Bluebeard looked on with perverse pleasure. When I got to my knees to speak to a diminutive witness later on, my heart filled with compassion, and I pledged to myself to find the jackass responsible for the tumult. It was when jealousy intruded on my ongoing investigation that I realized how attached to Bigby I'd become. I was angry at the assumptions my accuser was making, annoyed that my time was being wasted, and concerned for the innocent witness watching a volatile confrontation unfold. I let out my inner wolf, and found the same catharsis in it that Bigby did. Perhaps my own demons linger more closely to the surface than I imagined. Smoke and Mirrors is an apt title for a story in which you can't always believe what you see, and don't always find refuge where you look. I'm sorry that I can't be more specific; explaining the details would dull the story's bite. Besides, as you navigate your way through Smoke and Mirrors' multiple crime scenes, events may play out differently. I appreciated how the game acknowledged my previous choices in its details, however. A smashed wall and a missing limb were sober visual reminders of past (mis)deeds that made me more mindful of the barbarian I could be, and some fables' looks of apprehension demonstrated lingering fears over a previous outburst. The characters in The Wolf Among Us aren't highly detailed, but their faces express grief and anger with just the right amount of melodrama to fit the game's noir tone. The atmosphere is possibly the series' greatest triumph. Had the game not taken itself so seriously, its depictions of potty-mouthed amphibians and sadistic warlords might have been more groan-worthy than glorious. Yet the heaving soundtrack, the spot-on voice acting, and the violet skies keep the fantasy grounded. These characters are no longer living a fairy tale. Nonetheless, Smoke and Mirrors occasionally feels like it's spinning its wheels. There are few of the quick-time button events that gave the first episode such tension, and the stakes aren't as high. As a result, the game simmers but never quite boils over, and I was left wishing for more chances to sic myself on a foe as threatening as the Woodsman. As it is, dealing with Smoke and Mirrors' relatively harmless lowlifes doesn't have the same appeal as chasing the smoother criminals, even when they deserve a smack in the mouth now and again. Much of the time, you're left investigating crime scenes and interrogating fables, which can lead to some minor but noticeable idiosyncrasies. I was struck several times by how Bigby's tone of voice changed from one line to the next, betraying how several branches of questioning might still lead to the same line of recorded dialogue. I was also so distracted by a plot point mentioned out of the blue that I had to go back and watch that portion again to make sure I wasn't out of my mind, and indeed, a character delivered a line that appeared to match a different dialogue branch than the one I'd chosen. Ultimately, Smoke and Mirrors feels like a necessary bridge spanning the impactful first episode and the events portrayed in the episode three preview that concludes this episode. It smolders more than it burns, though in some sense, that's an appropriate trajectory for Bigby's ongoing investigation. There's a moment when Bigby lights a cigar and contemplates his next step. That's exactly where The Wolf Among Us stands now: percolating and pondering before the next punch to the gut."
4434,Arctic Thunder,4.0,0,"In 1999, Midway struck gold with its arcade-style boat-racing game Hydro Thunder. Though not the deepest of racing games, Hydro Thunder had its merits. The control was tight and responsive, and the graphics really made the then-new Dreamcast shine. Now, Midway has brought its snowmobile version of Hydro Thunder, Arctic Thunder, to the Xbox. It's noticeably better looking than the lackluster PlayStation 2 version, but it still has its fair share of problems. At its core, Arctic Thunder is a simple racing game--get to the finish line first, and you are rewarded. To try and spice things up, the levels have multiple paths and the courses are littered with a variety of defensive and offensive power-ups--such as land mines, heat-seeking missiles, shields, and speed boosts--that you and your competitors will use to gain an advantage. Along with these standard power-ups, you'll find trick power-ups at the end of the ramps scattered throughout the levels that will trigger a trick animation for your rider and scatter more power-ups across the level. The power-ups aren't the most inventive, but they are entirely necessary, as the game would be powerfully dull if the gameplay were left to straight racing. Even as it stands, Arctic Thunder is not terribly engaging, as the races ultimately boil down to either focusing on defensive weapons and avoiding your competitors or staying in the thick of it and dealing out as much damage as you can, depending on which gameplay mode you're in. Though it sports four different gameplay modes, the differences between them are limited. The race mode will reward a gold medal with secret unlock codes, giving you the ability to modify attributes like the game's difficulty or which power-ups will be available in a race. The arcade mode is nearly identical to the race mode, minus the courses and riders that have been added exclusively for the console version of Arctic Thunder. The points mode rewards you with points for picking up power-ups, doing tricks, attacking competitors, and finishing in a high position. These points can be used to unlock new riders, snowmobiles, and courses. The battle mode throws up to four competitors into an icy arena, where the goal is to simply knock the other rider off his or her sled. The race, point, and arcade modes can be played with up to four players as well. The PlayStation 2 version of Arctic Thunder looked simply awful. Midway has made some use of the power of Microsoft's console, as the Xbox version looks significantly better. All the frame rate problems that plagued the PS2 version are gone, and the game generally looks sharper, with cleaner, brighter textures and a heaping helping of lighting and particle effects. Unfortunately, most of the core geometry remains the same, and the game looks pretty dated when compared with most Xbox games. The levels themselves, which range from the Swiss Alps to the Great Wall of China, do a fair job of representing their respective themes, but they're pretty stingy with the polygons and lack any level of finesse. The rider animation is clunky, though the rider and sled models are passable. When you get down to brass tacks, Arctic Thunder is not fun. The gameplay is repetitive, and the graphics, while an improvement on those of the PS2 version, still don't even begin to make use of the Xbox's potential. Unless you're a developer taking notes on how not to make a snowmobile racing game, there's simply no reason to play Arctic Thunder."
2054,Star Wars: The Old Republic,8.0,2,"   The edge-of-your-seat doesn't let up from the moment you round up a group to the moment you (hopefully) emerge victorious. Unfortunately, there's a rather steep learning curve to what has essentially evolved into a larger-than-life version of what was previously relegated to a pithy minigame. As with any free-range space combat game, the controls can be difficult to nail down until you've completed a few different fights. Full 360-degree range of motion make it disorienting at times, especially when you've barrel rolled yourself out of the line of sight of an oncoming Sith Strike Fighter.      "
4135,Pop,4.0,0,"  Pop is the dark avenue through which to unleash your completely justified hatred of bubbles. As hundreds of spherical globules float across the screen, it's your job to wield your Wii Remote like a pointy stick and, using the A or B button, pop those fragile suckers good. It's a basic concept, and you'll certainly be able to get a decent score by blowing up everything at random, but there is actually a method to the bubble-popping madness. Pop lacks the depth to suck you in like better puzzle games do, but the tranquility of flowing bubbles combined with the savagery of nonstop popping gives it an unexpected charm. For a little while.     The only enemy in this serene world is the clock counting down the seconds to your doom. The depth comes from trying to balance your need for a higher score with the clock's need to end your fun prematurely. Stringing together a run of same-shaped bubbles will earn you a combo bonus, making your score soar while the clock continually winds down. The only way to add time to that unrelenting beast is to destroy bubbles with reckless abandon. Once you learn to deftly shift your focus between chaining combos for a high score and adding precious seconds to the clock, you'll work your way quickly up the leaderboard.        That balance of score-striving and time conservation is the only real trick to mastering Pop. Though levels flow in different directions and at varying speeds, you'll never have to adjust your strategy. As long as you don't miss the bubbles completely while attempting to pop one, you'll be able to continue playing long after the fun has dissipated. High scores are more a matter of hardheaded determination than skill. Even with a few power-up bubbles thrown in for diversity, the repetitive action makes Pop tedious once you get the hang of the balancing act.     The multiplayer mode follows a similar path, but it adds a dose of pure viciousness. The benign power-ups from the single-player campaign have learned a few new tricks that will make stricken players scream with fury. Most upsetting is the lightning bolt, which makes your cursor completely worthless. There is something unsettling about not being able to pop bubbles when they flow mockingly past you. Another cruel charm will blanket the battlefield in black, except for a tiny area immediately surrounding the person who activated this power. Crafty players will bob and weave at random, ensuring no one else is able to steal their precious light source. This mode isn't very deep. And because the focus is more on tormenting your friends than reaching for a high score, matches will end quickly, with no real satisfaction coming from conquering your foes. It's still more fun than popping bubbles should ever be, but don't expect the joy to last.      Pop may be a simple game, but it has a frantic single-player mode and a cheerfully chaotic multiplayer mess. Unfortunately, the mechanics are ultimately too limited to keep you entertained for long. The single-player mode is simply a high-score race with different goals to reach depending on the difficulty level. Without a variety of modes to tool around in, you will quickly tire of the monotonous string of bubbles that must be popped. The multiplayer serves as a wild diversion rather than a consistently engaging competition because there aren't any techniques that need mastering. Though Pop can be fun in short bursts, it isn't worth 700 Wii points ($7). Your cat will love it, though.     "
953,Gravel,5.0,1,"Gravel's single player career mode, dubbed ""Off-road masters"", has you globetrotting between events that mix up different race types and disciplines, with each one loosely connected by the concept of a Gravel TV show. There's not much of substance to this structure beyond the inclusion of an unenthusiastic commentator imparting a few tired lines before and after every race, and a few quasi boss fights that bookend each block of episodes. The latter do at least come locked and loaded with some corny FMV introductions, where fictional racing drivers strike poses in what can only be described as a flaming hellscape. For as amusing as I often found these brief interludes, the mano-e-mano races that follow suffer from the same prevalent problem Gravel does as a whole: they're just kind of boring.That's not to say Gravel's driving model is especially flawed. There's an inherent burst of dopamine that comes from careening around a corner with your car sideways, and the breakneck sense of speed that's achieved when hurtling through the verdurous forests of Alaska is certainly thrilling. But moments like this are disappointingly fleeting. You'll drive on tracks in thunderstorms and in blizzards, and on tarmac, dirt, mud, and grass; yet with the exception of some tyre-spinning snow, there isn't a discernible difference in feel between these contrasting road surfaces. The same can be said of Gravel's vehicles, too, with a handling model that feels loose and floaty across the board, offering no clear distinction from vehicle to vehicle; while the physics engine is consistently bizarre. I encountered numerous instances where a stray bush was enough to send my car soaring through the air in a vomit-inducing spin, and a slight nudge from a rival driver is often all it takes to halt your vehicle's momentum.Meanwhile, multiplayer options are confined to creating your own lobby to invite friends, or jumping into a quick match in the hopes of finding others to race against--but this is easier said than done. After numerous attempts I’ve only managed to find a solitary match, which was populated with three other people (the rest of the grid was made up of AI drivers). Other than this I’ve had no luck finding another race, even a week after launch.Visually, weather and lighting effects are occasionally impressive, but otherwise Gravel's tracks mostly look flat, and a short draw distance leads to shadows and foliage frequently popping into view. There's also a lack of detail to each vehicle's body, and a smoothness to each one that gives the illusion they're coated in a sheen of vaseline. They look more like toy cars than the high-powered mud-churners they should be.In my mind's eye, Gravel's bland visuals contribute to a game that doesn't look too dissimilar from the seven year old titles it most closely resembles. There's something appreciable about its no-nonsense style, and there's definitely some intermittent fun to be had with its arcade style racing. But it doesn't do anything that its contemporaries haven't done better before, and it fails to stand out as an enjoyable alternative, which is unfortunately reflected by its barren multiplayer component. Like the fireworks that occasionally ignite throughout select races, Gravel's attempts at excitement don't quite dazzle."
1684,Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball,6.0,1,"Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is a fast and lively arcade playground, marinated in neon shades and seared by the hottest techno tunes. The lights pulsate as the bass bumps, the colors shift as the action swells, and, somehow, your movement seems to synchronize with the chaos painting the map. This competitive PC arena experience is teeming with character, but with its overly loose controls and absence of meaningful progression, the game pushes its style over its substance. Like disco itself, the enjoyment provided by Disco Dodgeball’s vibrant walls is fleeting, fading like a fad forgotten not long after its initial boom. It fails to make a lasting impression, but that doesn’t stop the action from being gripping and entertaining early on. Robots roll on a single wheel up and down the various maps--resembling dance floors with their vivacious lights--while explosive dodge balls whizz by your head. Power-ups transform your projectiles into boomerangs and provide jetpacks mid-round, so it’s critical to keep your eyes on both the position of your opposition and these enhancements. Blasting opponents out of the air or pelting an unsuspecting robot with a ricocheted ball is supremely satisfying, but learning how and when to take a shot isn’t easy. You’re riding on a wheel against a surface providing little friction, so everyone on the dance floor continues to roll long after letting off the gas. Balls arc downward after being thrown and bounce off walls in often unexpected ways, so it takes a great deal of practice to understand how, when, and where to take a shot with so many variables at play. Multiplayer games are player-hosted, so a high ping can result in robots flying from one end of the screen to the other as if hurled from a catapult; as a result, the already fast movement speed--which is only enhanced by a rechargeable boost--can be a little too sporadic to account for. There’s nothing wrong with combat that takes time to master, but even after hours of play, I never felt fully comfortable with the direction of my explosive shots. Thankfully, there’s more to Disco Dodgeball than just throwing and catching balls. Beyond the classic Elimination and Deathmatch options, modes like Hoops and Grand Prix offer unique, interesting ways of playing with the mechanics. Hoops forces you to focus on fitting a specific ball through a square goal in order to score points for your team, while Grand Prix transforms the map into a speedway of sorts. Instead of using your momentum to dodge oncoming action, you must barrel through checkpoints as you race against the competition. Catching and throwing balls always remains a significant piece of the puzzle, but these various mechanical alterations allow for much greater in-game creativity that what the standard rules supply. Most servers lean toward the classic modes, but mixing up the rules within a room full of competent bots is always an option. Once the early wonder starts to wear off, though, what’s left is a fun curiosity with hooks too dull to pierce the skin. There’s single-player content, including Arcade, Horde, Training, and a handful of other solo affairs, but the real appeal here is the competitive play. Leaderboards and the ability to level up provide some incentive to come back, but other than basic robot customization, the actual tangible rewards for continuing to play the game are weak. Without a true sense of progression, Disco Dodgeball doesn’t do much to pull you back onto its thumping dance floors. When the connection is strong, the balls are bouncing as you intend, and there are enough players to populate the servers, Robot Roller-Derby Disco Dodgeball is a treat. The audiovisual package superbly complements the wall-to-wall mayhem found within a competitive round, and there’s a healthy suite of modes to mix up the action. There’s just not enough staying power, and controls that are a few notches too loose make it difficult to determine a shot’s trajectory. Disco Dodgeball is a creative player in a crowded space, but lacks too many attributes to stand out."
447,Spelunky 2,8.0,2,"In Spelunky 2, the turkey's fate is in your hands.You could hop on the bird's back, making use of its double jump and Yoshi-like glide to flap your way through your run. For a solid payout, you could return it and the other birds scattered throughout a stage to the turkey farmer who oversees their pen. You could whip it unconscious, throw a bomb next to its body, and eat the resulting Thanksgiving platter for one heart--or you could do that last one in the farmer's line of sight, prompting him to take up arms against you, ""you monster.""This is the mode that Spelunky 2 constantly operates in. There are always risk-reward choices to make, and death is nearly instantaneous if you choose poorly. Like its acclaimed predecessor, Spelunky 2 is the rare platformer that demands to be played as much like a tactics game as it does like a Mario game. As you learn (or relearn) how to survive, success requires a willingness to think three moves ahead. Some tiles are booby-trapped to shoot arrows as you leap through their line of sight. Some vases summon a relentless ghost when smashed. Some pottery hides snakes and tarantulas. Some spiders hang from the cavern ceilings, hoping you pass by unaware. You really shouldn't even move from your initial spawn point without pausing for a moment to pore over every treacherous inch of the screen. That is, unless you spawn near a bat, which will swoop down at you--hope you're quick with your whip.This time around, you are Ana, the daughter of the first game's cave-faring protagonist. You've arrived on the moon in search of your parents, who have disappeared while exploring its very un-moon-like caverns. As you head into the mines, Spelunky 2 resembles the opening level of the first game--at least at first. You have a whip, you have some bombs, and you have a rappelling rope you can toss into the ceiling to climb to otherwise inaccessible heights. And the creatures you encounter, like bats, snakes, and spiders, will be familiar, too. And it's all set against a clay brown backdrop which suggests the interior of a surprisingly well-lit cavern.But from there, the game quickly bushwacks its way into unfamiliar territory. There are robots that turn into bombs when you stomp a button on their heads; mechanical ladybugs that spray fire from their outstretched wings; relentless cavemen with boomerangs. Each level--which, per Spelunky tradition, is remixed each time you play via procedural generation--houses new enemies and new environmental hazards to learn to navigate. After the first biome, you're presented with a choice--jungle or robot volcano?--and with either comes a whole host of new rules to learn. All of this is rendered in the same expressive cartoon style as its predecessor. It's slightly crisper and clearer this time around, but it's a tribute to the timelessness of Spelunky's art style that Spelunky 2 isn't more of a noticeable step up.The controls match the art's precision. Developer Mossmouth has added some quality-of-life tweaks--you now run by default and need to hold a button to slow down, instead of the other way around--but mostly, the team didn't mess with a good thing. The highest praise I can heap on Spelunky 2 is that, in a game where you need to land jumps on tiny spits of land, leap above spike pits, and skirt pools of lava, I never felt like my death was the game's fault. Some things take some getting used to, sure. But once you have the hang of things, Spelunky 2 offers near-perfect platforming.It doesn't feel as buoyant as some of its genre contemporaries. Instead, Spelunky 2 feels grounded. Your jump won't take you very high, and your puny whip necessitates getting close to enemies. The game's many traps, unpredictable procedurally generated world, and punishing fall damage mean that the longer you spend airborne, the less likely you are to make it back to the ground in one piece. Spelunky 2's ever-present sense of danger encourages you to make careful, calculated decisions. But if you take the time to analyze the screen before choosing your next move, getting there is usually easy. I often thought deeply about where to go, but that was the hardest part.However, that doesn't mean you won't still die a lot. Mastering Spelunky 2 is a little like penning the Great American Novel; you might have the vocabulary, but that doesn't mean you can put the words together well. Spelunky 2 offers a brief tutorial to get you in the swing of jumping, climbing and bomb-throwing. Those rock-solid basics are your sole lifeline as you begin your adventure. Conversely, learning each new enemy and trap is a baptism by fire. It can feel overwhelming at first. Wait, that thing can kill me? Oh, those blocks shoot spikes? Why does the invincible ghost keep showing up a minute into my run? Over time, though, as you gain your bearings, this feeling almost entirely dissipates. For each seemingly arbitrary death the game doles out, there is a lesson about a set-in-stone rule waiting to be learned. There are some exceptions--I was still occasionally frustrated by the Naked Mole Rat, which moves erratically through dirt tiles, and more than once I was insta-killed by a bear trap that was barely visible in some tall grass. But, on the whole, Spelunky 2 does a stellar job of displaying all the information you need to know at all times, once you know how to read it.Spelunky 2 doesn't mess with the original's formula too much, but the changes it does make keep that formula fresh. New biomes, like the world filled with robots and lava, come with new challenges for experienced adventurers. As each world begins, you will be unsure which tiles you can stand on and how new enemies will behave. It's extremely satisfying to master a space that once killed you instantaneously. You don't unlock new weapons or level up; instead, as the cliche goes, knowledge is power. Thankfully, as you're learning a new world, you can contribute to one helpful NPC's quest to dig shortcut tunnels to the later stages, allowing you to leapfrog over the early game to the spots that are giving you trouble.Spelunky 2 doesn't mess with the original's formula too much, but the changes it does make keep that formula fresh.Mechanically, the most significant addition, as attested to by the turkey anecdote above, is the inclusion of mounts. These double-jumping creatures make it significantly easier to breeze through levels. They move quickly, and some can attack from a distance, offering a nice change of pace on the runs when you find one. But they're also easy to accidentally kill (and, in the turkey's case, there is incentive to purposely kill them for health). I was always extremely grateful to find a Rock Dog, a pink fire-breathing goat creature that can be spotted and tamed in the wild or purchased at a store. And I was likewise sad to see them go when hit by an arrow or burned up in lava. A major positive of their addition is that they can tank that damage for you, effectively granting another hit point and, in some cases, a second life.Spelunky's additional modes have returned. I had a good time messing around against bots in the frantic competitive fun of Arena. But the modes I see myself returning to are Online co-op and the Daily Challenge. At the moment, my Online experience has been consistently hampered by pretty significant lag. It's a shame because rushing through Spelunky 2 with strangers is a terrific, zany time and a great way to experience the later levels before you're skilled enough to reach them on your own. Mossmouth has already pushed out several updates since launch, so hopefully the lag improves over time. Meanwhile, Daily Challenges, which offer you one shot each day to complete a successful run of the game, continue to offer exciting tension. This challenge may entice me to keep returning to this game long after I finally claim victory in Adventure mode.In fact, the most damning thing I have to say about Spelunky 2 is that it mostly feels like more Spelunky. The new mechanics, like mounts, and the new stage themes feel right at home. To me, Spelunky 2 seems familiar. Obviously, that isn't a bad thing. The first Spelunky is a fantastic game, and Spelunky 2 improves on its formula. Making the best version of Spelunky possible is a worthy goal, but Spelunky 2 suffers a little from the lack of ambition beyond that. Despite the great time I'm having with this game, my excitement is tempered slightly by the nagging feeling that this is mostly just a better take on the original design, rather than an ambitious, entirely new thing.At least, that seems to be the case right now. The original Spelunky's proc-gen depths hid secrets that took time for its avid community to discover, so it's possible that Spelunky 2 has secrets of its own that I have yet to find, and they could push the game in a different direction from its predecessor. Spelunky 2 is a successful evolution of what made the original Spelunky work; the tight controls, impressive use of procedural generation, expressive art style, and interesting stage themes are better than ever here. But the more notable changes in how we play and talk about this game will likely happen in the coming months as players discover the heart of the game in the deep, dark depths we aren't yet even aware exist."
1167,Persona 5,9.0,2,"Like its predecessors, it's part social simulator, part dungeon crawler. By day, you're a high school student--busy taking classes, visiting cafes, watching movies, and hanging out with friends. But by night you are the leader of the Phantom Thieves, a ragtag troupe of idealistic teenagers that infiltrate a parallel reality called the Metaverse. Here, the corrupted hearts of adults have manifested as Palaces, and the Phantom Thieves must find and steal Treasures within them to reform their marks, and by extension, society. Think Lupin the Third, but with a socially conscious supernatural twist.Together with your friends, you infiltrate the Metaverse. Here lie physical representations of people's personalities, called Personas--angels, demons, and monsters of all shapes and sizes that you battle using elemental attacks. Physical moves can be used to chip away at health points incrementally, but exploiting an elemental weakness elevates battles from turn-based slapsies to a flurry of crushing combos. Hit an enemy weak to fire with Agi and it will crumple, giving you an additional turn to exploit another enemy's vulnerability, either by switching Persona to adopt a different elemental alignment or by passing the baton onto a teammate who can pick up where you left off. Once they've all keeled over, you can launch an All-Out Attack and watch as black silhouettes of your team dance across a striking red background, slicing and dicing enemies until they burst into a shower of blood. This triumphant animation calls to mind The Bride's iconic blue room battle against the Crazy 88 in Kill Bill, and even though you'll see it hundreds of times it never stops being cool.Improvements to the battle system mean that if you've already identified an enemy's weakness, instead of trawling through menus to locate the specific ability, tapping R1 takes you straight to the move you need. When combined with the baton passing, streamline the turn-based fights into pacy experiences that maintain forward momentum with ease. There's nothing more satisfying than firing off Persona spells, tagging in teammates, and wiping out waves of Shadows without them even getting a look in. Persona 5's combat pulls together some of the best elements from previous games--and it's borderline addictive as a result.Persona 5's combat pulls together some of the best elements from previous games--and it's borderline addictive as a result.Negotiations from early Shin Megami Tensei and Persona titles also make a return, but the system is much improved. If you knock down a Shadow, you'll surround it with guns drawn and can commence an All-Out Attack or simply talk to them. The conversation becomes a weird Q&amp;A about your character or society a whole, and it often throws up some hilarious dialogue. There's nothing quite like winning over a succubus by playing hard to get or gaining the favour of a giant demon sitting on a toilet by telling him you, too, are a pretty easy going kinda guy.Whether you're successful or not, negotiating will get you something. You can demand items, money, or a monster's allegiance, but whether your request is granted depends on your gift of the gab. I found negotiation to be a much more useful reward system than the random pickings offered by Shuffle Time in Persona 3 and 4. When filling my Persona compendium or trying to fuse a specific Persona I'd ask them to join my cause. While grinding I'd use an All-Out Attack to earn more XP. In a pinch I'd demand an item. The new system let me reap the benefits I needed at that point in my playthrough.Palaces are areas given form by the distorted desires of powerful, corrupted individuals, while the process of infiltrating is akin to pulling off a heist. You need to identify your target by conducting investigations in the real world, then enter the Palace to explore it and secure an infiltration route. Once you've located the corrupted heart of the individual--represented as an ethereal Treasure--you send a calling card to the target in the real world. This act of showmanship not only alerts the world to the target's misdeeds but also gives physical form to the Treasure in the Palace so it can be stolen.And those Palaces are the best dungeons the series has ever had. No longer are you climbing through levels of procedurally generated corridors to reach a boss at the top. Instead, each Palace contains a myriad of puzzles to crack, traps to avoid, and of course, Shadows to defeat. They are intricate, striking locations that unravel as you explore them, each varying in size, scope, and gameplay opportunities. One is a rat maze filled with locked doors and looping hallways, another is a giant safe that you need to crack, and one is a crumbling pyramid filled with walking mummies. They feel almost like different worlds from a Mario game, each uniquely themed and cycling through gameplay ideas like cards in a rolodex.As Phantom Thieves, you sneak through halls, darting between cover and jumping over obstacles. As you slink into the shadows and ambush an unsuspecting enemy, getting in that crucial first shot, you realize that these Palaces are designed for you to be sneaky. And it feels really satisfying to bounce between coverpoints and ambush an enemy … when it works. Although you're encouraged to take enemies out sneakily, doing so is made difficult by the game's uncooperative camera, which often restricts your view. Similarly, clambering over obstacles doesn't quite feel as good as it should. There are specific spots that you can climb up to access more areas and I often missed these because I wasn't standing in the pixel perfect point to get the prompt needed to jump.But honestly, this is nitpicking. I loved my time in each of the Palaces, wandering around using my Third Eye Ability to uncover secrets and steal treasures, feeling like Batman on Opposite Day. Its puzzles never became too taxing, even in later dungeons that required backtracking to find a specific item, enemy, or switch using the Third Eye. In these areas the game mercifully opens up shortcuts for you, so you don't feel like you're wasting too much time.Persona 5 has a hefty run time and while the story remains engaging until its final moments, the gameplay has some pacing issues towards the end.Balance in such a huge game is tricky. I played on Normal difficulty, and for the vast majority of the game enemies felt well-matched to my level. Persona 5 has a hefty run time and while the story remains engaging until its final moments, the gameplay has some pacing issues towards the end. Instakill attacks, a short supply of elemental power-refuelling SP items, and going long stretches of miniboss after miniboss without a save point mean the latter stages can sometimes feel more frustrating than enjoyable. I've been wiped out half an hour into a fight on multiple occasions, and I'm still a bit bitter.But Palaces are just one part of the Metaverse. Once you take a Treasure, Palaces collapse, so they're not really the place to grind for levels. For those that enjoy the grind-heavy areas of P3's Tartarus and P4's randomly generated dungeons there's Mementos--society's joint Palace, which takes the form of the depths of Tokyo's subway system. This area is long, with many procedurally generated levels spiralling down towards a mysterious, seemingly unreachable core. It would feel like a monotonous job were it not for the Phansite. One of your Confidants believes so much in the plight of the Phantom Thieves that he sets up a website where members of the public can leave messages of support (or memes).More importantly, Phansite users can suggest people they think deserve a change of heart. These are figures that aren't quite evil enough to have their own Palace, but who are still misbehaving enough to spawn a demi-boss within Mementos. These side stories of abusive boyfriends, scammers, and thieves are mere tasters--bite size chunks of justice that you can dole out at your leisure while grinding for experience. Infiltrating Palaces can sometimes take hours, so quickly dealing with a few Phansite Requests in one go is a satisfying microcosm of the larger gameplay loop in Persona 5. Plus it made me feel like Judge Dredd, dishing out justice as I saw fit to clean up the city.Persona 5 creates a rewarding synergy between its social simulator and dungeon crawling by making everyday activities in the former empower you in the latter. With limited time in each day and a constant deadline to steal Treasures by, it's up to the player to prioritize after-school and weekend activities. Attributes such as Knowledge, Charm, Proficiency, and Guts can be improved by studying, working in part-time jobs, crafting tools, or watching DVDs. In turn, these enable you to build deeper bonds with other characters to strengthen yourself and your cause.Persona games live and die on characterisation as much as they do on the RPG mechanics that underpin the gameplay, and in that respect the latest entry delivers a cast that is loveable, quirky, and nuanced in equal measure. Although the main group neatly fits into classic anime archetypes initially, over time everyone reveals the baggage they carry and, as you solidify your bonds, they start to show their complexities, creating emotional moments where you work through their pain together.Sometimes their goals will align with yours and sometimes they won't, so the group can be a little rowdier than previous Persona teams--but that only adds to the experience. I loved that you really had to invest time and effort into each character to crack their personality and unlock how they truly felt. Morgana the amnesic talking cat (it is a Japanese game, after all) is shrouded in mystery, determined to learn about his forgotten past. The quirky Futaba, despite suffering from extreme social anxiety, is the strategic genius behind the group's Metaverse adventures. Ryuji's boisterousness is both the energy the team needs to push forward and the powder keg that could be its undoing. And Ann deals with issues of self-doubt in the competitive field of modelling. These characters grow and change as you spend more time with them: They go from being mechanical tools that you engage with to strengthen their Personas, to real people you can identify and sympathize with. By the time the credits rolled, I felt like I was leaving behind friends I had known for years.Building these relationships with teammates is key to success in the Metaverse. Increasing Confidant Ranks (a rebrand of the Social Link system from Persona 4) by spending time with each of your friends not only affords you deeper insight into their personalities, but also provides bonuses and special moves in battle. A teammate who initially was closed off and distant in the real world can end up literally taking a bullet for you in the Metaverse. Similarly, by improving your personal traits through daily activities you can meet a variety of side-characters that teach you new abilities or offer bonuses that feed back into the battle system.More than any entry in the series before it, Persona 5 manages to make the mundane not only fit into its gameplay loop but be essential to it. Atlus has perfected the back and forth investment and reward dynamic between the game's two parts to point where even doing laundry is gratifying--and how many games can you say that about?While there are moments of levity in Persona 5, the actions of the Phantom Thieves are important and often have much bigger implications than even they intended. Persona 5 deals with complex subject matter and really doesn't shy away from dark, even uncomfortable, story beats. A constant theme of the game is oppression and injustice, specifically how people can be suffering them in silence. It uses personal hardships and the pressures of modern day society to explore how the actions of the older generation affect the future of the youth. But there's also an optimism to it all. Its cast approaches complex issues and takes on overwhelming odds with a clarity and gusto that can only be born from teenage naivety, and there's a refreshing, cathartic quality to being part of that. But of course, just like in the real world, things aren't always black and white, and the game does an excellent job of showing how even well-meaning actions can have adverse consequences.Narratively and thematically, Persona 5 has the potential to overwhelm--particularly once it starts digging into Jungian theories of psychology. Thankfully, however, the writing does a fantastic job of eliminating unnecessary exposition, which ensures the important storylines are clear and everyone--especially series newcomers--is on the same page. It means the first ten hours are a little slow, and may make a lot of surface level observations, but not to the detriment of the story or its characters. Even with the heavy subject matter, it doesn't become overbearing and in fact is filled with little jokes and easter eggs to lighten the mood where appropriate. The localisation team has done a superb job of translating the comedy for a Western audience, too. I'm a big fan of the DVDs you can rent--spoofs of popular Western media like 'The X-Folders' or 'Bubbly Hills, 90210.'"
4049,Silent Scope,5.0,1,"With a few notable exceptions, gun games have remained unchanged for several years. Silent Scope was one of those notable exceptions. It was an arcade game based around a sniper rifle that contained a small screen inside its scope, giving you the ability to shoot bad guys with incredible precision.  Now, the gimmick-driven game has come home - without the gimmick that made it a worthwhile game. The results, as you might expect, are less than satisfactory.   Silent Scope runs on a timer. You, as an elite sniper, move from position to position. Each stop on your sniping trail has a few bad guys, and they all must be eliminated before you can continue through the level. Your game timer continually counts down, and you earn bonus time whenever you move forward through the level. So, if you take too much time, the time will elapse and your game will be over. You also have a set number of lives. If you take too long to cap a particular enemy, he'll start shooting in your direction. Occasional boss fights spring up to break the monotony. Bosses have a certain number of hit points, as well as a weak spot (usually their head) that usually results in a one-shot kill. Some of the bosses are jets and trucks, and there's a boss that uses the president's daughter as a shield, so careful aiming is definitely required. In all, a successful run through the story mode lasts around 12 minutes. A few branching paths are available, giving the game a tiny bit of replay value. Aside from the story mode, there are two simple shooting range modes. Also new to the home version is a training mode, which puts you up against Hogan's Alley-style targets. At first, you simply shoot the bad guy, but it eventually moves on to target recognition.   Much like Resident Evil: Survivor for the PlayStation, Silent Scope is a gun game without a gun. Instead, you use your standard controller to aim your target. Hitting a button toggles the sight between standard and zoom mode. Other buttons can be used to speed up or slow down your reticle in zoom mode, but the control still feels very jerky - and in a game that requires you to fire with such precision, such jerky control all but ruins the game. Graphically, Silent Scope looks just as good as its arcade counterpart. The terrorists, while almost always wearing the same clothes, animate well - especially when their heads snap back after clean head shots. The sound effects mostly consist of gunfire and vocal instructions.   For an arcade game, Silent Scope has a lot going for it. But the added training mode in the home version doesn't make up for the fact that you can master the game in less than a day. Add to that the extremely substandard control, and you're left with a game that is barely worth renting."
4771,The Mark,3.0,0,"  It would be so easy and tempting to describe how bad The Mark is by making some cute remark like, ""The Mark is way off the mark,"" or ""The lame gameplay is a black mark against The Mark."" However, that takes more effort than this dreary, lackluster shooter from DreamCatcher and T7 Games deserves. Sure, it's a budget shooter, but that doesn't excuse the fact that it's a very bad game.        The Mark wants to be like a Hollywood-style buddy movie--in this case, a US Marine and a British mercenary who must team up to stop London from being nuked by terrorists. It's a fairly generic but passable plot device, but the game manages to get everything else wrong. The plot itself is overly contrived and makes no sense. For example, before they nuke London, the terrorists need to kill the marine and his sister because they're the only people who can identify the missile they plan to use. But wouldn't the missile be vaporized by the nuclear explosion? There's also the fact that the bad guy's father, a gazillionaire, finds out about the plot and wants to stop it. But instead of picking up the phone and calling, say, the British government, he hires a mercenary to protect the marine. Because as long as he's alive, the terrorists won't launch their missile because he could identify it!     But wait, there's more. The characters are like badly drawn caricatures. There's Steve ""Fletch"" Fletcher and Austin Hawke, a couple of manly hero names if there ever were any. They like to spout inane dialogue that's terribly delivered. They also fly around in a small, one-man jet, which apparently defies the laws of physics because the jet already has a separate pilot. At one point, the two heroes, their pilot, and the sister are all on board. There must be a lot of sitting on laps in there; how cozy.     The plot--as silly as it is--could easily have been overlooked if The Mark delivered a decent shooting experience, but it doesn't. This is a game that makes the act of shooting a gun a chore. As you advance through each level, you'll battle an almost endless stream of bad guys. Oftentimes the game ""surprises"" you by having them pop out of corners and cut you down without warning, but after the 20th or 30th such encounter, this gets old. So you'll die a lot, memorize the location of bad guys, and then get past a choke point on the third or fourth try. Getting through the game requires the frequent application of quicksave and quickload, as well as having the willpower to continue.     The Mark tries to mix things up by letting you choose which hero to play as throughout the game. This lets you experience a slightly different route through each level, but the differences between the characters are negligible. You can also play the campaign cooperatively with another player, though trying to find someone to play with online is going to be very difficult--but more on that later.     If you're looking at the screenshots, you may think that the game looks decent. Sure, there's a glossy slickness to surfaces, and some of the environments look interesting. However, the game falls apart when it's in motion and can cause eye strain because of the badly selected color palette, the poor frame rate, the jerky animations, and the over-the-top blur effect that you need to tone down to the absolute minimum to avoid migraines. The Mark constantly recycles the same character models, so each level basically has only three or four different bad guys, and you see the same guys all the time. The level design also gets old fast, particularly in an aircraft carrier where you have to open the door to compartment after compartment and wage a firefight in each one. Things get particularly bad in the aircraft carrier because the frame rate drops to a stutter on a high-end PC. The sound effects are completely generic, but they're the best part of the audio, as the voice acting is third-rate, at best.        When it comes to multiplayer, The Mark serves up the standard deathmatch mode, in addition to the aforementioned cooperative mode, as well as a map-control mode. However, you'll need luck trying to find other players online. This isn't a popular game, and considering the fierce competition for multiplayer shooters, that probably isn't going to change in the near future.     The Mark isn't a humorous or fun game in any sense of the words. It's also a tedious game that taxes your patience and your endurance. When you get down to it, there are simply far too many other shooters that you can spend your money on, and most of those will offer a more enjoyable and fun gameplay experience than The Mark.    "
1161,The Walking Dead: The Telltale Series - A New Frontier,6.0,1,"Like this season's first episode, Above the Law kicks things off with a flashback. This brief look into the past helps establish the leading foursome as something of an alternative family unit for the zombie apocalypse. It’s also oddly hopeful in contrast with the present, which is full of hardships and unexpected curveballs.The themes about the importance of family ties in a world where nobody can be trusted aren’t exactly subtle here, but they work, thanks mainly to the advancement of the relationship brewing between Javi and Kate. Now that their predictable mutual attraction is finally addressed, we get to see the group dynamic shift in meaningful ways.Seeing these events transpire is gratifying, despite feeling overly predictable. Richmond is exactly the cesspool it appears to be. Clementine returns at the most opportune moment and is every bit the pint-sized badass she was last time out. David is a serial abuser and blowhard practically begging you to steal his wife. Jesus is wise and cool. Tripp is gruff but lovable. And, yes, Above the Law features speeches from corrupt people about how you have to do whatever it takes to survive in a world where the dead walk around and eat people.Most of the above is Walking Dead 101. Nobody will be surprised that those elements are big parts of this episode. Nonetheless, the superb quality of the script, voice acting, and animation (which is smoother and more lifelike than in previous episodes, with no jarring jerks or hiccups that have been relatively common in the past) makes everything compelling to watch even though you get the sense that the story is pretty blatantly maneuvering everyone into place.The lack of meaningful choices proves to be the bigger sin--you might as well get some popcorn out for the first 45 minutes or so of Above the Law.The lack of meaningful choices proves to be the bigger sin--you might as well get some popcorn out for the first 45 minutes or so of Above the Law. It’s easy to forget you’re doing anything but watching an animated movie...and then you wind up getting killed when zombies show up after the midpoint and you’re sitting back from the keyboard or with the gamepad in your lap as a spectator. A fair number of dialogue options appear in the early stages of the episode, but none of them seem to really impact the direction of the story. Most result in typical Telltale feedback like “Kate will remember that” and have no immediate effect on other characters.The action heats up toward the end of the episode when the truth about Richmond’s leadership is revealed through a nod back to what happened to Prescott in Episode 2. Also, a handful of challenging battles with humans and zombies require multiple clicks of keys in order to avoid a chomp or shot in the face. Although the surprise of having to twitch-click your way through battles is tough to handle at first, given the lightweight first two-thirds of the game, nothing here provides any serious obstacles.Everything concludes with a revenge-fueled fight that, while somewhat satisfying, ends in such a copycat way that it takes you right out of the game if you're familiar with the TV show. Instead of something original and natural, you get a forced (and all too familiar) scene that immediately recalls a series-famous trope. As a result, the scene is more derivative than shocking (although you’ll still need a strong stomach to endure the entire thing--at least if you go for the most extreme final stroke.)In other words, bring on Episode 4. As much as Above the Law advances A New Frontier’s narrative and sets up what will inevitably be a chaotic battle for Richmond, there just isn’t enough to do this time around. Telltale’s Walking Dead series always treads the line between interactive fiction and adventure game, but here the whole production tips over the edge to the point where you feel like you’re watching a movie. Granted, it’s a pretty good movie. It’s filled with realistic characters, intense scenes, and some of the most brutal violence depicted in the franchise thus far. But it’s essentially a movie nonetheless, with too many compromises made to manipulate the plot and characters into position for the upcoming finale."
3600,Disney Sports: Football,5.0,1," In the realm of strange games, few are stranger in their execution than Disney Sports Football, a game featuring the normally cute and cuddly Disney characters going at each other in a full-contact, anything-goes-style football game. Wacky concept aside, the game tries to present itself as a fun, simplistic football game for young kids by dumbing down the gameplay style of many current football titles. Unfortunately, all this results in is a sloppy, loose-handling game of football that can't hold a torch to any of the games it tries to emulate.      Disney Sports Football's gameplay setup should be a breeze for any football fan. On offense, the ball is snapped via the A button, and passing is achieved by pressing the right analog stick up, down, left, or right. An icon corresponding to one of the analog stick directions appears above the head of the receivers on pass plays. Running is controlled via the left analog stick, and the R trigger acts as a turbo booster for your runner. Other moves such as juke moves and jumping allow you to evade approaching defenders. Most of these moves are fairly useless due to the sluggish response time of the controls. Most would-be tacklers are already halfway toward taking you down before your jump animation has even begun. Defensively, the controls are much the same. The A button acts as the tackle button, and the B button throws your defenders in front of a pass to intercept or at least deflect it. The tackle button itself is just as useless as the offensive controls, as tackles seem to take place well after you've overrun your opponent. Oftentimes it's just best to keep control over the defensive-line players and let your CPU teammates handle the tackling.    Advancing in the dream cup mode will earn you magic items that can be used during gameplay. Most of these are fairly basic upgrades, such as speedy shoes or increased player strength, but others are more powerful, including force fields that make you invulnerable to tackles or energy blasts that knock out the opposing team for a brief time. These magic items are an interesting element that might have been realized better had the game been designed with more of an arcade style. Much of the game feels extremely sluggish compared with even the most staunchly sim-styled games, and save for the magic elements and cartoon character players, everything feels very underexaggerated for what the game is trying to accomplish.   From a graphical standpoint, Disney Sports Football does a fine job of throwing a lot of bright and shiny colors at you, if only to temporarily distract from how drab everything else in the game is. The Disney characters themselves look decent enough, but their teammates are all the same recycled generic character models with different names, and they're all pretty boring to look at. The game also suffers from a distinct lack of varying animations--for example, wide receivers have only about two or three catching animations, and the celebration animations that occur after every major play are dull and repetitive. While a game such as this doesn't exactly need the huge host of animations that a game like Madden NFL 2003 or NFL 2K3 boasts, it's boring to watch the exact same tackle animation over and over again on every single play. Ultimately, the game's only enjoyable visual assets turn out to be the various football arenas. Each has its own unique look and atmosphere, and they inject some desperately needed variety into what is otherwise a very uninspired-looking game.      Disney Sports Football definitely has a lot of problems. Its gameplay walks the line between arcade and sim-style football a little too close to the middle to ever be truly enjoyable for fans on either side of the line, and its lackluster graphics and sound devalue the experience significantly. Still, as a football game for younger kids, it has just enough gameplay depth to make it a worthwhile rental. More discerning football fans, however, should look just about anywhere else they can and leave Disney Sports Football in the bargain bin. "
4360,MTV Total Request Live Trivia,4.0,0," Combining liberal doses of shrewd humor with an intriguing diversity of question types and clever cross-references between pop culture and traditional trivia, Berkeley Systems' venerable and consistently impressive You Don't Know Jack series is unquestionably the standard by which all other PC trivia games are judged. Many have attempted to capture Jack's compelling ambience, yet none have truly succeeded. The latest to take up the challenge is Take-Two Interactive's MTV Total Request Live Trivia, a Q&amp;A ""game show"" based loosely on the popular MTV music and showbiz staple that's helped propel aspiring artists to stardom and made a celebrity of its oft-maligned host, Carson Daly. Yet no matter how much you may favor the latest entertainment trends upon which television's Total Request Live is based, its PC trivia derivative just doesn't cut the mustard. Disappointingly presented and blandly written, TRL Trivia is a poor substitute for Jack and not exactly a ton of fun in its own right.   Like most products of its genre, TRL Trivia asks you to answer onscreen questions by keying in one of several prescribed responses--a concept infinitely preferable to manually typing each and every character. The game keeps the process fresh by offering a variety of question types, including the chronological ""timeline,"" the self-explanatory ""guess who,"" and several other variations on basic multiple choice, some of which are clearly more interesting than others. For example, TRL Trivia's ""speed round,"" which resembles You Don't Know Jack's ""jack attack,"" places a keyword atop the screen and flashes a half-dozen responses below. And much like jack attack, it then asks you to decide which responses match with the keyword and which do not; then it asks you to press your designated key within the second or two that each response remains on the screen.   Speed round aside, you are generally given 10 seconds to choose an answer. Correct answers gain points and incorrect answers lose points. Curiously, no penalties are applied for letting the clock run out, nor are bonus points awarded to those who buzz in early. The game features a relatively impressive total of 1,000 questions, and Take-Two plans to produce at least one add-on question pack that will include selected submissions from players and fans who enter their ideas at the TRL Web site. However, it is currently not planning LAN or Internet support and thus will continue to restrict multiplayer TRL to a total of four contestants on a single computer.   Gameplay unfortunately unfolds in a most uninspired fashion. Except for a brief introductory tour through a look-alike depiction of the real-life TV studio, TRL Trivia plays out against a distinctly two-dimensional environment generally made up of a single unattractive background color and superimposed text. There are no videos, no photos, no fancy 3D sets, and only the most minimal of visual effects and animations. Questions sport none of the wordy ingenuity of the Jack series, and the answers are not followed by humorous anecdotes. The dual announcers--neither of which is Carson Daly--deliver their lines with style and flair, yet those lines are rarely funny and in time become highly repetitious. ""They say great minds think alike. I guess everyone missing the same question is thinking alike, right?"" is probably the most amusing phrase you'll hear, and even it gets tired after you've heard it eight times in the course of 60 minutes.   Worse still, the game's questions are seemingly based on the theory that if an event or personality doesn't appeal to the under-16 crowd, it's not worth mentioning. Imagine, if you will, a query based on the individual members of made-for-TV pop band O-Town. Or a quick quiz on the history of Dream, a manufactured girl group that didn't even exist back in the prehistoric days of 1999. Whether it's Nick Carter, Mandy Moore, Seth Green, or the entire cast of Dawson's Creek, the subject matter seems pulled directly from an issue of Seventeen magazine. Moreover, a surprisingly substantial allotment of questions deals strictly with the TRL television program itself. ""How many days did Korn spend at TRL's number one spot with 'Freak on a Leash'?"" or ""TRL helped which artist's CD release date get pushed up?"" are prime examples of just how familiar you'd best be with the intimate details of Carson's showcase if you aspire to win a game of TRL Trivia.   Granted, youthful players may appreciate both the youngness of the celebrities and the newness of the references. And certainly older established personalities such as Val Kilmer and Aerosmith, edgier artists such as the aforementioned Korn, and sporting stars such as Vince Carter do, on occasion, make an appearance. Yet, TRL Trivia is typically a bubblegummer's who's who that simply won't appeal to fans of general entertainment trivia.   MTV Total Request Live Trivia may appeal to junior gamers if just as a way to prove their familiarity with the names, ages, and other minutiae of the latest up-and-coming personality. Yet even they will grow fatigued by the colorless nature of the questions, the bare-bones presentation, and the steady stream of obscure TRL references. Older gamers, on the other hand, will merely feel older and certainly no more entertained.    	  "
1777,Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker,8.0,2,"Super Mario 3D World were a wonderful side dish, offering a very different type of challenge from the rest of the game. Little did we know at the time that the compact, puzzle-like levels would eventually find new life in a full-fledged game, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker. Now, Captain Toad and Toadette, his partner in plunder, have hit the road on a quest of their own, and it's one of the most charming and enjoyable games to grace the Wii U. The two tiny explorers squawk and trot to all corners of the Mushroom Kingdom in search of golden treasure, and occasionally to rescue each other from danger. While it has a gleeful exterior, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker's also a deceptively challenging romp, especially if you attempt to uncover all of the game's hidden items. The Toads' outing is distinct from other adventures in the Mario universe for many reasons, but one in particular stands out: their abilities are pared down to the basics. They can't jump, and they don't take on any super-powered transformations. All they can do is walk, climb ladders, throw turnips, and use their headlamps to fend off ghosts. Such simplicity may sound boring, but it works because you're more reliant on elements in the world than your abilities to get from A to B. You ultimately seek items that are nestled in hard-to-reach corners of levels that are dense with paths and possibilities. Ladders, ramps, and moving platforms may yield an avenue to the stage's goal, a golden star, or they could be false leads. Deciphering all of the interconnecting parts of each stage requires a fair amount of abstract thought and mental coordination. Understanding the lay of the land requires you to rotate the camera around the given stage, which, nine times out of ten, fits within the confines of the screen. Should you need a closer look at your surroundings, a quick button press makes the camera zoom in on Toad's location. Hidden nooks reveal themselves in unexpected places, but quite often, there's nary an entrance in sight. In order to access these tempting treasure holds, you sometimes have to interact with the GamePad's touchscreen to move sliding objects or spin wheels to raise platforms. It's one of the few games that's best played on the GamePad alone, where you can easily see all of the game's visual cues. The Toads' adventure is fraught with more than just puzzles; goombas, ghosts, and butt-stomping birds are just some of the enemies that stand in your way, and they can be especially threatening when you're busy manipulating the stage around you via the GamePad. If you're quick enough, however, you can tap the screen and stun them in their tracks. As in most games set in the Mario universe, it takes two blows from an enemy to bring you down. One hit causes you to shrink, and the next will cost you a life and force you to restart the level, unless you manage to find one of the series' iconic red mushrooms. Yet, you never feel like your progress is in jeopardy. Even if you lose all of your lives, the game sets you up in a cave with a tiny field of plants that yield 1-UP mushrooms so that you can replenish your stock before continuing where you left off. It begs the question: why have a life system at all? You don't spend much time wracking your brain to find a path to the goal in each stage, but you find yourself stumped when searching for hidden gems. At first, you assume these are optional, and possibly forego excavating them in order to progress forward, but you eventually need a certain amount of gems to open new stages. Some backtracking is needed, and while this may be a boring task in other games, the smooth pace at which the difficulty ramps up in Captain Toad provides the skills to tackle puzzles from the past that may have been too tricky during the first run. It's validating and rewarding when you deftly uncover secrets and realize that you've actually learned a thing or two over the course of the game. Once in a while, you take a trip in a minecart, which is filled with turnips that you can toss at enemies and bricks. These moments are a nice respite from puzzle solving, as all you're expected to do is fire away at your surroundings and hang on for the ride, but there are still gems to find, so you need to keep your wits about you and keep an eye out as you whip around mountain peaks, being sure to target everything in sight in a timely manner. There are also bonus levels to enjoy after you complete certain levels that net you extra lives and coins. You occasionally unlock these stages by thoroughly completing full-fledged levels, and you have two options once you enter: wield a pickaxe and plow through fields of turnips for rewards, or pick up cherry multiplier items, which create clones of Toad or Toadette, and slide down ramps to collect extra lives. Two bosses appear multiple times throughout the game, including a fire-breathing dragon in a rising lava pit, and an evil bird, Wingo, who just loves to kidnap Toads. Every time you face one or the other, the respective challenge evolves gracefully, requiring stricter timing and attention to your surroundings than before. However, save for the final battle, they aren't difficult. In order to totally complete most levels, you need to find every gem and get to the star under extreme constraints. Sometimes that means stealthily slipping past enemies without alerting them; or you're challenged to find a golden mushroom in an unlikely place that's invisible save for a faint sparkle. For the true treasure tracker, there are plenty of challenges that ask you to look at old stages in new ways, and these are the most challenging moments in the game. If you happen to have Super Mario 3D World saves on your Wii U, you're automatically treated to a selection of bonus levels taken right from that game, but even if you haven't played 3D World, fear not, because the same levels open up once you complete the main Treasure Tracker chapters. There's nothing wrong with extra gameplay, but these stages aren't as mentally stimulating as the main game. Toad and Toadette's journey is so interesting because the puzzles and stages are designed around their limited abilities, and almost every moment is spent solving a small part of a larger puzzle. While the bonus stages are adapted to suit the Toads' skillset with the introduction of ladders and moving platforms, they don't embody the puzzle-like structure that makes the rest of the game so great. You still get to enjoy an extended romp through the Mushroom Kingdom, but it's different and less appealing than the primary adventure. Were Captain Toad's world not so appealing, it would be easy to grow tired of the repeat playthroughs if you need to go back and collect items like I did, but the cartoony, whimsical Mushroom Kingdom is easy to love, with layer upon layer of charm. From goombas in swim rings that flap their little feet underwater, to the tiny birds that land on Toad's head when he's idly wasting time, Treasure Tracker has a lighthearted and lovable presentation. It has the right mix of atmosphere and challenging puzzles to keep you engaged, and it's a great experiment within the larger Mario universe. It may have started out as a minigame, but with its original take on the Toad character and a large number of enjoyably tricky puzzles, it's great to see it in the spotlight it so truly deserves.  "
2877,Battlefield 3,8.0,2,"     Combat is not just about where you are, but also about how you get there, and the variety of vehicles is one of the things that makes Battlefield so uniquely engaging. Small maps might only have a Humvee or a light armored vehicle, while larger ones boast buggies, tanks, amphibious transports, helicopters, and jets. There are a few variations within each class of vehicle that make them better suited for troop transport, anti-infantry, antiair, or anti-vehicle combat, and learning how to get the most out of each one is a blast, even if you're sometimes the one getting blown up. Whether you're piloting, gunning, or just going along for the ride, vehicles offer a key tactical element that can change the tide of battle when used by a savvy squad. Using a vehicle well can earn you powerful upgrades and bonus weapons, but it can be tough to get the hang of the flight mechanics for helicopters and jets. It's a shame there's no way to practice flying them outside of active multiplayer matches (with one exception), though you can take comfort in knowing that you are at least entertaining your fellow players when your jet nose-dives into a mountain.      Battlefield: Bad Company 2, so now the assault class slings health packs and totes defibrillators, while the support class carries light machine guns and ammunition boxes. Engineers still thrive on vehicle support/destruction, and recon delivers long-range death. New gadgets like robots that can arm charges (engineer) and mark targets (recon) give players more to look out for on the battlefield, and claymores and mortars (support) ensure that the engineer class isn't the only one packing an explosive punch. Unlockables include class-specific weapons and gadgets, gun-specific sights and attachments, and specializations that can make you tougher and deadlier. Focusing on one class to unlock higher level gear has its advantages, but so does spreading around your progress in an effort to be more adaptable to the ebb and flow of combat.      Battlefield 2, but in spirit, the competitive multiplayer is a refined version of that offered in Bad Company 2. Nevertheless, it will be immediately familiar to veteran players of either game, though fans of Bad Company 2 will encounter a few other small but notable differences. Buildings are not easily destroyed in Battlefield 3 and underslung grenade launchers  are, as of now, far less prevalent. Furthermore, you can't just run up to someone and stab him in the face for an instant kill; you need to get in two swipes or sneak up from behind. Nor can you simply rely on explosives to destroy M-COM stations in Rush mode because arming and detonating the charge is now the only way to progress.        As with the previous Battlefield games, the focus is on teamwork. Diverse loadouts encourage you and your squad to make complementary choices, and point bonuses reward you for working together. Every vehicle is better with teammates in it, and even the simple act of spotting enemies is an effective way to contribute to your team's efforts. Teamwork is woven throughout the fabric of Battlefield 3's multiplayer action, and when your team is working well together, it's one of the most gratifying experiences you can have in a game.      Battlefield 3 also has six cooperative missions that require teamwork on a smaller scale. These stand-alone sorties have a narrative connection to the campaign, but they are tougher to complete than most campaign missions and you can unlock some nice weapons for use in the multiplayer. Setting up voice chat with your teammate is helpful here, especially in the stealthy sections, because the spotting mechanic doesn't sufficiently differentiate enemies at long distances. Your foes are fairly tough, even on normal difficulty, though some unexpected quick-time events can also catch you off guard. The most notable mission here puts you in the cockpit of a helicopter, which provides the only chance outside of multiplayer to practice your flying skills. Earning all of the weapon unlocks requires repeat playthroughs of these missions, so it's a shame there aren't more of them to keep you busy.     Finally, there's the campaign. Battlefield 3's single-player adventure tells a harrowing tale of a fictional modern conflict. It follows a familiar formula by delivering a short campaign with diverse combat scenarios and dramatic set pieces. The story is solid and has some good acting, but the ""Now tell us about this mission"" interrogation mechanic makes the structure feel stale (having made a notable appearance in last year's Call of Duty: Black Ops). The focus on realism makes the unrealistic elements like the heavy-handed linearity, quick-time events, and reckless foes even more noticeable, but most disappointing of all is the campaign's utter failure to capitalize on any of the series' strengths. The lively personality of the Bad Company games is nowhere to be found, nor is the operational freedom on which the series has thrived. When you climb into the cockpit of a fighter jet, you are merely the gunner in an on-rails sequence rather than the hotshot pilot. There are some gorgeous environments and a few exciting sequences, but these are outweighed by the overly familiar cityscapes and set pieces that were clearly inspired by other shooter campaigns from the past few years. This contributes to the pervasive sense that this campaign is not only outdated, but also outclassed.      Fortunately, Battlefield 3's competitive multiplayer is among the best in its class, providing immensely rich and immersive combat zones. These are complemented by the slick browser-based Battlelog, which serves as the hub from which you access each game mode. With EA's Origin software running unobtrusively in the background, Battlelog tracks your unlock progress, displays your stats, and enables you to join parties and launch games easily. Battlefield 3 may not offer much beyond the multiplayer, but there are so many ways to contribute and feel like a powerful soldier that after hours and hours of playing, all you'll want to do is play more.    "
2966,Achron,6.0,1,"  Have you ever really sat down and tried to make sense of time travel logistics? The more you try to make sense of the inevitable paradoxes that arise, the more your brain threatens to turn to jelly. Developer Hazardous Entertainment has tackled the problem--and come up with some creative solutions--with its real-time strategy game Achron. In Achron, time is fluid; you can issue orders to your units not just in the present, but also in the past and in the future. The time travel mechanics add an intriguing strategic dimension to the standard RTS formula and lead to some occasionally mind-blowing moments. It's a pity that Achron's fundamentals don't do justice to its innovations. The pathfinding is terrible, leading to uncomfortable micromanagement just so you can get a single unit around a rock. And Achron is just plain ugly, which isn't only an aesthetic concern: many of the unattractive units look so similar, you can't differentiate one from another. If you hunger for inventiveness, you'll find it in Achron--a game that requires you to think outside of the usual three dimensions. But this budget-priced RTS is also a reminder that innovation needs the support of rock-solid fundamentals.        Achron's basics are those of a typical science-fiction strategy game. As one of three factions, you collect resources, research technology, build structures, and produce battle units in order to wipe your opponent off the map. But Achron adds a mind-boggling layer of time-traveling complexity to the mix, starting with the timeline that spans the bottom of your screen. Here, the events of the past, the present, and even the future are summarized--and your orders and grand strategic plans aren't limited to the present. By clicking somewhere on the timeline, you are immediately taken there, and your real-life present becomes the in-game past (or future). Mind you, this doesn't change the time in which your opponents might be strategizing. Each player works with his or her own personal timelines within this complex structure in which a portion of the past and a portion of the future are a single click away. But while you get access to view any portion of the ever-progressing timeline, you can't issue endless orders willy-nilly. Your ability to command units is limited by an energy bar; the further back you venture into the past, the less control you have over the proceedings.          The differences among the three factions add even more variety to this brilliant confusion. The human faction is the most approachable, though they have their fun toys, such as a slingshot to propel units into other regions. The alien factions--the Grekim and the Vecgir--are more unusual. As the Vecgir, you produce pilots and, in turn, assign them to vehicles. When the vehicles are destroyed, you're still left with troops willing to fight to the death. Furthermore, these aliens come with the benefit of speed: with the proper upgrade, they can teleport without needing to be in range of a teleporter. Swooping about the map and forcing your opponent to wonder where and when your airships might emerge is a blast. The Grekim are all about self-replication. Troops and troop-producing structures are one and the same; planting two different units near each other (that is, activating their progeneration mode) lets them produce units of a different type. They are an adaptable race thanks to their ability to propagate almost anywhere, and many of their troops can chronoport without the use of a chronoporter.           The single-player problems don't end there. The story is pretty involving and covers four campaigns and 35 missions. (Expect to spend a few dozen hours on it if you want to see it through.) Human and alien commanders battle and parlay, and sentient AIs are abusive and abused. The voice actors are clearly not professionals, but they're having a bit of fun in their roles, which makes it easy to forgive some lackluster line readings. It's too bad their lines are accompanied by drab, amateurish drawings without a hint of energy or style. At least they're consistent with the game's overall look, which could be described politely as ""humble,"" even though ""ugly"" might be more apt. Plain, blobby units painted with broad strokes of flat color skitter across dreary tundras and deserts. Clashes don't erupt with fire and vibrant hues; instead, defeated units disappear in subdued displays of shrapnel. The sound effects provide a bit of ""pew-pew"" and ""beep-beep,"" but they hardly capture the essence of planetary war. Gameplay trumps graphics, of course, but this is a case in which graphics are detrimental to the user experience. Troops are so bland and similar to each other that it can be difficult to tell one from another--a real issue when you need to make some split-second decisions for an individual unit. In some missions, units blend right into the backgrounds, which exacerbates the cumbersome micromanagement. It's too bad the visuals and sound effects didn't take their cues from the soundtrack: a collection of ambient tunes and dramatic riffs that provide color and contrast in an otherwise dingy game.         Pathfinding and AI are only two of the subpar essentials. Saved games don't always work the way you would imagine. Your place in the timeline may not be saved, your control groups might be unassigned, and the camera may start in the spot at which the mission begins, not the spot at which you saved. You could go back in time and trigger an old bit of dialogue--and then trigger new dialogue, causing overlap. (In that event, even the subtitles appear over the top of each other on the screen, resulting in gobbledygook.) And the game wrests control away from you for a bit of story exposition, yet lets the battle you were involved in continue without your input. And other RTS essentials you may have hoped for are strangely missing, such as an end-game breakdown of comparative statistics. Achron doesn't offer a slick and satisfying end-user experience.    does offer is a large amount of content featuring a truly new and extraordinary layer of strategy. It seems to be balanced well, though the time travel mechanics complicate traditional notions of RTS balance to the point where they may not even apply. It's a shame that this astonishing innovation isn't supported by the pathfinding, the AI, and the tight presentation it deserved. If you've got a few friends who fancy the idea of massaging time in the way an organist manipulates the keys, Achron could be your new online playground. Just be warned that this fancy time machine was built using rusty bolts, bent nails, and masking tape.      "
253,Pupperazzi,5.0,1,"Sundae Month's Pupperazzi is, conceptually, adorable. Set in a world almost entirely inhabited by playful pooches, the first-person photography game perfectly aligns with a growing desire for more peaceful experiences, making it ideal for those looking for cozy games. However, all these warm fuzzy feelings and vibrant world aren't enough to make up for Pupperazzi's frustrating lack of variety when it comes to things to do, which ultimately leads to a repetitive gameplay loop.In Pupperazzi, you play a living camera, equipped with stringy limbs and hands perfectly crafted for giving pets and throwing frisbees. Your photo-filled adventure begins in a small cove beside a lighthouse, where an endearing ""sea dog"" clad in a yellow fisherman's jacket greets you with a simple request: Take a picture of him.Accomplishing this task, and interacting with the world in general, is fairly straightforward. In Pupperazzi, you remain in first-person as you scout locations and as you ready your camera to take photos of all the game's rambunctious pups. While walking around, you have the options to crouch, jump, pull out your camera, and extend your spaghetti-like limbs to interact with both dogs and random objects. In your menu, you can adjust what lens and film you are using, allowing you to take plenty of fish-eye photos in ""far out"" colors, super-cute selfies, and even some somber black-and-white portraits.After taking your first photo and submitting it to the scruffy sailor for review, the rest of the game starts to unfold as you fulfill photo requests to earn golden bones--the currency used to purchase new film, lenses, and camera upgrades that help elevate your photography to new heights. You can also find a handful of these bones hidden around the game's quirky and colorful locales, a small incentive to traverse Pupperazzi's various boardwalks, red rocks, and city blocks. Ultimately, acquiring bones and making these purchases doesn't just serve as a means to enhance your artistry; it also helps you accomplish more complex requests which, in turn, unlock different areas of the game.While the seaside cove you begin in is a bit small, housing only 20 or so tail-wagging beach bums, subsequent levels are a bit larger and more intricate, offering up plenty of room for even more pups and photo-worthy moments that are well worth capturing--even if they don't meet the criteria required to fulfill your requests. You see, all your beloved snapshots also serve another purpose in Pupperazzi: making you a social media star. Each picture you take in the game can subsequently be uploaded to Dog Net, Pupperazzi's in-game social media network where canines from all over the world offer up compliments on your artistic endeavors… until they've had enough and call you out for ""spamming,"" that is.However, while I found myself positively offended the first time one of the anonymous canines of Dog Net chastised me for my adorable-yet-redundant photography, it didn't take long for me to share their sentiment, and grow weary of what felt like an even more burdensome kind of ""fetch"" quest. While Pupperazzi might be conceptually adorable, its combination of cute dogs, quirky environments, and somewhat contrived feeling ""cozy vibes"" are all polish on an experience that is regrettably surface-level at best and empty at worst.There's a very intentional simplicity to Pupperazzi--a conscious effort to shy away from overly gamifying its photography in favor of focusing on self-expression and the simple joy both dogs and creating art brings us. This is clear in both the game's overall delivery as well as its sole focus on camera upgrades. However, it doesn't take long for this simplicity to feel a lot more like vacancy than heartfelt minimalism. In veering away from gamifying Pupperazzi's photography, there's not much game left.The way you obtain your tasks is simply by showing up at a new location, going to your menu, and opening a handful of texts instructing you on what type of photo they want. When you share your images on Dog Net, the comments you receive are regurgitated and don't make you feel as if you've captured anything new or noteworthy. While you do have an album that keeps track of every breed of dog you've seen and their special actions, it's not implemented in a way that feels connected to the rest of the game. There's no incentive to fill the album, and you can't view it without leaving your current location and going back to the main map.That said, you'll find yourself regularly being forced back to the map to refill on film, given that you're initially limited to 10 shots per location. This loop quickly grows tiresome, and while you can slightly increase your film capacity a bit later in the game, the lack of any mechanics or features that incentivize you to use your film more methodically--or an interesting reason to revisit the world map--makes the limit off-putting as opposed to a thought-provoking consideration.All this adds up to a lack of immersion or sense that you're on an extraordinary scavenger hunt of sorts, uncovering unknown secrets about this world overrun by dogs. And without that sense of adventure or a narrative, the game then relies on having compelling exploration and an expressive photo mode. Unfortunately while the world of Pupperazzi is pleasant, navigating it--both freely and from behind your camera--is not. Despite having various settings specifically designed for motion sickness--all of which I enabled--Pupperazzi's jerky camera and frame rate issues (even on my Xbox Series X) left me feeling nauseous to the point of having a moderate headache each time I played. This was only exacerbated by the game's repetitive music, as well as controls ill-equipped to meet the demand for light platforming to find each level's hidden quest.Weirdly enough, the dogs themselves also felt a bit off at times. Much like the game's locations, the dogs ultimately felt vacant, as many of them merely sat in position awaiting your camera. The ones that were wandering about, while fun to watch, were a bit strange to interact with. When you pet a dog in Pupperazzi, they are drawn to you in the same way friendly animals in Minecraft are--which is to say they stand so close it makes it impossible for you to take a picture of them unless you run and manage to get the shot before they catch up. When you throw toys at them, oftentimes they run away rather than interact with them in the way you might have hoped. At a certain point in the game, you also earn the ability to dress them up in outfits, though the selection is very limited and fails to inject any liveliness into the game or pups.Pupperazzi is a cute game conceptually, but it falters in its execution, making for an experience that I couldn't get behind despite desperately wanting to extend it all the same affection I have for our four-legged friends. Quite simply, the game fails to capture the liveliness and joy that dogs, art, and games can provide us with. While the premise is unique and wholesome, Pupperazzi is ultimately a lot more bark than bite."
2458,FORGE (2012),8.0,2,"  New games have their work cut out for them when trying to carve out a niche in the crowded realm of competitive multiplayer. Should the newcomer try to expand upon previously established conventions, or attempt to find its own identity as it travels down the tumultuous road so many others have walked before? Dark Vale Games' Forge finds middle ground, offering up an intriguing mixture of third-person shooting and fantasy role-playing, where armaments and spells are always darting right past you. You either acclimate quickly or leave in a fit of frustration, but for those who excel in frenetic environments, Forge provides an engaging explosion of frantic combat meant for mega-multitaskers.     Team Fortress 2 and Natural Selection. The game is rife with cut-and-paste fantasy elements, and the pandemonium plays out among real-world players (no bots allowed) and feels quite unhinged for those unfamiliar with its more complex elements. It confuses for the first hour or so, and for this reason, new players will flock to the series of tutorials available for first-timers.      You must at least explore the tutorials available to you in order to unlock the other modes of play, but completing the tutorials is a slog. Once you jump into the action, you find yourself annihilated by veteran players, but you learn more in this school of hard knocks than you do in the clumsy tutorial lessons. If you never explore the tutorials beyond what is required, advanced tooltips and optional educational bubbles aid you in deciphering which abilities are appropriate in different situations and how to use them. With that said, there's still a learning curve to contend with.      Once you've jumped off the deep end straight into a real match, it's quickly obvious that there's no time for practice--you either step in line with the twitch-based encounters, or you meet a swift end. Once you've battled enough, you slowly become a competent player. There are five classes to master: assassin, pathfinder, pyromancer, shaman, and warden, each with nine specific abilities. Standard fantasy skills are exhibited among these specializations, including healing magic, stuns, slowing, and other tropes. Fortunately, standout abilities, such as swapping places with a player or trapping an enemy in place by way of an arrow, give Forge an identity of its own. These varied attacks contribute to the chaotic nature of the game, and lend a fresh lilt to what could have easily stagnated as the same played-out skill trees of other fantasy games.        Each class's base attack is sufficient to secure the errant kill, but most solo efforts give way to group attacks and combined assaults to do massive amounts of damage. Long story short, simply spamming your main melee attack won't get you far in Forge. Coordinating lethal strikes with teammates is key. For this it's imperative that you communicate in both the rapid-fire 10-on-10 team battles and the face-offs that shatter into smaller scuffles here and there across the four available maps. Flipping between coordinated raids and solo altercations is satisfying, especially once you've had ample time to grow and learn with your favorite class.      Luckily, it's simple to become accustomed to the class of your choice. Forge takes a page out of the single-player shooter rule book, forgoing the familiar convention of number-keyed abilities for a clever mapping of class-specific attacks, curses, and buffs to the WASD keys. Should you require your warden to buff allies while gallivanting around the map dodging bullets, or if your shaman is called upon to heal himself or others in an immediate area, movement is not restricted to how fast your hand is able to swap between the number and WASD keys. Nimble fighters will find themselves rewarded in Forge, as the controls allow you to juggle movement and abilities with a minimum of physical fuss.      In fact, movement is paramount to success. The whole of Forge is built on this very idea, with varied terrain allowing for surprise strikes and dynamic sprints to your enemy to surprise and scare the wits out of them. There's no map to reveal your enemies' location and no indicators to keep you focusing on where your opponents might be; you simply need to stay alert and keep abreast of your enemies' attack patterns to stay alive. Sometimes you won't, and an assassin will swiftly take you out from the shadows. That's part of what makes Forge the interesting beast it can be and is one of the reasons it's a pleasant change from standard fantasy battlegrounds. This lack of situational awareness doesn't put you at a disadvantage, however, but rather enhances the experience in a way that evens the playing field.       Attaining experience points nets you new, predictable upgrades: armor, speed, health, and new abilities to slot into the gaping hole on your overlay. Putting your hard-earned experience points to proper use is a great way to blow through the ranks from rookie to seasoned Forge player, and you will notice a significant change in the way you play once standard health points have risen, or when you're unleashing that brand-new ability on an unsuspecting enemy. It feels good, and it's a great reason to keep pushing forward to get better. If you're skilled enough, you will flourish.      Forge is intriguing in many ways, breaking many stalwart conventions and remaining firmly cemented in others. The mayhem of shooters crisscrossed with magical derring-do ensure the game is nothing short of chaotic at all times. A few grayed-out modes listed in the match-type list are still unavailable, and the paucity of maps currently diminish its appeal, but Forge is already a riotous competitive experience that deserves your attention. Sometimes all you need is a little discord.    "
708,Falcon Age,8.0,2,"Having an animal retrieve something at your command is one of the great joys of being a pet owner. It's difficult to put into words. My girlfriend's daschund hardly listens and doesn't know any tricks, but when you ask him to fetch his plum-sized orange ball, he finds it, wherever it is, and brings it to your feet, tail wagging delightedly. Falcon Age, a first-person action-adventure game for PlayStation VR, understands the special fellowship that exists between a person and their pet, and it expresses beautifully the trust and affection that caring for an animal can make you feel. Besides robust combat and fine crafting, it captures that simple, precious thrill of playing fetch--and captures it so well that, after a few hours in the company of this bird, you may feel you've adopted a new pet.Falcon Age places in your charge a baby falcon whose mother is killed protecting it, and over the course of a roughly four-hour campaign you feed it, train it, nurture it, lead it into battle, and otherwise act as its full-time caretaker. This can be done conventionally, on a television and with a DualShock 4, or in virtual reality, with a PSVR headset and a pair of Move controllers (or in VR with a DualShock, if you so prefer). Falcon Age was designed expressly to be played in virtual reality, though, so the traditional, non-VR gameplay feels like something of an afterthought. It's adequate in two dimensions with familiar first-person controls, but the game's best qualities are appreciable only with the headset on and the Move controllers in your hands. If you want to really bond with your bird, you need to be able to reach out and touch it.You play as Ara, one of the few humans left on a planet ravaged by robot colonizers. As the game opens, Ara is imprisoned, forced to follow a monotonous daily loop of ""reeducation"" in the form of morning quizzes and hard labor mining ore by pickaxe outside. Soon enough, she escapes, and the story follows her efforts to adopt the ancient traditions of her near-extinct people while fighting alongside the scrappy resistance that aims to take the planet back from its unwelcome invaders. Interestingly, the story begins near what seems to be the end of the colonization; the planet has already been exhaustively ransacked for resources, and as we arrive it looks long-since despoiled. The air of late-stage devastation--evident in every bleak vista and arid valley--makes fresh a premise that might otherwise feel too familiar.It also makes clear the game's politics, which are as central to Falcon Age as the bird is. The background of the story--a sprawling, rapacious colonial superpower ransacks a planet of its valuables, strong-arming the natives into wildly unjust obedience--is obviously meant to suggest certain real-world analogues, and it's hard not to keep the historical parallels in mind when hearing this tale from the perspective of the oppressed. Even the falcon is poignant here; you're told early on that falconry is part of the traditions of the native population, rapidly disappearing under tyrannical rule. It's a simple parable, but it's relevant, and it lends the game a seriousness that belies the impression of a game about an adorable bird.As you and your falcon make your way through the desolate landscape, attacking robot outposts and learning to practice farming on the recaptured soil, you discover encampments, encounter other survivors, and, in keeping with the demands of an adventure game, meet merchants with things for you to buy and people with errands for you to complete. The world itself feels well-realized and intriguingly stark, as you chart vast plains of barren rock depleted of verdure and pitted with fixtures of sleek, ominous steel. The conversations you have with its inhabitants, on the other hand, tend jarringly slangy and sarcastic, with dialogue that clangs as oddly careless. Your hero, in particular, often talks like an angsty teenager, with options to sass in practically every exchange with other people. The snarky one-liners struck me as totally inappropriate to the setting.Communication with your feathered friend is, thankfully, much more natural--perhaps because it's entirely unspoken. For your troubles, it's at your command. The mechanics are simple, modeled on the basic techniques of falconry. Your bird's default state is airborne, circling the sky above you. Bringing a fist to your lips calls it to you, and raising a hand invites it to land on your wrist. While perched, it can be fed, stroked, played with, or tended to if wounded--more on that later. The Move controllers are very responsive to even subtle movements, and the bird AI is sharp enough that I almost never had trouble getting it to follow my commands or fly to me when needed. It feels like a natural extension of your own body in an elegant, smoothly integrated way.You can dress your bird, equip it with items and armour, and direct it toward points of interest in the environment before you. Sometimes this takes the form of a kind of problem-solving, as in certain AI-companion puzzle games such as The Last Guardian. A drawbridge out of reach can be lowered for use if you direct your falcon to cut the string holding it aloft, for instance. Other times it's a matter of getting along as partners in the wild. Your falcon will hunt animals, pick fruit from trees, or collect bits of ore for you if so instructed; stronger creatures, such as big armoured beasts who burrow in the sand, you can tackle together, taking turns striking and jockeying for advantage. While you are bereft of beak or talons, you are equipped with an electric baton and whip, which isn't too shabby. You may have to whip plates of shell off the back of a lumbering animal to expose a weak point where your falcon can swoop in.It's at robot basecamps that the hunt becomes a full-blown battle--and it's here, too, where the surprising depth of the game's combat system reveals itself. The basic strategy involves tagging enemies and standing back while your animal does his thing, but in more challenging skirmishes you're obliged to be an active, nimble participant. Your falcon can pin certain enemies in place for you to attack their weaknesses; it also relies on you, in some cases, to attack first, and it's enormously satisfying to work out the right approach to a new situation. At their most complex, these are battles of wits and reflexes--a challenge that's gratifying rather than frustrating, thanks to precise, intuitive controls with the Move setup, especially with free roam on.Like deflecting a bullet with a knife in Superhot, looking down the sights of a sniper rifle in Killing Floor Incursion, or slashing a block in half in Beat Saber, interacting with your bird in Falcon Age has a tactile pleasure that is truly satisfying. The bird itself, meanwhile, looks great, behaves believably, and feels on the whole like a coherent, fully realized character; more than a sidekick or ally, you come to think of it as a companion, like a cat or dog at home. The highest compliment I can think to pay Falcon Age is that it evoked the same feeling I get caring for my real-life pets--including the real wince of bone-deep alarm I felt anytime my bird was at risk of injury. This is about much more than a cute animal. It's about a bond, and one Falcon Age nails."
2832,The King of Fighters XIII,8.0,2,"The King of Fighters XII, which was released in 2009, looked beautiful and had a solid fighting system, but its dearth of single-player content and busted online functionally killed it for many players. Now, The King of Fighters XIII is here, and it addresses all of the issues the previous installment faced. XIII is an immensely robust game that adds a lot a new content to XII's solid mechanics, and it easily earns this series the right to stand alongside other fighting giants in the genre's spotlight.      Street Fighter III: Third Strike Online Edition. Though quicker than Third Strike, XIII shares the same fundamentals of smart positioning and timing. Positioning comes from proficiency with the game's movement options. With four types of jumps and a roll that can pass through anything but throws, it takes practice to navigate the battlefield quickly and efficiently.     When used well, these movement techniques make you feel nimble and keep the action focused on offense. You always want to be building momentum with fancy footwork and calculated strikes. But even at its most chaotic, the game still allows you time to think. There's a satisfying tension in planning your next strike or in deciding how to break the enemy's stride. XIII has its own rules of engagement, and understanding these rules--and when to break them--lets the game's personality shine. As with any strong fighter, the ebb and flow of advanced play is as much about strategy as it is about execution.   stylish. You can burn this meter to cancel certain special attacks into others or activate hyperdrive mode. In this mode, your character can link together moves and build combos that aren't otherwise possible. Finally, the guard gauge depletes as you block attacks. If you let it run out, your character enters a vulnerable crumple state--so be careful.        The entire system feels very flexible. Each character has the tools for building devastating combos and quickly navigating the field. This uniform character design also carries over to vitality. Unlike in many fighting games, characters in XIII have the same amount of health, which means an attack will deal the same amount of damage no matter whom it hits. Each character's health gauge is broken down into sections for additional clarity. Once you learn how many sections a certain combo shaves off, it's easy to see when to cash it in and finish the match.     You can test your skills in Story mode, though if you're not familiar with Elisabeth Blanctorche, Ash Crimson, or why that one guy from Fatal Fury is here, then you're going to feel a little lost. This mode lasts only a few hours, but it has multiple routes and endings. Once ""completed,"" a massive storyboard becomes available. From there, you can revisit different points in the tale and select alternate routes through it. There's also an Arcade mode that's heavier on the action and is where you can unlock the game's two secret characters.   why these moves are important. Knowing the tactical merits of a hop versus a hyperjump is just as vital as their execution. This problem not only exists in XIII, but also in fighting games in general. For combo training, XIII's combo trials are well implemented. They display their inputs clearly, as well as feature demonstrations to aid execution and timing. In addition, characters have their own Time Trial and Survival modes to further hone your skills.     All of this preparation would be for naught if it didn't support a solid online offering. Thankfully, XIII does not repeat XII's mistakes. It offers an online experience that's smooth and stable, provided you find an opponent in the three-to-four green-bar range. If you fall below that, you'll encounter noticeable (though not unplayable) performance dips. When you finish, you can choose to save that match's replay for future viewing. While it's a nice touch, there is not a system in place for sharing or viewing other's replays. Sadly, Spectator mode is also absent in online play, which leads to a lot of bored players during group games.        Whether you're online or off, the game's presentation is simply gorgeous. The 2D character sprites fill up the screen with astonishing detail, such as the way their clothing flutters. The numerous stages are equally impressive--and infinitely more detailed--featuring hordes of overly excited spectators or a pack of elephants encircling the ring. There's even a color edit mode where you can alter your fighter's color scheme to your liking. All of these features, combined with the tightly balanced fighting mechanics, make The King of Fighters XIII a fantastic game that can easily go toe-to-toe with the heavy hitters in the fighting game genre.

3354,Fallout: New Vegas,8.0,2,"more. There's more to do in New Vegas than in Fallout 3, its superb predecessor; there's more complexity to its gameplay mechanics; and there are even more secrets to uncover as you roam the postapocalyptic wastes. Fallout: New Vegas' familiar rhythm will delight fans of the series, and the huge world, expansive quests, and hidden pleasures will have you itching to see what other joys you might uncover. Occasional glitches and performance issues occasionally intrude upon your travels, along with the scorpions and geckos that might accost you. Don't let the quirks frighten you away, however: New Vegas' nooks and crannies are bursting with grimy treasures waiting to be dusted off and admired by intrepid explorers.        This latest trip into the desolate American landscape possesses many of the same elements that made Fallout 3 such a successful role-playing game, but its story doesn't boast as many memorable moments. The large-scale combat scenarios are less epic, and the surprises are less dramatic than Fallout 3's mid-game reverie. Nevertheless, the main tale provides a solid skeleton from which to hang a dumbfounding number of tasks and stand-alone parables. Many of these quests are lengthy, and great dialogue and good voice acting will invite you to learn more about the characters, as well as keep you wondering about what will happen next. A society of ghouls with pie-in-the-sky aspirations is creepy enough to make you squirm, yet blind devotion to their dreams still inspires empathy. Socialites in formal attire run a casino known for its creative menu choices, and if you play your cards right, you might get to make a menu alteration of your own. You investigate the disappearance of a sharp-tongued wife in one town and bring star-crossed lovers together in another. Some of the most fascinating occurrences are the wittier ones. During one quest, a robot with a specialized skill and a gut-busting name might offer a service that surely no game character has ever offered before. A poet in an unlikely place mumbles aloud his difficulties in finding the right rhymes. Like with Fallout 3, the greatest delights aren't in the central storyline but on its periphery.       While the tale isn't as evocative as it might have been, the way it blossoms as you advance, giving you any number of ways to proceed, is extraordinary. The choices you make might lead to a dramatically different experience from another player's experience. The same is true of many supplementary quests. There's a ton of flexibility in how you might approach certain tasks. Maybe you'll fend off the robots defending a long-forgotten museum, but you might also steal an identification card that allows you to walk around (mostly) unharmed. You might provide a drug addict his fix, but if your speech skill is high enough, you can convince him to get on the straight and narrow. One lovelorn fellow will try to send you on a scavenger hunt for spare parts, but a high science skill means you can recommend another schematic and avoid the job altogether. However, there are certain cases in which the game funnels you down a specific path that might come as a shock if you prefer peaceful ends but are forced into a combat scenario with a single viable solution. And in certain cases, the quests just aren't designed particularly well. Searching for a key in a vault overrun with vegetation can turn into a major hassle. Avoiding an artillery bombardment isn't fun in the least and feels out of place given the measured pace at which you move. And an optional quest in which you hop from one computer terminal to another to isolate a virus leads to frustrating trial-and-error guesswork.         Large personalities give an edge to your undertakings. A mysterious man known as Mr. House presides over both the Strip, as well as your own adventures, and his singular focus on fulfilling his needs looms dramatically over the later hours of your escapades. The leader of a Roman-inspired legion is also an ominous presence and a violent counterpoint to the upright and learned leader of the Brotherhood of Steel's local contingent. A ghoulish prostitute, a potty-mouthed head waiter, and a wealthy-but-desperate father all make an impression in spite of their very minor roles. You might even find an interesting kindred spirit to accompany you. As with Fallout 3, you can bring a companion along with you; this is handy not only in combat, but it also gives you an extra inventory for dumping detritus. Interacting with your companion is simple, thanks to a wheel that lets you choose behaviors for your fellow traveler. You can only have one at a time, but you'll encounter multiple individuals willing to join you, and they all make interesting and funny quips when you interact with them. They also open up different quest opportunities, giving you a chance to learn more about what makes them tick.      Fallout: New Vegas' major addition is that of faction favor. You establish a reputation with various towns and organizations by doing them favors or annoying them in some way or another. Which factions you align with has both subtle and profound consequences. If you're liked, a random somebody might run up to you bearing minor gifts, such as an iguana on a stick. (Mmm, tasty.) Or if you've gained a more violent reputation, a mugger might accost you with violent intentions, only to run off when he recognizes you. It's a pleasure to hear random citizens remark on how they feel about you as you pass by, even if the canned comments repeat a bit too often. (It's sometimes bizarre to hear two characters standing side by side deliver the same line, spoken by the same voice actor.)         Your faction relationships also have much more dramatic consequences on your adventure, opening up new quests while closing off others. The game is sometimes a bit opaque regarding how your actions may inadvertently affect the way a particular faction sees you, but this complexity manifests itself in awesome ways as you near the end of your travels. One great twist to this system is that by dressing up in faction-specific clothing or armor, you can disguise yourself and avoid a confrontation. Though, conversely, you might get dragged into battles against allies if you forget to change gear, which might damage a relationship you're trying to cultivate. This reputation system is a bit abstract, but it's a great addition to the Fallout formula, adding even more layers to a template already lauded for its flexibility.       Glitches may give you a few minor fits, but the PC version of Fallout: New Vegas is not in the same rough technical shape as its console counterparts, possibly thanks to a sizeable patch delivered a day after its release. That doesn't mean there aren't problems here. We encountered some bugs, such as a friendly quest giver inexplicably attacking us, even though he didn't show as an enemy on the directional radar.  Characters might still randomly freak out as if you're about to attack for no discernible reason, only to return to their normal locations a moment later and act as if nothing had happened. But we encountered only a few scripting problems, and the game never crashed. Most complex role-playing games suffer from technical hitches, and this one is no exception. However, the oddities in this version aren't exceptionally disruptive, which makes it easy to stay invested.      Fallout 3 or The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, which used the same game engine as Fallout: New Vegas, then you won't be surprised by some of the other minor foibles, although many of them seem exacerbated here. Characters get easily stuck on the environment and run in place, for example. There are also occasional pauses as you explore this gigantic world, and the frame rate tends to drop somewhat when there are multiple characters on the screen at once. Nevertheless, striking lighting, smoother edges, better overall performance, and shorter loading times than on consoles make Fallout: New Vegas on the PC stand tall. The game evokes a great sense of place in which the postapocalyptic future meets the recent past. Your first glimpse of the neon-lit Strip at night will have you pausing to take it all in, after all those hours of traversing the bleak wastelands. This isn't a pretty game, exactly, but it delivers a world you can believe in and is consistent with Fallout lore. Swirling dust storms cloud your view, crumbling edifices demand to be scavenged for simple treasures, and spore-spewing monsters hide in tufts of green overgrowth. When you see an interesting building or installation in the distance, you're always inspired to check it out, and more often than not, there's something interesting awaiting you.      The audio also contributes to the grimness of your travels, though it shares some idiosyncrasies with Fallout 3. There are radio stations to listen to, and while the toe-tapping tunes evoke Vegas through and through, hearing the same small selection of songs gets old fast. The main soundtrack is improved over Fallout 3's, using twisted twangs to summon images of cowboys roaming the blighted wilderness, driving two-headed Brahman instead of traditional cattle. Many of the symphonic swells, on the other hand, would have been more appropriate in a fantasy game. But the sound effects usually scratch the proper itch, especially where combat is concerned. A sawed-off shotgun produces a lot of oomph, and the satisfying thwacks of a rebar club make it a satisfying go-to weapon. But while the guns and sledgehammers make a big impression, subtler effects, such as the deep rumbles that indicate a quest completed, are just as satisfying.         The muffled splats you hear when you activate the Vault-Tec Automated Targeting System (aka VATS) also make an impression. Though you can aim down your iron sights, slow controls and stiff animations still make for slightly awkward real-time gunplay. Luckily, entering VATS and targeting your enemy's limbs leads to all the same rewarding, slow-motion splatters of blood and irradiated goo that made Fallout 3 such a brutal blast. The returning ""bloody mess"" perk may not have much gameplay significance, but it does result in limbs, heads, and other viscera flying through the air, which is often both gratifying and hysterical. Many of your creepy returning opponents are the usual suspects: supermutants, radscorpions, and the like. Others are new but equally enjoyable to fight, such as the nightkins, which are hideous mutants that cloak themselves using stealth-boy devices. You fight a lot of human enemies as well. Those battles might affect your standing with one faction or another and often pit you against named characters that might have had quests to offer or dialogue to deliver had you aligned yourself differently. As a result, some skirmishes have more impact than Fallout 3's less meaningful encounters versus nameless brigands.      When you aren't out fighting foes or questing for the greater good (or to the detriment of all humanity), you might want to try your hand at a bit of gambling. Outside of the casinos, you can play a fun little card game called Caravan with various individuals, which takes a bit of time to learn but might get you addicted to purchasing cards to add to your deck. Once you make it to Vegas proper, you can cash in bottle caps or faction-specific currency for chips and play some blackjack or roulette or maybe plunk a few coins into the slot machines. These games are much as you'd expect, but the slick presentation makes them enjoyable and addictive all the same. If you'd rather stay focused on more traditional role-playing tasks, you could always head to a work bench to create some ammo from raw materials or apply a weapon upgrade. Or perhaps you'd rather use a campfire to cook up some healthful items from the monster bits you've gathered. It's nice that the game gives recipe enthusiasts something to do, though the prevalence of weapons, armor, and aid items mean you can safely ignore these elements if you prefer.         Fallout: New Vegas is an expansive and complicated RPG that encourages you to see and do as much as you can. This is an explorer's game, always lavishing new and interesting quests on you and giving you a lot of flexibility in how you approach many of them. It builds upon Fallout 3's mechanics in interesting and esoteric ways, making it a comfortable evolution to one of 2008's best games. A few glitches and performance issues occasionally let it down, yet Fallout: New Vegas is periodically awesome and often compelling. If you crave an expansive and flexible adventure in which your choices actually matter, this is one gamble that will pay off.      "
128,Signalis,8.0,2,"They say everything old is new again, and that's definitely been the case for survival-horror games lately. Full remakes, remasters, and reboots have made the headlines in one of gaming's more underserved genres, with no end in sight. So it's been an exciting change of pace to play Signalis, which is blatantly inspired by landmark franchises like Silent Hill and Resident Evil, but offers its own original horror universe to explore.Signalis doesn't look exactly like the games that inspired it, but it only takes a short while before a veteran of the genre knows what they're in for. The top-down 2D pixel art isn't a precise callback to its spiritual predecessors, nor is its lack of voice acting, but as soon as you start finding door unlock codes on the back of photos you investigate in your inventory screen, memories of the Raccoon City Police Department or Brookhaven Hospital will inevitably come flooding back.As its protagonist, the robotic LSTR (pronounced Elster), moves through darkened hallways and abandoned dorm rooms set aboard a futuristic space vessel seeking habitable planets for its dystopian ""Nation"" to conquer; she walks, runs, aims, and carries a gun just like Jill Valentine or another horror alum of the PS1 era. Searching behind every door that isn't ""jammed on the other side"" for her missing human companion, the story unfolds in a way you've likely seen before--as though you're perpetually falling into a world you might not be prepared for, but you can't turn back.As a horror fan, I found it atmospheric and intoxicating, and it's often aided by the work of clever audio designers who know when not to fill the space with noise, and who have picked a pitch-perfect safe room song that somehow sounds soothing and spooky at once. Like Silent Hill 2, you'll even descend into several gaping holes in the world with no foresight of what might await you on the other side. Callbacks like these, which help form its original story in established territory, are subtle references, but other nods are more obvious.It's a game where you encounter monsters in hallways with barely any room to run past them, hardly enough ammo to take them down, and seldom a clue as to where you need to go next. But, like the genre's titans, the devil is always in the details, and the game rewards a cautious but ultimately decisive playstyle. It doesn't take long to learn that evading enemies is usually better than pumping your only few bullets into them, and even when you must resort to combat, you'll want to burn the bodies with flares, or else watch as they eventually come back to life to haunt you once more.Managing your limited inventory space means prepping for the immediate moments when you leave a safe room, because with just six slots to wrestle with, you won't want to discard precious ammo in order to store a quest item, such as an odd key or a mysterious stone tablet, so it makes no sense to pack for the long haul. With a bit of progress, you'll find respite in another safe room.Whenever a puzzle would halt my progress, it always felt like I was just overlooking something. Maybe it was a note in my inventory that hinted at the keycode I lacked. Maybe it was an item I hadn't found yet because a back alley of assailants stood in my way. Thanks to the game's helpful map display, which tracks quest items and puzzle areas in familiar but subtly more detailed ways, I was often lost figuratively, but never literally. I always had a rough idea of what I needed to do, which makes the puzzles feel fairer than many of those we've seen in games like this.In this way, Signalis builds on the games it strives to evoke without betraying their vital way of scrambling your brain. That sense of confusion is key to creating the feeling that the walls are closing in around you, like you don't know where to turn for safety and you're doomed to walk the halls with the dead forever. Signalis proves that an experience can still be tense without being indecipherable.To the seasoned horror player, these experiences are surely familiar, but because they're executed well and supplemented by an engrossing slow-burning story and universe, I find Signalis, in most ways, comfortably stands among the games its two-person team so blatantly adore. When you're not finding clues in notes or objects, you're often learning new lore regarding Signalis' futuristic dystopia, where civil wars, a humanoid-robot working class, and the occult collide to present a world that feels steeped in history even as you'll see so little of it as Elster. Aided by an unnerving lofi soundtrack, the game's story and atmosphere land as some of its best, most original feats, and help Signalis stand out more than its purposely tropey puzzles and combat do.Signalis is owed plenty of praise for all of these stated reasons, though it's not without faults. Its third-person aiming mechanics can get frustrating at times, as even the soft auto-aim feature on by default is too liable to miss--a save-scum-worthy error when ammo is so low. Maybe this is the game's way of also mimicking the faulty combat controls of the genre's progenitors, but to me it just comes off as inadvertently clunky.Still, it does wind up instilling some fear in the game, which you may be surprised to learn is actually generally lacking. I've called the game tense and unnerving, and it is certainly both of those things, but I've not called it scary because, unfortunately, it isn't. I think that particular distinction matters a lot. In tight quarters, enemies will raise your heart rate, but it stems from a will to not reload a save, not from the enemies' ability to actually scare. Perhaps more than most elements of games, this attribute is highly subjective, but I do expect other similarly versed horror players will agree. I'm tense when I can't find my wallet. I'm unnerved by getting my picture taken. Being scared is something different, and though I love Signalis for so much of what it does well, it never does feel scary.But Signalis is great in spite of its lack of true scares and deserves to be played by anyone who enjoys games like it. I've enjoyed many horror movies and books that don't scare me because I like the subject matter, the settings, the characters, or some other elements of them, and the same can be true for games. Signalis isn't a scary horror game, but it is a memorable one that borrows from the past while helping secure a future for games like this--and the small but talented team, with any luck. For me, atmospheric, tense, and creepy are adequate stand-ins for true horror, and Signalis has plenty to offer along those lines."
2622,Iron Front: Liberation 1944,2.0,0,"   ARMA and Battlefield 1942. There's a thick coating of realism, alongside a kitchen sink full of possibilities. You start off as a simple soldier, but ultimately you can do everything from manning heavy weapons to commanding tanks to flying fighter aircraft. Sniping, stealth, huge frontal assaults: everything’s included. Iron Front: Liberation 1944 is highly ambitious in scope, but ends up trying to do way too much. The ground portions do feel somewhat realistic (at least in the sense that you can die and kill instantly), but the opaque control system makes flying a plane cumbersome and inorganic.     To its credit, the game offers dialogue in both German and Russian (subtitled) or in horribly dubbed English, if reading isn't your bag. The thing is, regardless of the language you choose, you won't care what anyone is saying. Apart from the occasional stultifying cutscene in which you listen to a narrator read text that's already visible onscreen, most dialogue in the game is AI-generated radio babble that comes so fast and furious, and is so poorly tracked on your heads-up display, that it may as well be a TV left on in the background. Iron Front tries hard to give you a feeling of being one part of a much larger battle, but because the briefings interface is totally obtuse, and because the way information comes at you in missions is so confusing, the interface overwhelms both you and itself.       In fact, the entire game overwhelms itself. During the review process, Iron Front received a large patch that fixed some (but by no means all) of its stability issues. Yet in spite of the patch, the game still crashes, just not as often. Other bugs have revealed themselves since: loading screens frequently hang, necessitating forced quits; controls stop responding mid-mission for no apparent reason; AI entities stand around doing absolutely nothing while receiving effective incoming fire; and sound suddenly cuts out or goes extremely quiet in the middle of critical briefings. AI pathfinding is also a huge issue, with non-player characters frequently getting lost or trapped on geometry, and enemies patrolling in endless circles, doing nothing of importance.        As if the technical issues weren't enough, it becomes immediately clear when you begin a real mission that Iron Front is completely overwhelmed with feature creep. All sorts of small arms are, ostensibly, realistically modeled, along with vehicles, heavy weapons, airplanes, you name it. But the game tries to cram realistic performance for all of these things into its limited controls, creating a morass of impenetrable key bindings that are impossible to memorize and even harder to implement when someone is shooting at you. Why, for example, is there a separate key for ""stand up""? Why can't you simply hit the ""crouch"" or ""prone"" button again? Conversely, double-tapping the forward button to sprint is extremely clumsy, especially since your sprinting speed is so similar to your normal movement speed that it's hard to tell at times if you've even started sprinting successfully.          Let's say you manage to look past all this and struggle through Iron Front's interminable tutorial levels to get to actual missions; you only have complete chaos to look forward to, because enemy AI is completely moronic, allies are useless, and death will randomly hit you with no warning whatsoever. You might be walking along a friendly runway in your HQ during the first 10 seconds of a mission, about to climb into the cockpit of a Focke-Wulf 190, only to be summarily laid out by God knows what in the middle of your own base. Was it an enemy bomber? A piece of shrapnel? Friendly fire? A sniper? It doesn't really matter--have fun looking at another loading screen while the entire mission resets.      Multiplayer offers little respite, although at least you don't have to deal with much in the way of AI idiocy. Still, almost all players of Iron Front appear to be located in Europe, so pings from the US, particularly the Western US, are absolutely awful. If you do get into a decent game, you better know how to speak German, because the guys you're playing with most likely do. But don't worry, you won't have to listen to them for too long--games crash, lag out, or unceremoniously kick you out on a regular basis. On the rare occasion you do get to play through a match, you spend most of your time sneaking about, encountering nary an enemy, and getting totally owned by someone you never see.        Alternatively, you're on the other side of this: you creep up on some poor soul who has no idea what's going on because Iron Front hates clarity, and you equip your Mosin-Nagant rifle, hunt for that one button that makes you look through the scope rather than the iron sights, press it, line up your target in the period-appropriate crosshairs, and then restart Windows because you've been kicked to the desktop, and your mouse cursor has disappeared.     Iron Front is unfinished. Playing through a game, even with some of the bugs squashed, gives you a sense of confusion more than anything else. More patches may be on the way to shore up what there is of Iron Front, but as it stands now, you're better off avoiding these perilous battlefields.     "
4715,Bet on Soldier: Blood Sport,3.0,0,"  Bet on Soldier is a sci-fi-themed first-person shooter that takes place in a crazy war-torn world where the primary form of televised entertainment is one-on-one gladiatorial battles that break out in the middle of an otherwise normal battle. While that might sound like just the sort of gameplay and plot hook that might drag in all of you people waiting patiently for a game based on The Running Man, Bet on Soldier is a collection of half-baked ideas wrapped in a buggy mess of an engine, and the end result is a very bad game, overall.        Each mission begins with a soldier loadout screen where you can purchase weapons, various types of armor, and mercenaries to assist you along the way. You'll also choose which champions you'd like to face in each mission. This is where the whole Bet on Soldier concept comes into play. When you encounter these champions, the game breaks into a cutscene that plays the intro of a TV show called Bet on Soldier. These battles are treated like a televised sport, but they boil down to your trying to win as quickly as possible to earn more money. The solo battles are dull and fairly lifeless, plus they're jarring and intrude on the rest of the game.     The rest of the game is all about keeping your armor in good working order. You can do this by using conveniently placed reload and repair terminals, but this costs you money. Thankfully, you earn cash for every kill, and unless you're horrible at shooting people in the head--which is pretty easy here since the artificial intelligence doesn't seem to understand the concept of finding good cover--you'll always have plenty of money to work with. Alternately, you can hire an engineer to come with you. He can repair you at any time, but his light armor means you'll have to protect him. Since the mercenary AI is only marginally smarter than the enemy AI, this isn't always easy. We ran into several occasions when our backup got hung up on a wall and wouldn't proceed until we ran back through half the level to get him unstuck.     Armor is more than just a number near your health bar. Bet on Soldier also gives you a large metal riot shield, which you can put out in front of you when using a one-handed weapon. It slows you down a bit, but considering you can just as easily get headshots with a pistol as with a scoped rifle, the pistol is plenty powerful. Anyone with a steady hand should be able to nail headshots from great distances, since the enemies tend to stand still when you aren't directly in front of them.     In addition to its dreary, repetitive single-player game, Bet on Soldier has a multiplayer component that attempts to bring the betting in by letting you place ""bets"" on your ability to take out specific enemy soldiers. It's also a class-based mode that lets you upgrade through multiple levels by spending money. Unfortunately, the combat itself isn't exciting, so all of this is fairly moot. Also, finding more than one or two servers running at once is rare, so don't expect to find a great deal of online competition.     While it's not a particularly compelling game even when it's running properly, Bet on Soldier is also dragged down by a series of nasty technical issues that aren't fixed by the game's version 1.2 patch, including one that caused the game to crash to desktop every time we tried to start a game, change the resolution, or do just about anything else. On a different but similarly outfitted machine, the game ran without crashing, but it was prone to seizing up for seconds at a time. And the long load times' static or black screens had us wondering if maybe the game had crashed anyway, and then it would finally start up a minute or two later.        Once it's up and running, Bet on Soldier does have some decent graphics. The player models are at least technically impressive and it makes good use of lighting and shadow effects, even if the design side of the game's visuals leave something to be desired. It's a proficient but bland-looking game that never seems to run at a stable frame rate, even on a machine that well exceeds the recommended system requirements. The speech in Bet on Soldier is a source of hilarious unintentional comedy. Imagine a native French speaker learning English from someone with a British accent and then attempting to sound like a hard-ass general from Texas. The constant accent shifts occur not only from sentence to sentence, but even word to word in some cases. It's completely insane, and it's one of the few compelling things about the game. Beyond that, the music is lackluster, and the basic sound effects are pretty bad. The scraping metal sound that plays when you walk is supposed to invoke the sound of a heavily armored trooper on the move. Instead it's just grating. You're also constantly panting and wheezing like an asthmatic. Considering you're supposed to be a trained soldier and the best of the best, carrying all that armor around shouldn't make you sound like you're constantly about to collapse.     It's buggy, it's ill-conceived, and it's even totally unplayable on some systems in its current state. If you think Bet on Soldier is a recipe for a game worth skipping, you're exactly right.  "
2861,Cities XL 2012,6.0,1,"Cities XL 2011, with only some new buildings and maps added to the feature set. While the publisher is making no secret that this is more of an expansion than a full-blown sequel and is offering an upgrade to owners of last year's game for $15, there still isn't enough fresh content to warrant a purchase.        If you're familiar with Cities XL 2011, then surprise, you're already familiar with Cities XL 2012. This is pretty much the same game, albeit with around 300 new buildings (a mostly cosmetic change that gives neighborhoods a revamped look with things like deluxe waterfront homes) and 15 new maps on which to ply your city-building talents. The heart of the game still beats exactly as it did last year. You play virtual mayor of a budding burg on maps that represent terrain of all types found in every corner of the globe. Just about everything you could imagine is represented here, from fertile valleys and deserts to rocky wastelands and island paradises. Each comes with fairly distinct challenges that mostly involve how to best manipulate the terrain and how to deal with resource shortages in crucial areas like water and oil. As with the earlier games in the series, there is no campaign here. Instead, you freely go from one map to the next and develop cities that coexist as part of a shared global economy. So even though you're not following any sort of storyline, you are building cities that can work together.    SimCity 4 back in 2003. You have godlike control over every aspect of urban planning, which allows you the freedom to lay down residential, commercial, and industrial zones where homes, offices, factories, stores, and the like automatically pop up as soon as the dust clears. While you do construct some specific buildings, like schools, police stations, and high-rise hotels, most of the time, you're drawing huge runs of city blocks that soon become home to apartment buildings and Dunder Mifflin-styled office complexes. So, build it and they will come. There are some complications that mainly have to do with the need to build different housing for unskilled, skilled, executive, and elite working classes, as well as balance standard residential houses with denser developments, such as townhouses, apartments, and condos, as your city grows. Regardless, you couldn't ask for more of a no-nonsense economic system.     Cartoonish graphics with laid-back sound effects and music add to the easygoing atmosphere. Neighborhoods are attractive, but they're so neat and clean that they come off as unrealistic. Lawns are all perfectly manicured, and there isn't a scrap of litter to be found anywhere, let alone something truly scarring to the urban landscape, like graffiti. If you zoom down to street level, you can spot your bulbous citizens doing things like dancing on park benches and even possibly playing hacky sack. Audio effects include a basic range of urban noises along with building-specific sounds like what has to be the world's oldest dot-matrix printer churning away whenever you click on an office building. Soundtrack tunes are an impressively diverse series of cool jazz tracks that give the game a lot of personality. This isn't quite elevator music, although some of the songs make Steely Dan sound like The Sex Pistols.        As simple as the economic system here is, you still face some challenges when managing your city. Your citizens want good return on their tax dollars and have the audacity to demand amenities. These include jobs, reasonable health care, and safe neighborhoods covered by police stations and fire departments, as well as recreational opportunities like bowling alleys and swimming pools. You have to keep the people pleased or they will move away, leaving businesses without employees and you with dropping tax revenue. Everything is quite well balanced, though. Serious pitfalls are few and far between so that you are free to build some spectacular municipalities after a short time with the game. Unlike many other city-builder games, there are no big gotcha moments, where the game design breaks down over buildings that don't work, neighborhoods that residents can never seem to escape to find a job even though there are a dozen factories just a few blocks away, and so forth.      A smooth, intuitive interface keeps things humming. Although the icons are tiny and the text on some of them so small as to be unreadable when running at high resolutions, the overall presentation is straightforward enough for you to find your way around with ease. Construction options are never more than a couple of clicks away, and important city information regarding taxes, resources, and the like are also immediately accessible. The game comes with a lengthy series of tutorials, but you don't really need to bother with them. Little tips are constantly offered up to let you know when there are shortages of homes for specific classes of workers, when resources are so low that basics of life are being rationed, or when you need to set up some more factories to reduce unemployment. There isn't enough advice posted in these tips to walk you through the game, although this guidance holds your hand just enough so you soon figure out what to anticipate.        Still, Cities XL 2012 is not without its faults. Resource shortages are the biggest issue. It can be tough to just build a one-off city because the game pretty much forces you to connect multiple towns into trading networks. Many maps are bereft of vital resources, such as water and oil. These valuables become increasingly necessary once your population goes over 50,000 and you need to get high-skilled manufacturing and high-tech industries going. You may be cruising along with overjoyed citizens and zero unemployment but then run into shortages and have everything crash down around your head. So if you can't harvest this stuff locally, you need to bring it in either by trading with yourself courtesy of the other cities that you've created or by dealing with a gouge-happy AI corporation. And this is a real hassle. Most of the time, all you want to do is focus on one city, without having to worry about developing a half-dozen cities or more purely for the ability to schlep oil across the globe or messing with the patently fake AI trader. The concept doesn't even make sense because it treats cities like little independent nations that aren't tied to state/provincial and federal governments. The trading mechanism seems to have been unwisely held over from the days when Cities XL had a massively multiplayer component that forced human players to wheel and deal. Now that this aspect of the game has been jettisoned, it's time to ditch this unwieldy trading feature.     Another smaller problem has to do with the basic structure of the map scenarios. Every map sees you starting off from scratch with little more than basic road layouts and then working your way into the future as your population grows. This is a tried-and-true way to structure a city-building game, but it can also be boring. Even though the terrain varies considerably from map to map, you still find yourself repeatedly building the same town and dealing with the exact same issues. You can only build so many fire stations and so many shopping districts before you start wishing that Godzilla or a natural disaster would take care of your whiny citizens. Progression is totally linear as well. You plug forward until you hit population milestones, whereupon new buildings and options become available. So if you've got 49, 999 people in town, forget about putting up that middle school. If you clock 50,000, though, you can start hiring teachers. Even though this system works well, it is also incredibly arbitrary and really reinforces the notion that you're going through the same motions with your cities, whether you're building them in barren scrub or along a gorgeous tropical shoreline.        Even though Cities XL 2012 is nothing more than a fixer-upper with some fairly serious limitations, it remains a reasonable bet for virtual urban planners who have yet to experience this franchise in all of its glory. It doesn't break any new ground, but it covers a lot of the city-building bases, is more modern than its most recent SimCity competitor, and, as such, comes with a fair number of strong points to offset the weak. If you have last year's model, however, this upgrade is a questionable buy given the limited number of extras tossed into the mix.   "
2615,Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock,4.0,0,"Doctor Who skin.      Doctor Who fashion, with the Doctor--who's modeled on and voiced by actor Matt Smith--crashing the TARDIS on Earth and puzzling over the cause. It's your job to find out what went wrong and ultimately save the universe. Initial sections of the game are promising as you guide the Doctor around the Bank of England's underground vaults and as Smith delivers the Doctor's eccentric quips with a suitably tongue-in-cheek quality: ""Who designed this place? Escher?"" There are opportunities to play as River Song too (Alex Kingston). In a particularly noteworthy sequence, River sneaks past unwary guards by kissing them with hallucinogenic lipstick--a rare mix of stealth and feminine wiles.     But it's not long before the cracks begin to show. One of the game's biggest problems lies in the ham-fisted design of the various puzzles. First, there are those that mix nominal explanation with sadistic checkpoints. They involve a lot of running around not knowing what to do, but with none of the fun that accompanies such hijinks on the show. The worst offender involves a four-story building, the Cybermen army, and a security room. You have to escape the building, but first you must unlock the exit. This requires breaking into a seemingly impenetrable security room on the top floor. The only way to get in is to wait for the Cybermen to climb all four floors of stairs.      Infuriatingly, the tin men slog upstairs like geriatric Daleks, leaving you to twiddle your thumbs for three whole minutes. This isn't even the worst part, because it's anything but obvious how you're supposed to get rid of the Cybermen hordes you were forced to let reach the room. Since you have little health and lots of enemies to contend with, you'd think the game might help you out with a hint, but no dice. As a result, this puzzle will likely take several retries, and here's the kicker: every retry sends you right back to the start, meaning you have to endure those three minutes of nothingness each time you die. Every single time.         Beyond absurd checkpoints and a lack of help, that puzzle and others like it expose some basic design flaws. If a game includes full-screen minigames while insta-death enemies are around, it's only fair for it to let you know when those enemies are getting close. If a game forces you to run away, it should indicate where the insta-death enemies are. These aren't exactly subtle mistakes. Other puzzles, such as crate pushing and weight balancing, are lifted straight from Puzzle Platformer Design 101, and the Doctor's sluggish dragging animations completely destroy the pacing of the game. There are stealth puzzles too, which involve pressing L2 to duck and knowing how to time a run, but these are just as dull.   Who factor. After all, the platforming physics are graceful enough, the minigames (which spin familiar but cute twists on everything from Pipe Mania to dominoes) are as fine as they are simple when there are no enemies around, and there are a lot of collectible hats to find. In some ways, The Eternity Clock gets close.    Doctor Who spirit. River, for example, leaves the Doctor's sonic screwdriver somewhere in Victorian London for him to then find in Future London. This sequence pans out in single-player too but with you playing both parts one after another. Working with a friend in tandem better captures the time-traveling show's character.       Doctor Who glaze. The only things that distinguish each time period you visit are how it looks and which monsters are in it. There's none of the cultural exploration that's in the show's DNA, just as there's no resonance or tension within the storyline. Doctor Who is so popular because it mixes family fun with elegant sci-fi and emotional plots. Meanwhile, The Eternity Clock tosses in some funny Doctor lines, the occasional ""Hey sweetie"" from River, and a bunch of baddies, and gives it all a stir and hopes you enjoy the vaguely Doctor Who-flavored cocktail.      Maybe that will be enough for some to get over The Eternity Clock's numerous problems, but it could have been so much better. The few times banter clicks between the Doctor and River it clicks so well that you don't care that they're side-scrolling sprites. When the game actually incorporates the show's identity into the play, like River snogging guards or the level that literally makes you keep your eyes on the Silence at all times, it's as imaginative as it is true to its roots. That's what's so frustrating about The Eternity Clock. It could have been the great Doctor Who game. Sadly, beyond the promising opening minutes, it has been executed so poorly that not even the Doctor can rescue it.  "
1076,Ken Follett's The Pillars of the Earth,7.0,2,"Based on Ken Follet's 1989 novel of the same name, this adventure game gives you control of two characters with intertwining stories. The first of which is Philip, an abbey Prior who's more or less responsible for a war between two English settlements. Philip, while sometimes unsure of himself, is portrayed as a considerate, mindful character. His counterpart is Jack, a child who's grown up off the grid, living in a cave with only his mother. Jack is far less sure of himself and, at the encouragement of his mother, hardly trusts the world around him.Following these two characters is a highlight of The Pillars of the Earth, seeing the way their stories eventually come together and influence one another. But it's the story at large and its cast of secondary characters that make this world worth inhabiting. Each environment, scene, and character also has their own unique, hand-painted look to them, often with grand senses of scale and depth.Set in the 12th century, The Pillars Of The Earth tackles plot points both grandiose and granular. After King Henry I of England dies without a set heir, his nephew and daughter feud over which of them should take his place. This clash causes turmoil in England, leading to eventual wars. And while political strife makes up a lot of the overarching story, The Pillars Of The Earth isn't afraid to dive deeper into its characters, showing quiet, intimate moments where, for example, Jack learns about his upbringing or Philip writes letters to his brother. The dichotomy between these two layers keeps you--for the most part--intrigued along the way.A large cast of unique characters fleshes out this tale, adding secondary layers of motivation to the game's story. Within the first few minutes, you meet all of the the monks at Kingsbridge cathedral, where Philip has been named Prior. Each of them has a unique relationship with Philip, and it's your job to navigate their conversations and form alliances whenever possible. Furthermore, Jack's uncertainty about the world combines with his childhood curiosity. These moments are helped along with strong voice acting and a wonderful script that's packed with emotion.And yet despite the interesting characters and stories that await, it's still difficult to wholeheartedly recommend Pillars of the Earth. While it's certainly not uncommon for adventure games to forego action for narrative, The Pillars of the Earth moves at a snail's pace. There is drama, but little in the way of tangible tension.And unfortunately, there are a slew of technical issues to contend with along the way. Loading new environments often slows the framerate down to a chug (on Xbox One), and characters would sometimes talk over one another, making it difficult to follow either line of dialogue. The game also enters a load screen nearly every time it plays a new scene, which is a lot. For a game with an already slow pace, this can really hinder a lot of interest as you're forced to sit through extra screens and endure poor framerates just to get to the next story beat.It'll be interesting to see how The Pillars of the Earth evolves over its next two episodes. As of right now, it's crafted a fascinating story full of great characters. It might not be a game for everyone as it deliberately chooses to take its time getting to the point. However, if you enjoy gripping dramas, and don't mind sitting still for a bit, The Pillars of the Earth will reward your patience with the beginning of what appears to be a fascinating tale."
4664,Toshinden Subaru,3.0,0,"Ah, Toshinden - the ultimate example of a game that was in the right place at the right time. Now it is becoming less and less relevant as time marches on. While the first game played decently - and looked great - the sequels have not improved on it significantly, and Toshinden Subaru is no exception. Most everyone who was around for the PlayStation's launch, in any country, played Toshinden. It looked great - way better than anything on the Saturn. It was instantly popular, and was deemed so important to the US launch that Sony itself licensed and published it. As the PS wore on, Playmates Interactive, the now-defunct publisher of the second and third games in the US, brought us Tamsoft's increasingly irrelevant efforts. Fast forward to 1999 and a fourth Toshinden makes the scene - instead of having a name as prosaic as ""Toshinden 4,"" it's been christened Toshinden Subaru, after the main character, who is the son of Eiji, the main character of the previous Toshinden games.  Eiji has turned evil, it seems, and left his son a legacy of fighting style, burning spirit, and spiky hair. Kayin's adoptive daughter, Naru, has grown up blond and violent, just like her father, who was always Ken to Eiji's Ryu. She and Subaru team up and enter the arena with their green-haired cohort Rook. While his origins remain unclear, it is possible that he's the son of Ellis, also from the previous Toshinden games. For whatever reason - maybe because it was a trendy thing to do and Tekken had done it first - this game takes place several years after the last one in the series, and you'll be playing as either the offspring of the original characters or as their new young friends. For some other totally inexplicable reason - maybe the popularity of King of Fighters or Virtua Fighter 3tb - the story mode is team-only and you must play in groups of three. Now, it hardly needs to be said that what had worked in 1994 doesn't always work these days. The unresponsive control of Toshinden was more forgivable when 3D games were a novelty - and the graphics were the best around. Now the graphics are decidedly mediocre, and we have much better examples of 3D fighting gameplay available. Instead of moving along with the times, Tamsoft has stuck to the roots it had laid down in the original game, and that means that Subaru does not play well.The control is awkward. There's a lot of delay between what you're trying to do and what your character does. There is much that is excessively powerful or, conversely, utterly ineffectual about the special and super moves. Some moves manage to do both, depending on where the other fighter is when you attack. What seemed innovative - dodging on the L1 and L2 buttons - seems limiting these days; with the advent of other games' much freer motile capabilities, a slow roll out of the way just doesn't seem particularly useful. Slow and unresponsive is basically the best way to sum this game up. In terms of control, there must be at least twenty better PS fighters, both 2D and 3D. As with gameplay, Tamsoft has failed to bring the graphics of Toshinden into the present day. While there are some artistic touches - elements of the character models look nice, and some of the texture maps are extremely well done - in general, the graphics are blocky and unattractive. The characters are squat and chubby, and their faces look terrible. The backgrounds range from tacky and overdone to utilitarian and unadorned. There is not a single truly attractive moment in this game. Where the graphics go, so goes the music - it's hard even to notice it. The game also sports, without a doubt, the longest loading times yet of a PlayStation fighting game. Sure, the voice samples are good, there's a nice anime opening, the character designs are interesting, the plot is involved, if clich&amp;eacute;... it just doesn't add up to anything substantial when the main parts of the game are so subpar. The truth is that no matter how much work is put into a mediocre fighting game, it stays mediocre, and nothing can save it. The developers obviously cared about this game, the Toshinden characters, their offspring and the motivations behind what they do. Unfortunately, it is impossible for anyone else but the most enthusiastic fans of the series to do so."
3528,Backbreaker,6.0,1,"       The suffocating camera is just the beginning of Backbreaker's problems. Just like the zoomed-in view tries to replicate the feeling of being on the field, the passing system puts you in the shoes of the quarterback like no other game, but it doesn't translate into a fun experience. When you snap the ball, you are locked on to just one receiver, and to switch to a different target you need to push a button or the right stick (depending on your control scheme) to toggle through your options. Although this is an interesting idea in theory, forcing you to read the defense and go through all your receivers to find someone who's open, in practice it just leads to a lot of sacks. It takes so long for QBs to release the ball after you hit the pass button that you have no time to cycle through your targets to find the best option. And even when you're just focusing on one receiver, you still find yourself on the wrong end of a sack far too often because the offensive line stinks, which strips away much of the appeal of playing as a gunslinger.        Backbreaker continues to frustrate even if you find an open receiver and successfully get off a pass before the defense flattens you. Quarterbacks are horrifically inaccurate. Even if your feet are set and you're throwing just a few yards down the field, the ball will still frequently sail far wide of your intended target. It's absolutely maddening when a routine play turns into an unforced incompletion. This issue is compounded by the defense's knack for picking off passes. If you build your offense around passing (which is advisable considering how awful the running game is), it's not surprising to find your interceptions creeping dangerously close to double digits, resulting in a disjointed game in which no lead is secure and clock-eating drives are a rarity. It's also impossible to know where the ball will end up once it's released. In the actual sport, quarterbacks lead receivers before they break on a route. But oftentimes in Backbreaker, the QB throws where the receiver is instead of where he's running to, which adds another hurdle to completing a pass.          Boom that bellows during every kickoff becomes grating before the first half even ends.        There aren't any licensed teams or players in Backbreaker, but you can create your own if you want to import the NFL experience into this game. Unfortunately, even after you christen the San Francisco team with the name 49ers and drape the players in red and gold uniforms, the dumb artificial intelligence and incompetent referees still make it obvious that this is a far cry from the real thing. Players have very poor field awareness. Receivers run out of bounds of their own volition after a catch, and defenders line up offsides as if they are unaware of the rules. Coaches make just as many dumb mistakes. The computer has worse clock management than even Andy Reid, calling time-outs at inopportune moments or running the ball when time is ticking and the team desperately need points. Rules are also handled incorrectly. Roughing should result in an automatic first down, but in Backbreaker it's just a 15-yard penalty. Defensive pass interference is rarely called, even if you're shoving a receiver all over the field. None of these little problems destroy the experience on their own, but these issues add up to a number of aggravating moments.      The animations and hitting in Backbreaker are done so well that there is still fun to be had, but every other element is riddled with problems that make it hard to enjoy this game for the long term. It's a shame the nuts and bolts are so rough, because it really is amazing to see your players contort in painful ways. Because of this, Tackle Alley is the best way to enjoy this football game, stripping away many of the problems while letting you focus on what makes Backbreaker unique. But once the novelty of evading an entire team single-handedly wears off, you're left with a frustrating experience that has far too many issues to offer a worthwhile alternative to the Madden series.    "
4834,Emergency Heroes,2.0,0,"  Emergency Heroes is Ubisoft's attempt at an open-world game for young gamers. But with an incredibly sterile city, repetitive missions, and an inconsequential plot, the game manages to make playing as a police officer, a firefighter, and a medic no fun whatsoever. The single-player game is a five-hour slog through dull missions, and the introduction of friends in multiplayer does little to alleviate the boredom. In the end, it's a game that's so generic and devoid of fun that it actively sucks the life out of you as you play it.           You play as Zach Harper, an emergency hero in the city of San Alto. At the beginning of the game, Zach is recovering from being forced out of the city's combined services after a training accident killed one of his colleagues. Predictably, though, he's called back into action when a gang, led by a mysterious figure, starts terrorising the city. You can probably guess the twist from that description alone, but the story is so inconsequential that any spoilers are unlikely to impact your enjoyment. Emergency Heroes features some of the most cliched plotting, one-dimensional characterisation, and laughable dialogue ever to feature in a video game.        The gameplay itself is based entirely around driving, with no on-foot sections at all. You control vehicles either by holding the Wii Remote on its side or by using one of the many Wii Wheel-style peripherals, such as the one bundled with Mario Kart. The control method is functional, but the vehicles suffer from poor turning circles, and it's a shame that there's no option to use a Nunchuk. Even worse, all 12 vehicles handle the same, and even the smallest police car can smash a civilian truck right off of the road. There's also no punishment for crashing into an endless amount of innocent vehicles, which makes the game incredibly easy to play.        The story progresses through 40 preset missions, or ""perils,"" as they're called in the game. However, there are only a few different mission types, such as putting out fires, saving civilians, or inflicting enough damage on an enemy car to knock it off of the road. This lack of variety quickly becomes tiresome, and the city itself doesn't present any of the opportunities usually associated with sandbox games. You might not earn a gold medal for every mission on your first try, but it's unlikely that you'll actually fail one.        Given that this is an open-world game, you can spend some time driving around and taking in the sights. The problem is that San Alto lacks the landmarks, pedestrians, and other points of interest that might make you want to do so. All you have to look at is highway after tunnel after roundabout, resulting in a city that's boring and sterile. Emergency Heroes is perhaps a more shocking dystopian vision of the future than has been created by any number of science-fiction writers in the past. There are also bugs and design issues in abundance. Your car bounces over other vehicles, the GPS often points you in completely the wrong direction, and characters' heads pop up in the middle of the screen and block your view of the road, for no other reason than to offer up another line of meaningless dialogue.          Although the game itself is merely dull and repetitive, the overall presentation is on a whole different level of bad. The futuristic comic-book style is reminiscent of Crackdown on the Xbox 360, but it doesn't have that game's style or level of detail. The buildings all look the same, there are only a few different vehicle types, and the character designs look cheaper and more generic than the lowest-budget children's cartoon series. The music maintains a relentlessly fast tempo, but it fails to add drama to the monotonous pace of the game. Furthermore, the voice work teeters on the so-bad-it's-good level of amateurism. If you thought the House of the Dead series was laughably bad when it came to acting in video games, then Emergency Heroes makes that series look like a Royal Shakespeare Company production of Hamlet in comparison.       Though multiplayer modes help extend the longevity of the five-hour single-player game, they use the same mission types and are unsurprisingly as repetitive with friends as they are alone. The game supports two players via split-screen mode, and has seven multiplayer game modes in total once you've unlocked them by playing through the single-player game. These games aren't improved in any way by having another person involved, and there's no way to share your best times or play with other people online.        Emergency Heroes is a bad game. It's lazy, boring, and repetitive, and won't even appeal to the younger market that it's aimed at. The missions are dull, the driving is pedestrian, and the city is restrictive. Although it's not fundamentally broken, Emergency Heroes is devoid of any artistic merit and should be avoided at all costs.     "
1369,The Walking Dead: Michonne - A Telltale Miniseries,8.0,2,"The fallout of the second episode is dealt with, for sure--and how to leverage that outcome in order to please Norma and the remnants of the shantytown Michonne helped ruin. Once it’s figured out, however, Michonne is left as the only true adult in a house of abandoned children. The time with them that follows can be played coldly, but the cruelty of Michonne keeping distance from those in need, given what she has and will envision, doesn't feel right. To take Michonne this far is to accept that the mother she was did not die with her daughters, and more than the machete at her back, this is what will keep her alive. And so much of the first half of the episode goes, with Michonne carefully preparing her unconventional family for the worst. Aching, mournful moments lie within: a mother’s last letter, having to explain to a child what happened to his father, the decision to spend precious time to conduct a burial. And yet, it is all to the benefit of Michonne herself, showing strength far beyond the ability to lop of zombie limbs.It’s because of this that when the zombies do show up, it’s almost incongruous. The people add depth, tension, and terror all on their own. The Walkers look increasingly boring in the face of the human drama that surrounds them. Sure, the action is kinetic and brutal, as always, and one particular death gets especially gross, but the relevancy of these moments in the face of Michonne's layered story is diminished. It’s a problem exacerbated by graphical hitches, with faces disappearing, and jitters during QTEs at points where precision is crucial--issues that weren't apparent in the first two episodes.This episode's strengths still lay in its human element. The climax--a prisoner exchange with Norma--would be an anxious affair by itself, with Michonne's actions potentially hinging on a massive bluff. The scene becomes more impactful when you realize Norma's concerns mirror Michonne's, albeit with Norma fighting for the sake of a far more awful person. Telltale pulls off a minor miracle here: keeping the villains just empathetic enough to second-guess every action, which raises the tension in this sequence even higher.The real action occurs later, as Michonne loses her grip on reality and flashbacks and hallucinations cloud her judgement at the worst possible time, forcing a funhouse mirror redux of the reality-shifting intro in Episode 1. It’s hair-raising in the moment, and an example of excellent direction and planning.With the miniseries now complete, the game’s biggest flaw is in its structure. At least a half hour shorter than the other two episodes, What We Deserve nails the story Telltale has been tiptoeing around since first minute, and it’s something that only begins to present itself towards the end of Episode 2 before taking off here.As a complete story, Walking Dead Michonne is, truly, a story about family, in a way few game narratives are. Familial loss and the forced adoption of new members isn’t new for Walking Dead, but in Michonne--barring choosing to be cold during a moment of sorrow--we have someone who finds power in parenthood, instead of living in constant fear of it. Her weakness is in having already failed at it. It’s in finding out whether the weight of that failure should be allowed to break her or not. Of course, that’s the question that drives anyone stricken by loss. It’s an easy question with hard answers, and this is a game that doesn’t flinch from either."
2449,Omerta: City of Gangsters,4.0,0,"          Groundhog Day, rebuilding the same joints and bribing the police after your illegal activities attract too much heat, you're going to have to get your hands dirty. Combat in Omerta: City of Gangsters is brimming with promise. You handpick a team of reprobates, each with his own perks, specialties, and predilection for either ranged or melee weapons, and send them into the XCOM-style arenas. Each goon has a number of movement points and action points you can spend each turn, and there's clearly marked cover to use, a transparent turn order to facilitate strategy, and a plethora of status effects to grasp and manipulate.        Incredibly, despite this potential (or perhaps because of it), Omerta's combat manages to disappoint on almost every level. For starters, the cover system makes very little sense. One side of an obstacle offers stat-altering cover, while the other doesn't. A pillar offers cover, whereas a whole wall does not. Melee combat causes more status effects, and often does more damage, than gunfire. Worst of all, whether you're roughing up the local small-time crooks, pulling a bank heist, or busting your associates out of the slammer, there's no real risk involved.      While your enemies die in a hail of bullets and a splatter of crimson, your own posse is immortal. Your teammates are only knocked unconscious and then revived at the end of combat with a minor, time-limited status effect. Unsurprisingly, where there's no risk, there's little sense of reward. This is further exacerbated by the fact that all of your characters level up at set points in the game, regardless of their individual performances in combat or whether they participated in combat at all. The most damning indictment of the combat is that it's more satisfying to auto-resolve combat than to engage, facing the enemy only when the flimsy story forces you to.      There are multiplayer and sandbox modes, but their limited scope makes them wholly disposable. While on the surface the sandbox mode appears to alleviate the problem of short levels, it fails to offer any real goals or competition for your efforts. This leaves you to amass a huge amount of money and then pay off the police that halfheartedly investigate your burgeoning criminal activities. Multiplayer is even sparser and does away with the management elements of the game entirely, leaving only the less-than-thrilling combat. With just four game modes (two co-op, two competitive) played over four maps, the level and character assets are interminably reused and recycled, and the limited number of goals quickly wears thin. On a positive note, the bouts move at a reasonable pace thanks to a well-pitched turn time for all players.        While many of Omerta: City of Gangsters' constituent parts are disappointing, there is some enjoyment to be had after you push through the sluggish first 10 hours of the game. Even then, the core principles remain frustratingly underdeveloped, but at least the later levels require the fulfillment of multipart goals. This has the effect of granting you more time to tend to your infrastructure and settle down into each level. Sadly, by that point in the game, its underlying disposable nature has drilled into you the futility of doing anything other than reaching the goal as quickly as possible and moving on to the next level.     In the opening voice-over of Omerta: City of Gangsters, your fresh-off-the-boat two-bit protagonist muses that ""success is never about hard work."" Unfortunately, Omerta feels like nothing but work, and dull, repetitive work at that. It's certainly not a success, but a soulless, bland, incoherent experience that frequently frustrates with its inability to capitalise on a handful of good ideas.     "
4215,Sonic the Hedgehog (2006),4.0,0,"  In what might be seen as a move to reset and reinvent the series, the latest game to feature Sonic the Hedgehog is merely called Sonic the Hedgehog. Sega's blue critter has been around since the 16-bit days, when his side-scrolling platformers were strong enough to take on Mario, the then-undisputed kingpin of the platforming genre. Sonic's fall from grace has been slow, starting with a promising first stab at 3D with Sonic Adventure, but it's all been downhill since those far-gone days, and games like this new Sonic the Hedgehog are the culprit. With plenty of bad glitches, poor controls, and totally lame gameplay on all fronts, this one's not going to restore any part of the Hedgehog's name to glory.        While Sonic's name is on the box, you'll actually spend most of your time playing as other characters. The game is broken up into three different stories: one starring Sonic, one starring Shadow, and one starring a new hedgehog called Silver. Each of the stories play differently because of the way each hedgehog controls. Sonic is meant to be the fast-moving one, and he mainly attacks via a homing jump attack that makes most basic fights as simple as timing presses of the A button to bounce from foe to foe. Silver has telekinesis powers that let him pick up large objects and use his mind to fling them at enemies. He's not as fast as Sonic, but he has the ability to float in the air for brief periods of time, letting him cross larger gaps. Shadow the Hedgehog gets his own version of the homing attack, but the big difference is that he can drive around in different armed vehicles. Further watering the game down is a heavy supporting cast, so even when you pick the Sonic episode, you'll still occasionally play as Tails and Knuckles. Other Sonic collaborators, like Amy, Blaze, Rouge, and E-123 Omega also put in guest appearances. While the character variety might initially seem like a good idea, most of them aren't too interesting. Tails moves almost painfully slowly, and his fake ring bombs aren't any fun to use, so when Sonic levels occasionally switch over to him, it's immediately boring. In addition to the single-player levels, you can play the game in a two-player, split-screen tag mode that attempts to force players to cooperate as you progress through the story. In addition, you can go back and play levels you've completed in a battle mode.     While you play as many different characters throughout the main game, the same structure applies across the board. The game's action stages are separated by town portions, where you'll be able to take on dopey side missions to help out the locals or figure out puzzles to proceed. Each of these side missions are bookended by two sets of loading screens, where it first loads up the exact same scene, just with different text dialogue, then it loads up the actual mission. After that, it has to load up some ending text and then load up the out-of-mission version of that part of town. Each load time is fairly long, and when they stack up in this way, it almost makes the game feel broken.     But since the frequent and lengthy load times don't quite do it, it's up to the action stages to make the game actually feel broken. The camera is the most immediate problem, as it doesn't bother to give you a good view of the action on its own, and your control over it is inverted, with no option to change it. In some cases, the game changes angles at the worst possible time and the controls don't automatically compensate for the new angle. In one Sonic level, you're snowboarding down a mountain and must stay pointed in the right direction. When the camera flips around to give you a new view of the action, you immediately grind to a halt, because you're no longer pushing in the proper direction. This makes some sequences of the game a frustrating exercise in trial and error while you attempt to compensate for this mess. This is but one of several cases where the camera causes often-severe gameplay problems, and it gets frustrating to the point of being nearly unplayable. Since none of the hedgehogs can swim and there's plenty of water and endless, life-ending cliffs nearby, jumping or trying to do a homing attack when you're near a ledge is often scary, since you're rarely able to get a good look at the world around you. Death can also be a bit scary, because you have a limited number of lives and you're kicked all the way out to the main menu when you run out. The game doesn't save automatically, and you can't save in the middle of a mission, so special care must be taken to save immediately before you enter a new area, just to make sure you aren't later forced to repeat lengthy sections of the game.        Graphically, Sonic the Hedgehog is a glitchy mess that usually looks extremely bland. The town that Sonic spends most of his time saving looks like someone dug up some old Dreamcast-era artwork, brushed it up a little bit, and released it onto current consoles. While his animation for running and jumping usually looks OK, there are plenty of awkward moments, too, like spots in the level that cause the camera to freak out or the way Sonic occasionally launches from platform to platform with his head pointed directly at the ground. There are some better-looking levels in the game, though, and Silver's first level at least starts off with a bang, complete with a nice-looking devastated future city and a big fiery boss fight. Unfortunately, the very next level drops the psychic hedgehog into a nondescript forest setting that doesn't look any better than Sonic's ugly town, and it goes on from there. The characters are voiced in cutscenes with plenty of bad anime enthusiasm, but it's neither good enough to work on its own or bad enough to be funny. The rest of the game's dialogue is delivered through text. The music varies from fast-moving action themes to random ska-influenced tunes. It's passable, but aside from the main screen's title theme, none of it really stands out at all.     Only the most blindly reverent Sonic the Hedgehog fan could possibly squeeze any enjoyment out of Sega's latest adventure. This platformer is a mess from top to bottom, and any of the occasional moments that don't feel somehow broken only serve to make the game's other flaws appear that much bigger.  "
4621,F24: Stealth Fighter,4.0,0,"  F24 Stealth Fighter was clearly inspired by such classic air combat games as F-15 Strike Eagle and Turn and Burn: No Fly Zone. In the game, you climb into the cockpit of the fictional F24 fighter jet and fly missions from a first-person viewpoint in the skies over Iran. Unfortunately, the main thing F24 Stealth Fighter has in common with the air combat games of days gone by is that it looks and sounds like it was developed decades ago. Along with that, the dogfighting in the game is boring and is further stymied by the touchy controls and the disorienting visuals.        From the controls to what happens in the sky, F24 Stealth Fighter takes a laid-back approach to air combat. The D pad is used to steer the aircraft, while the buttons control throttle and weapons. You'll remain in the air just as long as you don't intentionally smash into the ground, run out of fuel, or get shot down. Your flight view is presented from a first-person perspective, but instead of employing 3D graphics, the game juxtaposes scaling cloud and aircraft sprites on top of 2D backdrops to fake a 3D look. All of the missions in the game follow the same format. Your first task is to get rid of any enemy MiGs patrolling the skies over the target area. Once you've taken out the planes, your next task is to fly to the designated waypoints and attack the enemy's ground targets, which can involve launching Tomahawk missiles at them or attacking them directly during a strafing run. There's really nothing to dogfighting or destroying ground targets. If an enemy MiG or surface-to-air missile gets behind you, all you need to do is turn around or drop some chaff to deal with the threat. Otherwise, shooting down a target simply involves sighting it and pressing the missile button when you hear the lock-on tone. To take out tanks, carriers, and structures on land, you'll occasionally have to use your guns to hit flashing target markers. Your own aircraft can absorb five hits before exploding, but you can return to the carrier's waypoint once per mission to automatically land for repairs and reloading. The developers clearly made a conscious effort to make blowing stuff up simple and easy.     Destroying the same enemy planes and tanks in the same repetitive fashion does get old pretty fast, but what really sucks the fun out of the game are the jumpy steering controls and disorienting visuals. When you tap the D pad, the targeting reticle goes flying. This makes it difficult to keep targets in view and makes it impossible to use the F24's machine guns in normal dogfight situations. Missiles lock on automatically and can turn on a dime to follow targets, so there's no compelling reason to ever use the guns, except when they're required for a strafing run. Disorientation is another common problem because the flat 2D backdrops don't provide anything in the way of terrain details or landmarks. All you ever see are generic clouds flying past. To locate targets and see which way you're going, you'll find yourself switching to the radar view (and interrupting the flow of combat) every few seconds.     The overall presentation is bland and lacks punch. The cockpit instrument panel occupies half of the screen in the Game Boy Advance version and one-third of the upper screen in the DS version. Enemy planes and vehicles are tiny unless you're right on top of them, and when you are on top of them, they turn into giant pixelated blobs. The sky and ground are merely two contrasting shades of color. If not for the plane's tendency to right itself and the fact that clouds are in the sky, you'd have no way of knowing which end is up. The only noteworthy graphical touches are the goofy cutscenes that show takeoffs and landings, as well as the missile-cam video clips that play on a small display in the cockpit when you destroy an enemy target. Also, there's not much to say about the audio. All of the requisite gun and missile sounds are present, while a guitar riff that's eerily similar to Kenny Loggins' music from Top Gun loops constantly. On the whole, F24 Stealth Fighter looks and feels similar to the air combat games that were produced for the Sega Genesis and SNES in the early 1990s. Now that it's 2007, both the GBA and Nintendo DS are capable of better.        For the most part, the GBA and DS versions of the game are identical. In both games, the main draw is the campaign mode, which spans 20 missions and takes approximately three hours to finish. The DS version includes a few minor enhancements that don't do anything to improve the overall experience. Some of the cockpit instrumentation was moved to the lower screen, and you can use the touch screen to perform a number of commands. However, you'll rarely find yourself doing so because it's easier and faster to press a button when you want to switch weapons or adjust speed. There's also a multiplayer mode in the DS version that lets as many as four players compete in deathmatch scenarios, but it suffers from the same problems as the main campaign mode, and every player must have his or her own cartridge to participate. Ultimately, the only worthwhile enhancement that the developers made to the DS version was replacing the GBA's password-based save system with an on-cartridge save function.     Even if you're totally desperate to acquire an air combat game for your GBA or DS, you're better off staying away from F24 Stealth Fighter. It's boring, it's ugly, and it's somewhat broken.    "
2618,Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown,8.0,2,"Street Fighter IV has had many positive effects on the genre. It has brought new players into the fighting game fold, and the increased audience allows for classic series that may have fallen by the wayside to be revived and put in the hands of new players eager to see the diverse breadth of experiences the genre has to offer. The original iterations of Virtua Fighter 5 released in 2007 struggled to make an impact: the original PlayStation 3 release lacked any sort of online play, while the Xbox 360 version debuted amid numerous other high-profile releases. Despite positive reviews, the original VF5 didn't make many waves.        Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown takes a different approach. Rather than being a full-priced disc release, it's a 1,200 MSP downloadable game available through Xbox Live Arcade. Instead of emphasizing the single-player quest modes of the original release, the game is geared toward competitive play, with a robust online matchmaking engine and in-depth training and tutorial modes. You don't earn items to customize your characters in-game; you buy downloadable customization packs that contain hundreds upon hundreds of items, costumes, and colors for each fighter. To top it all off, the game engine has received a significant overhaul, making the game more accessible to new players while adding depth and gameplay tweaks that longtime VF fans will find refreshing. The result is a package that, while somewhat lacking in certain respects, represents a tremendous value.     At first glance, Virtua Fighter is deceptively simple: there are only three buttons (guard, punch, and kick), no super meters or other gauges, and rings of varied size and shape to fight on. Once you begin playing, however, the game's depth gradually opens up. The three buttons, used in tandem with certain joystick movements, open up hundreds of different commands for each character, with each individual skill having numerous unique properties and potential uses. Every character has a wealth of different strikes, holds, throws, and counters of varying heights, speeds, and damage properties. The skills are based (sometimes rather loosely) on true-to-life martial arts, so don't expect the flashiness of massive fireballs, energy swords, or divekicks from across the length of the screen.      The more-grounded basis of Virtua Fighter doesn't make the game any less exciting, however: matches are fast-paced, tense, and involve more up-close-and-personal beatdowns. The smoothness and detail of the individual character animations accentuate the thrill of combat; the sheer satisfaction of landing a particularly complex and damaging combo or a rarely seen, off-the-wall throw is immense. Characters also come with unique properties that affect the way they play: tiny luchador El Blaze can dash speedily around the ring, drunken master Shun Di gains improved moves when he's plastered (yes, really), and gargantuan sumo Taka-Arashi's massive size renders him harder to knock down and hit with combo strings, to give a few examples.        There's a lot to each character in Virtua Fighter, and thus the learning curve is a bit steep. Thankfully, Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown offers robust training and tutorial modes to help both new players who are learning VF for the first time and longtime fans who might need to adjust to the gameplay changes from the original VF5. The tutorials start from the very basics of attacking, dodging, and guarding, and continue all the way to the new throw-escape system and advanced movement techniques.      Training mode, meanwhile, offers numerous ways to analyze and practice your newly learned skills, including numerous detailed input displays (complete with frame data for advanced players) and notations on how and where moves strike you or your opponent. The training dummy can also be set to react in a plethora of ways, including switching up command strings at random so you can practice anticipating and countering troublesome mix-ups. Replays of offline and online matches can also be saved, shared online, and carefully analyzed with similar tools to the training mode.      You certainly want to learn as much as you can, since Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown offers a considerable challenge both online and offline. The game lacks a single-player story or quest mode, instead offering more-personal improvement-driven content. Arcade mode is just that: a simple trip through a gauntlet of computer-controlled opponents with a credits roll at the end (as is typical for VF, there are no story scenes or character endings). Score Attack rewards you with points for clearing the stages as quickly, efficiently, and flashily as possible and includes online leaderboard rankings. License Challenge is similar to the random quest objectives that were given out during fights in Virtua Fighter 4: Evolution; you need to not only beat an opponent but fulfill certain other objectives in the meantime (such as landing a certain number of hits or using defensive techniques).         Finally, Special Sparring is available to players who have purchased the downloadable content bundles and features fights against characters decked out in some wild, weird, and just plain awesome special gear. All of the computer-controlled characters in the single-player modes start off easy but become surprisingly smart and realistic-behaving as you progress. While the challenge is welcome, the lack of a story mode or a mode to earn accolades and items like the quest modes in Virtua Fighter 4 Evolution or the original Virtua Fighter 5 is disappointing.     What Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown lacks in a single-player experience, however, it makes up for in versus play. Offline versus play affords you the usual settings of the genre, but it's the online matching that really shines. High-level Virtua Fighter play is dependent on extremely fast movements, and even the slightest bit of lag can throw off a person's ability to fight well.  To this end, players' connections are synced up before a match starts and in between rounds, which keeps lag to a minimum. While the lengthy delay before starting a match online can be annoying, when you're playing a buttery-smooth match against someone on the other side of the country, it's worth it.     Casual match online lobbies allow for up to eight players each and operate in a format similar to that of traditional arcades: winners keep playing until someone takes them down or they step off for a while, while others can wait to challenge them and spectate in the meantime. If you're serious about leveling up and proving your worth to the greater world of Virtua Fighter, you can climb the ranks in ranked matches against opponents from around the world.      While online works well, it isn't always perfect: distance and connection quality still play a huge factor in determining how well online play runs against another person. Most matches are very good, but you still run into a few bouts where the lag has a noticeable effect on gameplay. Very rarely does the game sputter and slow down completely. In our tests, Xbox Live play felt ever-so-slightly smoother than PSN play did, with higher-rated connections cropping up more often.        There's a huge amount of depth to VF5FS on its own, but you also have the option to purchase packs of DLC containing hundreds of items and colors to customize each character with. The customization itself isn't quite as in depth as something like Soul Calibur V's Create-a-Soul mode (which allowed you to alter things like body type and object placement), but the sheer amount of stuff you get in each 400 MSP character pack (or 1,200 MSP for one of two different multi-character packs) offers a great value when compared to other games of this type that charge $2 to $3 for static costumes.      Unfortunately, the DLC is the only way to gain access to these items--they can't be earned in-game. Also, in order to see other players' costumes in versus mode or online, you need to own the customization packs for their characters. Customization data isn't portable, either, meaning that when you go to a gaming meet or to your friend's place, you're going to have to whip up that awesome robot-suited Jeffry with a giant afro and a tiki mask you made at home from scratch again.     But even if you don't get the DLC, VF5FS offers some of the finest, most balanced, and most in-depth fighting on the market for a price that's hard to argue with. Each character is worthwhile, and you can spend weeks perfecting the use of a single fighter--only to go online and be greeted by another skilled player who uses your chosen character in a new and unexpected fashion. If what you want most from a fighting game is a deep, technical, and incredibly rewarding competitive experience, you can't go wrong with Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown.   "
1095,Splatoon 2,8.0,2,"Splatoon 2 is easy to love. It's colorful and quirky and unafraid to be different, and it's consistently a blast to play. As far as shooters go, its unique movement mechanics stand out and make each match exciting. And while the logistics of its multiplayer aren't perfect, Splatoon 2 is a vibrant and exuberant sequel with enough fresh additions and changes to set it apart from the original.Like the first game, Splatoon 2 stars human-squid hybrids called Inklings. Their world is bright and filled with nautical puns both spoken and implied, and even just walking around and picking out new clothes is delightful. The shoe store is called Shella Fresh, for example, and cute fish-themed decor peppers the hub area. That extends to the gameplay, of course; your weapons shoot (or sometimes fling) ink, and you can instantly change into your squid form and swim through ink puddles to reload. Swimming also has a stealth element to it, since you're harder to see and faster, and therefore better equipped for surprise attacks. You can also ink walls and swim up them in squid form, which adds to your verticality in matches. In the standard multiplayer mode Turf War, you're tasked with inking more of the map than your opponents while also ""splatting"" them to limit their progress.Multiplayer is undoubtedly the main draw of Splatoon 2, but both new and returning players should absolutely try the new-and-improved single player mode before jumping into any matches. Unlike in the first game, where you could only use the standard Splattershot gun in the campaign, Splatoon 2's serves as a fantastic introduction to all the basic weapon types you'll have access to--and it's much more robust, with collectibles that require a sharp eye to find and creative platforming challenges that really showcase how unique Splatoon 2's movement is for the shooter genre. And while it starts out a bit basic, each level builds on the last and requires clever application of your knowledge to complete. Grinding on rails while shooting targets, then switching to your squid form and successfully landing a tricky jump is satisfying not just because it's fun and cool but because it really feels like you've mastered Splatoon 2's new mechanics.Unfortunately, not all of the single player campaign's lessons make it into the multiplayer. Most notably, rail grinding, which is the standout from single player, isn't possible on Moray Towers' rails. That in particular feels like a missed opportunity, especially since that map is returning from the first game. However, getting to use a wide variety of weapons in single player makes the transition to multiplayer easier, and subtle tweaks to weapons and gear, like faster movement with the roller, add a layer of new strategy for veteran players. On top of that, the majority of the maps are new, and favorites include Inkblot Art Academy and The Reef, both of which have several vertical levels that result in intense struggles for control of the higher ground.The only multiplayer mode for non-ranked matches is Turf War, which is consistently so much fun that only having one casual mode isn't really a problem. Covering the most ground with your ink is a simple enough concept, but skillful movement, well-timed inking, and the right strategy for your weapon all work together to give each match more depth. There are some wrinkles with the logistics of these regular battles: there's no way to change your weapon once you're in a lobby, so you're stuck with whatever team composition you get, and you can't guarantee you'll be on the same team as any friends who join your lobby. But, as the most laid-back of the multiplayer options, Turf Wars' quick games and random team assignments make it easy to jump in and out and have fun without too much pressure. It might be frustrating when your team of randoms doesn't seem to know what they're doing, but the fast-paced struggle to cover turf with your team's ink is as exhilarating as ever.Ranked battles return with Tower Control, Rainmaker, and Splat Zones. Each mode is similar to game types you might be familiar with in other team shooters; Tower Control consists of escorting a tower to a goal, Rainmaker is like reverse capture the flag, and Splat Zones requires you to ""control"" specific areas for a certain amount of time by covering them with your team's ink. Unfortunately, the lobbies for ranked matches haven't been populated enough for us to play them ahead of launch, but based on our experience with the first game, we can expect these modes to work essentially the same way. Splatoon's ink mechanics make these modes feel different from other games, and the focus on specific objectives is great for competitive players who want something more than the informal structure of Turf War.There's also a new co-op mode called Salmon Run that lets you play alongside one to three friends in a horde environment. It's surprisingly challenging and requires more strategy and finesse than Turf War by far. Even on lower difficulties, my groups struggled against minibosses that require specific strategies to take out--they're less threatening than the single-player bosses but hard to deal with in high volumes. Successfully clearing the waves was satisfying knowing that we had to have worked well as a team in order to survive. In addition to the updated single-player campaign, this is another mode that shows off what's so great about Splatoon 2's unique gameplay in ways that PvP multiplayer doesn't.The biggest problems with the original Splatoon's multiplayer were limited matchmaking and a lack of voice chat, which made team strategy extremely cumbersome and difficult. While regular battles still lack shooter matchmaking mainstays like parties, there's a new mode called League Battle that lets you group up with either one or three other friends and play together in a more competitive environment. League battles include the same modes as ranked but don't affect your solo rank, which is a great option if your skills aren't quite in line with your friends'. That said, voice chat is still a problem--you have to use a phone app to communicate, which is inelegant at best and ridiculous for a modern team-based game. There's no good reason it couldn't have been included in-game.At first glance, Splatoon 2 seems very similar to the first game. But all the small changes, and even the bigger ones in single player and League Battles, make for a fresh take on the already unique shooter. If you played a lot of the original, the sequel has enough to keep you coming back, and if you're new to the game, it's a fantastic place to jump in."
1626,Attack on Titan: Humanity in Chains,4.0,0," Much of the best anime is set in worlds you wish you could visit, such as the early 1980s interpretation of metropolitan Japan in Urusei Yatsura, or the sprawling vision of Earth in Dragon Ball. As good as the original material is, its setting is an utterly miserable world. One hundred years of peace have just been shattered by the return of remorseless giants who only want to eat humans. What are you to do but try to defend yourself, especially if you're a revenge-hungry teen who watched helplessly as your mom became a snack? The titans' perpetually maniacal faces only add insult to one's presumable fate to become a decapitated morsel. For once, we have an anime in which teenage whining, scolding, and anxiety-driven introspection is justified, even if all this motivational talk, pointless or otherwise, comprises one-third of the anime's content. Humanity in Chains spares you these moments of angst while framing story missions with many of the show's most memorable scenes. If this game is partly designed to attract Attack on Titan virgins to watch the show, these brief videos are its most effective selling tools. The game is punctuated by the two opening themes and credits. If anything convinces you that you're about to experience the playable version of a well-received anime, it is the rehashing of a catchy and memorable title sequence. I haven't watched Attack on Titan since it appeared on Netflix over a year ago, so reacquainting myself with the resoundingly Germanic choral chanting was exciting, if only for a few minutes. The only thing missing is a Netflix streaming voucher to watch the show on the 3DS. Attack on Titan inadvertently poses a question that could have been asked decades ago: What if Spider-Man had a penchant for bladed melee weapons and his arms were freed from web-slinging? Add the mutant-hunting sentinels and you essentially have the gameplay premise for Humanity in Chains. Much like Spider-Man, you don't question how your gear manages to find an attachment point every time; you just run with it because there are more pressing matters, like a city filled with invading titans. You spend most of your time swinging from point to point because moving on foot is impractical and, more importantly, is the easiest way to get yourself killed. The point of all this maneuverability is to position yourself to attack the titans' napes, their main weak spot. Thanks to a lock-on function, this is a peculiarly simple task, provided you make an effort to avoid approaching titans from the front. Once you've initiated the attack, the only challenge lies in lining up a timing ring within a larger ring; pulling that off results in a hit. This challenge, unfortunately, makes up the bulk of your goals in Humanity in Chains, so it's normal to feel bored after about an hour of play. Aside from an optional spin attack and the ability to hinder a titan's mobility, there's no depth or nuance to combat. You're either aiming to deal a lethal blow to the titan or you're making a brief retreat in order to regroup. We've come to expect third-person adventures chocked full of objectives in a given sortie, which can take anywhere from 15 to 90 minutes to complete. There are missions in Humanity in Chains that take 30 seconds to clear. And when you're not killing titans, your tasks are more menial jobs, like performing CPR on fallen comrades or collecting food. The art department didn't even design the food; you just have to find gleaming blue dots on the ground. Not wanting to stick solely to the anime's script, developer Spike Chunsoft added world mode, a feature that lets you grow and customize your own squad of titan killers and team up in multiplayer. It's a well-intentioned mode that is meant to add replay value and an RPG-inspired sense of character ownership by starting you off with baseline stats. The world mode menu screen overlooks a base with multiple facilities, giving you the impression that there are a lot of activities there with which to eat up an afternoon. It is true that you can upgrade squadmates' abilities and craft weapons in world mode, but incentives to apply these enhancements in the field are sorely lacking. Not only are you stuck with the same types of titan takedown missions found in story mode, but now you're greatly underpowered. The chances of getting grabbed by a titan are much greater, as is the unlikelihood of freeing yourself from its grasp. Learning the ropes and learning from defeat would be engaging if not for that fact that world mode doesn't unlock until you've beaten seven story missions. By then, you've been spoiled by controlling top-tier titan-killer talent, ruining any motivation to start over again as an entry-level grunt. It's a case of foreplay deferred after a game has already spoiled its best moves. Attack on Titan: Humanity in Chains is further proof that the seemingly obvious genre for an anime-to-game adaptation isn't always the best one. Take the Ghost In The Shell games as another example. As enjoyable as it was to play as Motoko Kusanagi in third-person adventure Stand Alone Complex, it was an even better experience playing as the Tachikoma spider-tank in the original PlayStation game. The disappointment of poor mission variety in Humanity in Chains is compounded by the brevity of each assignment. And while world mode had the potential to show the franchise's appeal beyond the main story, its team customization allure is severely hobbled by the same shallow combat in story mode. Between the can't-look-away morbidity of being eaten and watching the ensemble cast persevere, there's no denying the draw of Attack on Titan and the potential for a superb game adaptation. Humanity in Chains just isn't that game. Given the squads of soldiers, the seemingly limitless influx of titans, and one's mobility options, there is surely hope for an excellent game set in this universe in the far-flung future."
3985,Double Dragon,5.0,1," Billy and Jimmy Lee's struggle against Machine Gun Willy and his gang of thugs began back in 1987, when the game Double Dragon was released in arcades. The arcade game featured a surfeit of fighting moves and great weapons, and has since gone on to spawn a number of home releases, few of which came close to capturing the things that made the original game so great. Now, one of the greatest games of all time is available for mobile phones. Like the NES version before it, though, Bandai's mobile version of Double Dragon doesn't do the original justice. This game may share the classic's title and some of its superficial trimmings, but it's been badly marred by slowdown and monotonous gameplay.      As the ""protectors of South Town,"" the Brothers Lee put the fear into assorted riffraff and street scum by way of their advanced martial arts skills. One particularly pernicious thug, Machine Gun Willy, has made off with Billy's fiancée Marion, prompting the Dragons to both declare war on his gang and invade his turf. Your job is to guide Billy (though there's no good way to implement a two-player mode on mobile, the game doesn't pit you against your brother at the end, as some other versions do) through four levels of punk-trashing action until you reach Willy's inner sanctum, where you'll attempt to put the scoundrel down for the count.   There's a ton of bad guys to be dealt with between South Town and Willy's hideout, so it's a good thing that your Lee brother has access to several punishing fighting techniques. You can pummel criminals using kick or punch combinations, you can knock enemies to the ground using elbow punches, you can polish opposition foreheads with your kneecap by using a hair-pull kick maneuver, you can toss adversaries over your shoulder, and you can even launch a devastating, special spin kick on enemies on all sides (at the cost of a health point). In addition, your brawler can pick up and use several different weapons, such as bats, shovels, bombs, and even an odd television-like appliance. Although you can run from side to side, jump attacks are conspicuously missing.   It's certainly nice to have these myriad fighting options, but their impacts are profoundly diminished by Double Dragon's slow-paced gameplay. The game runs at a snail's pace on the LG VX6000, with incredibly jerky animation that often makes the game feel almost turn-based. For example, you can't simply hold down a directional key to move. A single press of the direction key in question will move you two spaces using two frames of animation. Furthermore, you have to keep pressing keys to move around the screen and to activate your attacks, which are frustratingly slow-paced in their executions.   This slowdown, in combination with very dull enemy artificial intelligence, turns Double Dragon's all-important combat experience into a joyless slog. The intention of beat-'em-up games is to make you feel like you're skillfully defending yourself against impossible odds. Instead, Double Dragon's adversaries seem lethargic and uninterested in attacking you intelligently. They will generally approach you two at a time, angling to walk right up to you to punch you in the face--unless there are weapons on the ground. In this case, they'll make automatic beelines for them. If you simply time your kicks to catch your enemies as they enter your combat range, you can defeat them without much trouble. The only real challenge comes when enemies approach you from both directions, which means that you may have to use a superkick to knock them down to get them in front of you. If Double Dragon weren't unresponsive enough to occasionally prevent you from placing your attacks correctly, you could fly through the game by standing in one place and jamming on the attack keys as enemies walked right into your flurries of blows, even on the hardest difficulty level. Although there are four or five different types of enemies, they are all functionally similar, really differing only in their special attacks. Some baddies will give you a nasty backflip kick, while Abobo-like bruisers will hit you with a high-energy ground-pound. However, it's all essentially the same stuff.   Double Dragon looks OK, aside from its moribund rate of animation. The characters and background art are derived from the original version of the game, and though everything's pretty small, the graphics look good. Spit will fly from the mouths of enemies who have been punched in the face, and they will also double over when kicked in the stomach. Double Dragon's sound does the job of getting the action across, but the game could have used a few additional, varied effects--such as groans from expiring gutter trash--like in the classic version of the game. The title theme is spot-on, thankfully.      Overall, the mobile version of Double Dragon ranks as a disappointment. This iteration of Double Dragon is missing all of the interesting gameplay features that made the original so cool. There are no ladders or terrain to use to your advantage, the screen doesn't scroll, and, ultimately, there are no real reasons to trudge through dozens of identical enemies to reach the game's final confrontation. All told, you're better off leaving this version alone. "
3890,Tennis,5.0,1,"  Released in late 1985, Tennis was one of the first sports games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Though it may not seem very impressive now, Tennis was a substantial improvement over the Pong clones that had been passed off as tennis games up to that point. But unlike Ice Hockey, the game hasn't aged all that well. While it can be fun to play a few rounds here and there for nostalgic purposes, it's difficult to recommend when you consider the Wii already comes with a tennis game.        Tennis lets you play a singles match against the CPU, but the only way to play with another person is to team up and challenge the computer in doubles. There's no two-player singles play. There are five difficulty settings: Level 1 is slow and relatively easy, while level 5 is superfast and very tough. The sweet spot for most people will likely be level 3. At this level, the game moves at a brisk pace, and you don't always have to hit a perfect shot to win because the CPU will sometimes make mistakes. A match consists of three sets, and you need to win two sets to win the match. Each game is scored just as it is in real tennis, so if you tie at 40, you'll play out a deuce.      The controls in Tennis are about as simple as they come. Your player tosses the ball into the air to serve automatically, and you hit the 2 button to serve. Hitting 2 also performs a forehand or backhand, depending on which way you are facing. Lobs are done by pressing 1. They can be pretty handy against the computer on the lower difficulty levels but not so much on the harder settings. Rather than aiming your shots by pressing the D pad, your aim is based on timing. If you hit the ball early on a forehand, it'll go crosscourt to the left; hit it right on time, it will go straight; swing late, it'll go crosscourt to the right. Unless you're hitting the ball from a severe angle, it will rarely go out of bounds. Outside of the occasional bad serve, the ball will seldom hit the net either. It's also pretty difficult to hit clean winning shots that blow past your opponent. This means that you'll need to rely on CPU mistakes to win points. As a result, matches can drag on for a very long time. Sure, you can use the Virtual Console's ability to save your game state should the matches run too long, but it would have been nice to simply have the option to set match length to allow for shorter games.     The presentation in Tennis is about what you'd expect for an NES sports game circa 1985. The players are large and detailed (for their time). The court is nothing more than a basic tennis court, and the crowd doesn't move, flash, or cheer after a point. However, the one cool touch is that the person umpiring the match is none other than Mario. There's very little audio in the game. You hear the familiar little ditty that played at the start of many early NES games, which is about it for the music. Sound effects are on par with an Atari 2600 game, which is disappointing.     Many people may have memories of playing some intense games of Tennis in the '80s and may be tempted to purchase the game for a trip down memory lane. These people will probably be slightly let down. The action on the court is enjoyable for a short while, but the omission of a two-player versus mode means that there's probably not enough depth to keep you entertained for very long.   "
2041,Rambo: The Video Game,6.0,1,"First Blood in the '80s has given us the term ""going Rambo"" anytime someone decides to take on insurmountable challenges in a video game. And for the first time in many years, we have a video game that lets you inhabit the role of John Rambo. should be, and enjoy it for what it is. ""I'm here to talk to you about a man who killed dozens. John Rambo. And it's good that he's dead."" These are the words you hear at the funeral that launches the game. From there, you play a flashback mission as the war hero John Rambo in Vietnam, guns ablazin' as you attempt to escape being a prisoner of war. Here you discover the game's cover system, which allows you to take cover in three different directions at any given time, leaving you exposed to some foes while shielded from others depending on the direction you take. It's a step up from the arcade limitation that typically leaves you with ""in cover"" or ""shooting"" as your only options. The mission also introduces you to the wrath bar, and Wrath mode, which enables you to regain your health and get back to going Rambo by killing as many enemies as possible before the bar depletes. After war, regular life just isn't the same. Rambo is thrown into jail by the sheriff of Hope, Washington. But it's not prison that makes his life hell. It's quick-time events. As the bully deputies attempt to shave Rambo with a straight razor, he rebels and escapes through a series of nothing but properly timed button presses. The quick-time events in the game offer more points if you press them with proper timing, but mostly act as a boring and clichéd way to add interactivity to cinematic events. Throughout the remainder of the first chapter of story missions, you're encouraged to avoid killing your foes, because simply disarming them gives bonus points. After all, those are American citizens you're shooting at, soldier! By the end of the chapter, you find yourself sympathizing with poor mass-murdering John Rambo, because he really didn't mean to hurt anyone. Well, apart from those Vietcong. After taking down the sheriff standing in your way of a normal life, you finally earn the peace and quiet you wanted all along. Back in prison, again! The story does follow the movie series' plotlines, with major stages and events hewing as close as possible to the source material while still under the guise of a video game. (Forgetting, of course, that Mr. Rambo was not the killing machine pop culture has made him out to be.) Of course, since Stallone wasn't available to do voice acting for the game, Teyon decided to instead use sound bites directly from the movies. This causes the volume levels of different cinematics to vary wildly. Coupled with the game's atrocious graphics, Rambo is a painful experience for the eyes and ears, with only the limited but excellent soundtrack rising above the ugliness. The somber brass of the main menu and funeral scene, the melodic strings that tie the plot together, and the upbeat tracks that fuel the explosive carnage of combat are perfectly at home and enjoyable to listen to in their own right.  In addition to the contextual directional cover system, there are well-placed explosive barrels, good incentives for proper aim over spraying and praying, and enough challenge in (some of) the missions to keep this generally easy game from being a complete cakewalk. Luckily, there's also a higher difficulty setting, and a one- to three-star-based scoring system that encourages you to always do better than the time before. And if that weren't enough, the game offers specific objectives to shoot for in the hopes of earning a brand-new shiny gun to wield as a secondary weapon. If you're having trouble perfecting your approach to missions or challenges, then it's time to delve into the game's skill and perk system. The game offers perks varying from being unable to fail QTE events (wait, really?) to gaining health back from headshots or disarming opponents, to bonuses to your Wrath mode. With up to three perk slots able to be unlocked, you can customize John Rambo to your own tastes or the task at hand. The skill system gives you the ability to upgrade your damage resistance, light weapons, heavy weapons, miscellaneous weapons, or your Wrath mode, but I didn't find any reason to invest in anything but damage resistance or Wrath mode in lower levels. The perks system reeks of poor balance and the charade of choice. Enemies die in two or three properly-aimed shots, so skills granting bonus damage aren't necessary, and it only takes a few turns of the reload wheel to get the hang of reloading, thus diminishing the usefulness of light- and heavy-weapon expertise. Rambo: The Video Game does a solid job of breaking potential monotony with various alternate battle methods. Although some of these involve moving from quick-time event to quick-time event, you're also given a helping of helicopter missions and an opportunity to use enemies' own tanks against them. While these segments don't last long, they also are neither overused nor overdone, and offer a breather from the game's gauntlet of gun battles. The game's initial playthrough doesn't take more than a few hours, but becoming a master of the game can take a bit more investment. You don't have to be a fan of the Rambo franchise to enjoy Rambo: The Video Game, but it helps to have at least spent a bit of time in an arcade as a light-gun-slinger. And this time around, you don't have to stock your pockets full of quarters to prepare to blast your way through screen after screen of Vietcong, Afghan, and Soviet enemies."
737,Anthem,6.0,1,"Launching upward off a jungle floor and bursting through a thick canopy of trees, bobbing and weaving your way under a waterfall as you take in the lush landscape below you, is one of the highlights of Anthem. Flight, in these moments, is freeing, serene and exhilarating all at once. But you will eventually have to come back down to earth. When you don't have a means to cool down in the air, you have to interrupt your flight to cool off on the ground--or else your suit will overheat and send you careening downward much more violently. This is what Anthem is like as a whole: a game where promising moments are bookended by frustration, where good ideas are undone before they can be fully realized.It can take a while to warm up to Anthem in the first place. In its intro mission, you are a rookie Freelancer--a hero type who battles threats to humanity in mechanized combat suits called javelins. But that brief mission ends in failure, and after a two-year time skip, you're now an experienced Freelancer. As a result, everyone talks to you as if you know everything about the world, even though much of the game's space-fantasy jargon is explained only in codex entries. ""Shapers,"" ""Arcanists,"" to ""silence"" this or that ""relic""--all the dialogue is structured as if you already know what all these things are, so there's not even an element of mystery to it. It's just hard to follow.The story and overall worldbuilding do a great disservice to the characters, which have elements of what you might think of as BioWare's pedigree. The main cast is well-acted and genuine, with complicated emotions and motivations that might have been interesting had they been given time to grow. Two characters are mad at you for the events of the tutorial, even though it's never quite clear why; that bad blood spills over into your relationship with your current partner-in-Freelancing, Owen, and there's enough believable awkwardness there to make you almost feel bad for him. But because the narrative is so poorly set up, the drama feels unearned, the ""emotional"" reveals robbed of their impact, and any connection you might have had to the characters just out of reach.Exacerbating all of this is Anthem's loot game core, which is simple on paper. After every mission, you return to your base of operations, Fort Tarsis, to talk to people, get new missions, and tinker with your javelins using the loot you picked up from the previous mission. Missions themselves almost universally involve some quick narrative setup followed by flying, completing routine tasks, and plenty of combat (with more brief plot-related stuff thrown in via radio chatter).But this general structure doesn't work well in practice. You're told up front that playing Anthem with others is the best way to play and that you'll get better rewards in a group, but this means asking your friends to be quiet every few minutes so you can hear a bit of dialogue or to wait patiently while you tweak your loadout. Playing solo is better if you want to take your time and talk to different characters, but doing so can make missions more difficult or tedious. Matchmaking with random people is the best option, since you'll have people with you for grindy parts but will leave you alone for the story--but even then, it's easy to lose track of what's going on, especially if someone in your team is ahead of you and triggering dialogue early.And no matter what, you'll have to return to Fort Tarsis after each expedition, which makes for choppy pacing in both the story and the gameplay. There's no way to change your loadout on the go and no way to just continue on to another mission right away, and there are currently a number of loading screens in between leaving and returning to Fort Tarsis. It's hard to really get into any kind of flow.When I finally took the time to talk to NPCs in between missions, I found endearing characters and brief but interesting bits of story spread between them. There's one girl who just loves animals no matter how dangerous, and she'll happily tell you all about them; there's the oldest man in Fort Tarsis, who admits to doing some shady things to earn that title; there's an old woman whose daughter has been missing for years and might just need some kindness. Though it took some patience to do it, I was glad I stopped to listen to them.Throughout all of this, combat is the main thing keeping Anthem afloat. There are four types of javelins--Ranger, Storm, Interceptor, and Colossus--that are essentially a soldier, mage, assassin, and tank, respectively. Each plays differently, with a different pool of abilities, and you aren't locked into the one you start with; you unlock them as you level up. That, combined with a handful of new weapons and abilities after each mission, means that you're almost always experimenting with new loadouts and playstyles.I initially picked the Ranger, thinking it would be a good all-around class while I was learning the basics. But the guns alone aren't enough to make Anthem combat's exciting; I found a lot of the weapons, especially shotguns, to feel ineffectual. The Ranger's abilities are pretty straightforward, too--you get grenades and missiles and the like--which left me largely unimpressed with combat in the beginning. But then I unlocked the speedy Interceptor, whose gymnastic jumps and swift melee strikes are incredibly satisfying, and I started to get excited about trying new things in each successive mission.The Storm javelin became my favorite, though, because it both has interesting elemental abilities and can hover for minutes, not seconds, at a time before overheating. Its assortment of powers lends itself well to getting combos, which result in a satisfying explosion of sorts and a more chaotic battlefield. But more importantly, it's the only javelin that doesn't require frequent stops on the ground, and as a result it provides the most dynamic combat--you can go from shooting basic enemies in a hallway to floating above the battlefield, raining down lightning to wipe out five at once while scoping out the area for your team.The endgame thus far is to complete high numbers of the various mission types, which amounts to repeating many individual missions. The draw is better gear, but without compelling high-level fights, you don't have anything to build toward with all that grinding. A post-credits cutscene has the most intriguing plot point in the game and serves as a preview of what might come later on--but right now it's just a promise, rather than a true incentive to keep going.It's worth noting that the early access period saw a number of technical hiccups. Dropped audio, server issues, long loading times, missions not registering as complete--I didn't have a single session without some sort of problem. A day-one patch aims to iron much of this out, but overall, the poor structure and pacing are a more frustrating problem. [Editor's note: We have now tried Anthem on PS4 Pro, Xbox One, and Xbox One X. The Pro and X versions generally run decently, with some technical hiccups and occasional frame rate drops, while we encountered more stuttering and strain on the standard Xbox One.]Anthem has good ideas, but it struggles significantly with the execution. It's a co-op game that works best with no one talking; it buries genuinely interesting character moments and puts its most incomprehensible story bits at the forefront; its combat is exciting until you get to the boss fights and find your wings have been clipped. Even the simple, exhilarating act of flying is frequently interrupted by the limitations of your javelin, and you never quite shake that feeling of disappointment--of knowing, throughout the good parts of Anthem, that you'll inevitably come crashing back down."
831,Pro Evolution Soccer 2019,9.0,2,"The improvements to PES's superlative brand of football initially appear trivial, like Konami simply slapped a new lick of paint on last year's game. It still adopts the same methodical pace, tangible sense of weight, and breadth of passing as PES 2018, but after a couple of matches you begin to notice subtle changes that gradually add up. The impact of another year's worth of development becomes palpable.Passing is, of course, the bedrock of any great football game, and PES 2019 enhances its passing dynamism with a plethora of new animations, bringing each kick of the ball to life with startling accuracy. Players are intelligent enough to contextually know what pass to play and when, giving you a greater sense of control over each passing move. If you're receiving the ball under pressure from a burly centre-half, you'll have the confidence to know you can potentially flick the ball around the corner to an overlapping winger or deftly play it back to a midfielder so he can knock it into space with the outside of his boot.There's an impressive variety of passes in any one match, while the fluidity of the players' movement and the responsiveness behind each button press lead to moments of scintillating football--whether you're patiently building from the back, carving a team open with a clinical counter-attack, or hoofing it up to your big target man. PES's passing mechanics have been so accomplished for so many years now that there's always been a singular pleasure in simply shifting the ball between teammates. That outstanding feeling has only intensified in PES 2019.Ball physics have been reworked and greatly contribute to this, too, making that little white sphere feel considerably more like a separate entity than ever before. It never appears as if the ball is rigidly stuck to your player's feet, nor are your passes laser-guided to their target. There's an authentic flow and unpredictability to the way the ball moves, curling and dipping through the air, spinning off a goalkeeper's fingertips, and neatly coming under the delicate control of a player like Mesut Özil. No one would blame you if you hopped into a replay just to ogle the ball's flight path and the animation that preceded it. Sending a diagonal pass to the opposite wing just feels right, and this excellence emanates out to each aspect of PES 2019's on-pitch action.Players are more reactive off the ball and make smarter runs, pointing to the space they're about to sprint into to let you know when to unleash that inch-perfect through ball. There's more physicality to matches in PES 2019, too. Hurtling into a tackle and fighting tooth-and-nail to win the ball back with a defender is much more active and satisfying as a result. Players will jostle for position, realistically clattering into each other, and it feels rewarding to barge an attacker off the ball, or hold off a defender with a diminutive winger, before using a feint to create some space and escape their clutches.Executing feints, step-overs, and other skill moves is intuitive, with each one mapped to the left and right sticks. There are few better feelings in PES than leaving a defender for dead with an eye-opening piece of skill, and this feeds into an added emphasis on player individuality. Cut inside with Lionel Messi and he's liable to flick the ball over the outstretched leg of a defender, using his low centre of gravity to peel past them, before rasping a left-footed shot into the bottom corner of the net. Meanwhile, someone like Paul Pogba will saunter around the midfield, finding pockets of space and using his large frame to maintain possession, while Roberto Firmino will occasionally bust out a no-look pass, and Cristiano Ronaldo will hang in the air on crosses for what feels like eternity, or smash in a dipping 30-yard screamer that has the 'keeper rueing his luck. PES has a recent history of making both its players and its teams feel unique, and with a deluge of superb new animations, PES 2019 is no different.It's not all roses, however, as it does still share some of the more disappointing aspects of its predecessors. Referees, for example, are maddeningly inconsistent; both too lenient and too harsh in the same match, while match presentation is bland and lifeless. A new naturalistic lighting engine produces some stunning sights, casting realistic shadows across much improved grass and crowd textures. But the UI surrounding it still feels trapped in the past, and stalwart commentators Peter Drury and Jim Beglin return with the same disjointed dialogue we've come to know and hate, with little in the way of new lines. Drury will still get overly excited by tame shots, and there's only so many times you can listen to Beglin say ""If you don't speculate, you won't accumulate"" across multiple games before you're tempted to turn the commentary off completely.Some of the teams that are officially partnered with PES get the red carpet treatment, with recognisable chants and an authentic atmosphere permeating every home match. Play with Liverpool at Anfield and the kop will belt out ""You'll never walk alone"" before the match begins. On the flip side of this, teams with no official ties to PES receive canned crowd noises and indecipherable chants that rob these games of any ambience. This isn't terrible, but after showing a more accurate depiction of a Saturday afternoon matchday, the lack of a distinct atmosphere in these games can't help but feel like a downgrade.Disappointingly, Master League remains almost untouched. The International Champions Cup debuts as a short pre-season tournament, and transfer negotiations have been slightly reworked, giving you more flexibility when it comes to player fees and contracts. You can now include clauses like clean-sheet bonuses and sell-on fees so there's not just a lump sum involved, but AI transfer logic still isn't particularly smart. Budgets and fees don't replicate the reality of the transfer market, with much smaller numbers than the astronomical prices we've seen players going for in recent years. It's possible to buy a player like Aymeric Laporte for £12 million a mere six months after Manchester City splashed out £57 million for the central defender in the real world.At least goalkeepers have finally seen some enhancements. They're essentially useless when rushing off the goal line, regularly failing to close down an attacking player's angles, but this is where the faults end. Each number one's ability as a shot stopper has seen a marked improvement. Just like elsewhere on the pitch, goalkeepers have been blessed with a range of new animations that banish their previously robotic nature. They'll pull off some eye-catching saves, getting fingertips to shots destined for the top corner, or just generally making themselves as big as possible in order to get something, anything, on an incoming shot.You'll need your 'keeper to be on top form in the latter stages of a match, too. The stamina system in PES 2019 has been reworked to place significantly more importance on your players' fitness. This has been dubbed ""visible fatigue,"" and it does exactly what it says. Run a team ragged and their midfield and defence will visibly tire as the match wears on, potentially opening up space for you to exploit with fresh legs off the bench. This isn't a one-way street, though, as you'll need to be mindful of your own players' stamina as well--your star midfielder isn't much use if he can barely muster a light jog. This forces you to play a more considered game of football, sprinting only when it's absolutely necessary and making timely substitutions when the situation calls for it. This is a literal game-changing feature, and it wonderfully complements PES's brand of authentic, methodical football.It's a shame, then, that PES is still trailing FIFA when it comes to official licensing. Losing the Champions League and Europa League licenses to the EA behemoth is a massive blow for PES. To Konami's credit, it has responded by obtaining more licensed leagues than ever before, with the likes of the Scottish Premiership, the Russian Premier Liga, and Superliga Argentina all being featured in their official forms. They're certainly welcome additions, but these aren't standout leagues that are going to move the needle the same way the English Premier League or La Liga would. If you want to play in the Madrid derby you're still stuck choosing between KB Red White and MD White, and the Bundesliga is completely absent beyond Schalke 04 and Bayer Leverkusen, meaning two of Europe's biggest clubs--Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich--are nowhere to be found. Thankfully, the PES community does an amazing job creating update files if you want to mod in the teams, players, and kits that are missing, but you're out of luck on Xbox One where this isn't possible.PES 2019's online servers are surprisingly stable, considering the series' history of troubled connections. We didn't encounter any noticeable latency across dozens and dozens of online matches. Meanwhile, myClub introduces a few changes to its Ultimate Team-esque formula. Featured Players are now released each week, with outstanding performances in the real world translating to attribute boosts in PES. The way you attain new players has changed, too, with players bundled in packs of four as opposed to the single player you would get in previous iterations of the mode. This lets you build up your squad faster or turn these additional players into XP trainers that can boost some of the key players in your team. If you receive three duplicates of the same player, you can also combine them together to get a higher-rated version of that player. Ultimately, these tweaks don't alter the structure of myClub too much, but it's a fun mode to engage with purely to play more of its outstanding brand of football.For as long as EA continues to develop FIFA and hold a monopoly over official licences, PES will be the scrappy underdog just hoping for a surprise upset, even when it's fielding the likes of London Blue and PV White Red. The lack of licences for top-tier leagues remains a disheartening sticking point, but PES continues to make brilliant strides on the pitch, building on what was already an incredibly satisfying game of football to produce one of the greatest playing football games of all time. It might be lacking off the pitch, but put it on the field against the competition and a famous giant killing wouldn't be all that surprising."
3751,Star Wars: The Force Unleashed - Ultimate Sith Edition,5.0,1,"  The first sign that Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is a mediocre port comes as soon as you boot up the game: you can’t navigate the menus with a mouse. On its own, this isn't an awful fact, but it's an omen of bad things to come. Aside from resolution and brightness options, there are no visual options to tweak. There is no antialiasing and no way to enable it. And frame rate troubles will haunt your every saber swing. It's too bad that so little respect was shown for the platform--and to those that will spend money on this product--because the underlying game is rather good. As Darth Vader's secret apprentice, you slice through grunting Rodians with your glowing lightsaber, go head-to-head with slobbering rancors, and punt jawas into the distance as if they were pigskins. You might be lucky enough to avoid this troubled port's technical flaws and experience the full pleasures of The Force Unleashed, but be warned: Picking up a copy of this physics-heavy action game is one gamble that may not pay off.         The Force Unleashed's main campaign is the same as the one that appeared on consoles in 2008. For more details, check our  full review of that version, as all of the ups and downs of the original release still hold true. When the action comes together, it's hard to stifle your excitement. As Galen Marek, aka Starkiller, you execute your foes by carving them up with your lightsaber, using your Force push ability to propel them down corridors and zap them with jolts of Force lightning. The best moments come by way of the Force grip power, which you use to lift objects and foes and fling them around, leaving a trail of death, destruction, and Wookiee corpses in your wake. Unfortunately, the difficulties of the earlier console version are along for the ride, too, such as the imprecise targeting that makes it too difficult to pick up the object you intended. Thankfully, the keyboard and mouse controls don't usually add more to the frustration, and they do a good enough of job of letting you chain your powers together during most battles. The fixed-camera boss battles, which are more comfortably played with a controller, are an exception. As a result, you'll probably want to stick with a gamepad for the most consistently rewarding experience.      Sadly, technical problems may hinder your chances for enjoyment. On two out of three test systems--all of which exceeded the game's recommended hardware requirements--we encountered performance issues that heavily interfered with the experience. The frame rate was wildly inconsistent, taking huge dips whenever there was a lot of action onscreen, and on one system, frame rate troubles were accompanied by snaps and crackles in the audio. Should you run into visual issues, there is no way to adjust graphics settings to improve the game's performance. The Force Unleashed allows you to only adjust the display resolution and brightness levels, so forget tweaking your lighting and anisotropic filter settings. Even if you can run the game without trouble, you'll lament that the widescreen cinematics are stretched on a monitor with a 4:3 aspect ratio. It's a shame that these issues will overshadow some absolutely excellent art design for so many players. Environments like the robot graveyards on Raxus Prime look fantastic, and swirled, stylized textures add fantasy flair to the overall look. The visuals won't blow you away when compared to other PC games, but they have plenty of dramatic appeal.         This edition of The Force Unleashed includes three stand-alone missions, two of which were released as downloadable content for the original console version. The Jedi Temple mission is excellent, pitting you against large groups of foes that will have you on the move and exploiting every Force power to its fullest. It drops you right into the action from the outset and maintains a high level of excitement, particularly during a thrilling battle against a crowd of droids. A few puzzle sequences help break up the tempo to keep the mission fresh, and lots of destructible objects make the action seem especially explosive. The visuals are lovely--in keeping with the best levels from the main campaign--and some ethereal music plucked from the Star Wars library makes one sequence feel, appropriately enough, otherworldly. The second of these missions takes place on Tatooine and features familiar characters, as well as more great art design. There are also a couple of fun boss fights and an intriguing alternate-history story. For more information, check out our review of the Tatooine Mission Pack.      The final additional mission was not available as console DLC and is exclusive to the Ultimate Sith Edition. Compared to the other stand-alone journeys, this mission on Hoth is a disappointment--though not from a story perspective, thanks to a fascinating ending that will give Star Wars fans an opportunity to munch on all sorts of non-canon fodder. The gameplay is less compelling and involves moving from one ice cave to the next, chopping and zapping rebel soldiers and wampas. The action is broken up only by a couple of boss battles and a few light puzzle elements. The mission is fun, but its predictable pace and bland level design hinders it from reaching the heights of the other two added missions.         It's a wonder that Star Wars: The Force Unleashed: Ultimate Sith Edition for the PC was released at all considering the insignificant effort that seems to have been put into it. Even in the realm of sloppy ports, this one seems particularly egregious, considering its almost total lack of visual options and performance troubles. It's unfortunate that this version feels so rushed because in spite of the core game's scattered flaws, it's an ultimately enjoyable adventure that tells a great story populated by memorable characters. Alas, if you're a PC enthusiast who is tired of rushed console ports, The Force Unleashed is another game to add to that ever-growing list.   "
4406,G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,4.0,0,"  The 1980's animated series G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero famously featured a series of good-natured public service announcements. These PSAs taught youngsters safety lessons, like not to play with electrical wires and to be careful with campfires. They did not, however, tell you not to play G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, so if you need an official warning, let this be it: Don't do it! Even in the realm of licensed tie-ins, this monotonous third-person action game is particularly poor, managing not only to screw up the mechanics it rips off from other games, but also failing to get even the basics right. An awful camera, atrocious vehicle sequences, and dreadful storytelling are just a few of the inhumanities you'll face on this mission to spoil the latest scheme from the terrorist group Cobra. Local co-op play eases the tedium and frustrations, but even the closest of friends can't rescue you from this snake's venomous fangs. So now you know--and knowing is half the battle.          G.I. Joe borrows liberally from Contra and Gears of War. You and another Joe (controlled either by another player or the AI) run through a series of 3D environments, blasting everything in sight to earn points and occasionally taking cover and popping out to fire at the more resilient nasties. Bringing enemies down consists mostly of holding down a trigger to shoot and hitting a button to tumble or hide behind conspicuously placed barriers. There should have been fun here. With more than a dozen different characters to unlock and play, G.I. Joe could have delivered action enthusiasts some fast-paced gunplay, or amused franchise fans with a fun and entertaining story. Instead, you get ugly cutscenes, bad dialogue, and deadpan voice acting that expresses all the excitement of a long yawn. And the gameplay itself is not only sloppy and boring, but it fails to get a number of essentials right.      G.I. Joe's fixed camera is the first example of a simple ingredient gone sour. You get absolutely no camera control. As you traverse the environments, approach downward slopes, and turn corners, the camera will swoop around to give you what is apparently intended to be a proper view of the proceedings. But it leads to disaster. You'll be shot at from offscreen enemies, or have to run toward the camera, unable to see where you are going. When the camera view suddenly flips while you are moving, the controls often won't adjust properly, so your Joe may go running off in some direction other than the one you intended. Plenty of games with fixed or semifixed cameras (think Devil May Cry) have managed these camera shifts properly; there's no excuse for the issues here. Things become even more disastrous when you jump into any of the game's slippery vehicles. You always push the stick forward to move the vehicle forward, but your view of the action may be from the side, from slightly above, or even from in front. And the camera will move about as you drive, forcing you to constantly rethink which direction you need to push the stick in to make the tank move in the direction you want it to go.         Another standard component done poorly: the targeting system. The Rise of Cobra selects a target for you automatically. You can switch targets using the right stick, but if you take cover and select any enemy other than the default target, the game will automatically switch your target back to the default if you don't fire for a few seconds. Why? Who knows. The fact that you can fire at certain power-ups to reap their benefits only complicates matters. The game doesn't distinguish among foes that can hurt you, buildings that cannot, and these score-enhancing cubes. Thus, you'll be surrounded by Cobra grunts but firing at some offscreen power-up because the game can't prioritize a dude with a gun over a harmless cube hovering in the air. When an enemy does fall, the targeting may not lock on to nearby foes because they are behind you--which happens often, given the rotten camera. If you play on the middle or upper difficulty level, you may die once or twice, almost always because of the awful camera or the awful targeting.       The bits stolen from--er, inspired by--Gears of War don't fare much better because they don't feel right in this context. For example, a single button sticks you behind cover, but it also makes you tumble. Given that the action is generally quick and the camera view is constantly changing, the one-button-does-all approach might cause you to take cover when you want to roll and roll when you want to take cover. Or you'll take cover on the opposite side of an obstacle, thereby turning your back to the enemy and proving that cover systems like this only work when the player is always viewing his or her character from behind. These oddities make battles feel loose and messy, though the game still manages to scatter in a few moments of fun anyway. When you get room to move about and don't need to worry about cover all that much, the simple action isn't notable, but it's decent in small doses. The action kicks up a notch for boss fights, but the rampant invisible walls and predictable mechanics knock it back down a few pegs.     In addition to a basic melee attack and a basic ranged attack, each character can perform a special attack or skill, and some of these are amusing to unleash. Unfortunately, some of these abilities are also imbalanced. Ripcord's turret-laying ability, for example, will make mincemeat of standard enemies and minibosses. And speaking of imbalances, if you are playing with AI teammates, you'll want to take Gung-Ho along. The friendly AI is invincible but does very little damage, no matter whom you take along. However, Gung-Ho's missiles will knock enemies down, which is a lot more helpful than an AI-controlled Joe that just soaks up damage. Things pick up a bit when you replace the AI with another player. Your AI teammate doesn't really take cover in competent ways or try to avoid fire, but it doesn't matter because he can't die anyway. At least with another player, you can coordinate attacks and try to steal power-ups from each other in hopes of getting the higher score. You'll want to stick close together, though, because the camera may get hung up if you veer too far apart.         The most enjoyable moments Rise of the Cobra offers are those that involve the accelerator suit. Every so often, you can temporarily activate this parka of power, which makes you invincible and lets you move about with blazing speed and do lots of damage. More single-button double duty may cause you to activate the suit by accident (the same button opens doors and activates computer terminals). But assuming you mean to use the suit, you'll probably get a bit of glee from the results, if not from the great power you wield, then from the tacky, awesome music that you trigger. That vigorous short theme is the one aspect of the game that gets the G.I Joe vibe right; it's too bad that the rest of the sound design doesn't follow suit. The soundtrack is fine; the sound effects, however, range from mediocre to outright terrible. The tinny din of the weapons is enough to make you reach for something spongy to shove in your ears, and other sound effects don't sound right at all. For example, when you break open crates, the flying debris sounds more like the whirring of a computer in a bad 1960's sci-fi movie than ricocheting rubbish.      G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is full of things that make you go ""hmm."" Why do midlevel checkpoints update your score but not save your game, forcing you to restart from the beginning if both characters die? If you're going to steal from Gears of War, why steal the slow-walking, earpiece-cradling mission updates? The game isn't all bad; there are a few moments of fun to be had with the simple combat system. But G.I. Joe doesn't do much beyond the fundamentals, and sadly, it gets very few of them right.    "
3209,Knights Contract,6.0,1,"     you choose when she unleashes the good stuff. These magical attacks can entwine enemies in thorny vines or impale them with spikes. They can magnify your scythe to a bigger size or create a succession of shadow scythes so that one swing hits four times. Catching an enemy in these attacks makes you feel even more powerful because your skills are magically compounded. You eventually unlock more spells than you can fit in the four available slots, so you have to choose which ones you want equipped at what time. Not every enemy or boss is susceptible to the same magic, and finding the right spell can make combat easier and bloodier. As you earn souls from killing enemies, you can upgrade your spells to make them even nastier, so that single phantom sword can turn into a deadly parade of swords that chases your enemies around the arena.        Assaulting your foes with magical and martial attacks is gratifying, and executing gruesome finishers puts an exclamation point on the whole affair. When you hit a weakened enemy with a magical attack, a button prompt gives you a chance to finish with style. That toothy trap you laid suddenly becomes a chomping, devouring maw, and those swords impale your enemies and split them into bloody chunks. Finding the right finisher for the right situation can boost your combo rating, earning you more souls and pouring points into your witch point gauge. Once this gauge is full, you can choose who gets to unleash it. If you choose Heinrich, he turns into a hulking minotaur that can dish out a huge amount of damage in a short time. If you choose Gretchen, she immediately makes all (or almost all) of your foes vanish from the screen. Well, not quite immediately. First, your enemies are transported to a formless blue realm. Then, they are struck down by a giant blue naked Gretchen. Her action might be simple, like closing her fist on the enemies in the palm of her hand, or it might be more provocative, like crushing the enemies positioned on her knee by crossing her leg a la Basic Instinct. There's an array of poses that big blue Gretchen can strike, but almost all of them involve a degree of nudity that, while not quite explicit, certainly is immodest.         Despite her formidable magical talents, Gretchen is vulnerable to enemy attacks. You have to keep an eye on her health because if she dies, it's game over. You can summon her into your arms and run around while carrying her, a move that increases health regeneration for both characters. If you stray too far from her or she gets restrained by an enemy, you won't be able to use magic until you rectify the situation. Some enemies and environments represent more of a threat to Gretchen than others, but for the most part, keeping her alive is a manageable task despite her occasional AI miscues. Keeping Heinrich healthy is important too, but even if you are killed and your body parts splattered across the floor, a brief stint of button mashing will put him back together again. Gretchen is extra vulnerable during this time, however, so it's best to stay in one piece.        Combat in Knights Contract heightens to a fevered pitch during the impressive boss fights. The character designs for these fearsome foes are a visual highlight, from the sinewy three-legged creature with too many eyeballs and teeth to the towering purple ogre in steel bondage gear. Learning their patterns, dodging their attacks, and striking back at them can be very engaging, but keeping Gretchen alive can be seriously difficult. Bosses can kill her with just a few hits, so you often have to spend time running around carrying her instead of attacking. While this may be part of the challenge, some bosses take things too far, resulting in a lot of cheap deaths. The worst offender is a fiery warrior witch that creates pools of lava, and Gretchen can't seem to get herself out of them. You can't pick her up because then you will catch fire and she will jump out of your arms, usually back into the fire. This boss also dishes out some knockdown attacks that can send you flying out of the small arena to your death. In another boss fight, you can follow a prompt to jump up onto the boss's massive body, but this can often result in you inexplicably jumping to your doom. Similar environmental problems and overly perilous attacks sometimes appear in normal combat, but they are manageable irritations. In boss fights, they are infuriating obstacles.      When you finally manage to whittle down the boss's health far enough, you are confronted with an extremely unforgiving sequence of quick-time events. The window of time you have to respond to a given onscreen prompt is very, very small, and nothing but the fastest twitch reflexes will cut it. If you fail just one press, the boss regains some health and you have to resume normal combat. These sequences often contain five or more presses, each one equally strict. While you are tensely waiting for the next press, Heinrich and Gretchen are teaming up in cool ways to put the finishing blows on the boss, but you can hardly appreciate it because your eyes are fixed to the prompt location. The only consolation is that the presses follow the same sequence every time, so you can eventually memorize them and hit them the instant they appear. The boss fights in Knights Contract are some of the most climactic and exciting encounters in the game, but the incredibly difficult quick-time events add a lot of frustration and aggravation.       Your adventure proceeds at a good pace for the first half of the game, but then you enter levels that feel like detours and the game loses some momentum. There is still satisfying combat and nice environmental design touches to be found in these parts, however. Fleshy homunculi splatter pleasantly when you hit them with a finisher, and earlier levels are reskinned with a great fire-scorched look accentuated by gently floating ash. Still, a reskinned level isn't as exciting as a new level, and some of the new ones feel too mazelike for their own good. Some novel twists mix things up for a level or two, and this helps keep you interested. Yet Heinrich isn't exactly a speed demon, and his loping jog starts to feel like a plodding schlep when you have to backtrack frequently. Knights Contract can keep you busy for a good long while, but the uneven pace can also weaken your motivation to press forward.     With erratic pacing and often-aggravating boss fights, Knights Contract doesn't always feel like a worthwhile adventure. Yet though the flashy combat isn't very complex, it's fun to wield your deadly weapon and powerful magic spells in brutal tandem. The problematic gameplay elements can dampen this fun, but the stylish artistic design and interesting story help counterbalance these issues. Knights Contract isn't a game for those without the patience to push through some trying times, but those who persevere will find some savage satisfaction.   "
4698,Monster Truck Fury,3.0,0," Though there are exceptions, budget-priced games don't stack up well against full-priced games because of their generally lower quality in all aspects of their design. Unfortunately, Monster Truck Rumble only perpetuates this pattern with its uninspired single-player modes, poor course design and graphics, and terrible sound effects.   Monster Truck Rumble offers four single-player modes, including a free run, circuit race, wreck 'n' crush, and lance race. The free run mode doesn't include any objectives, so you're free to roam around any course to take a look at the monochromatic terrain, as well as the animals, which look and act as though they're made out of Styrofoam. In the circuit race mode, you'll choose from any four of the six courses available (the remaining two are lane race tracks only) and race through checkpoints scattered around the area. The wreck 'n' crush mode hides a series of small car piles around the circuit-style courses, and the truck that wrecks the most cars within the given time period wins the mode. Lastly, the lane race is a basic track race in an enclosed area filled with various obstacles and a few tight turns. Three of the four modes that involve competition actually use a helpful radar system, indicating the location of checkpoints, car piles, and opponents. There is also a damage meter that indicates the amount of damage your truck has sustained before it's completely wrecked. Monster Truck Rumble offers no championship-style mode that rewards you for a good race, so when a race ends, the main menu screen reappears. There's nothing particularly wrong with any of the available modes of play--it's the fact that other aspects of the game are so poor that it makes these other modes suffer.   Monster Truck Rumble's visuals are one of its weakest points. For somewhat obvious reasons, the developers based courses on areas such as the Mojave Desert and other similarly desolate locales, but regardless of the course name, they all pretty much look the same. Granted, one course may have a canyon area while another may have a small farmhouse or a set of train tracks that lead to nowhere, but they all use the same brown textures, the same Styrofoam objects, and the same general structure. They're so lifeless and unappealing that they make the game feel like a chore. It's also worth noting that what appear to be buffalo and chickens aren't really animals at all, as they flip and roll through the air like small rocks when they make contact with your truck. Also, special effects, such as rain that happens to be black and headlights that don't actually illuminate the surrounding area, provide further evidence of the general lack of effort put forth to create convincing environments. To top it all off, the fact that there's slowdown at higher resolutions is completely unforgivable considering the simplistic low-polygon 3D models used for the environments and trucks.   Along similar lines, Monster Truck Rumble's sound effects just don't make any sense. Whenever you collide with a chicken, a buffalo, or even tumbleweed, the game produces the same sound effect used when two trucks collide. Unless Monster Truck Rumble is trying to make some strange environmental message, it's obvious that sound effects weren't exactly the highest priority. As for music, there is one song that plays during the menu screen and nothing more, which is another missed opportunity to give the game some much-needed character.   Control is just about the only area of the game that isn't a complete disaster. For the most part, Monster Truck Rumble's controls are quite responsive, so you shouldn't have any problems navigating each track. There are moments when you can lose complete control of the car, particularly during spinouts or collisions with various objects, but that's to be expected. Also, slowdown tends to affect the control at times, but after a while, you'll learn to compensate for it.   In the end, all of the racing modes in Monster Truck Rumble, including its two-player split-screen mode, are ruined by the bland, poorly designed environments. Despite that it doesn't play terribly, Monster Truck Rumble really has nothing to offer--it's impossible to recommend despite its low price tag, as there are plenty of other similarly priced racing games that are much, much better.

138,A Plague Tale: Requiem,7.0,2,"There's a sequence in A Plague Tale: Requiem's fourth chapter where you're forced to flee a literal tsunami of rats. As you jump from one stone rooftop to another, the swarm of plague-infested vermin sweeps through the town below like raging flood waters, toppling over buildings at their foundations and consuming anyone caught in its destructive path. It's a moment of Hollywood spectacle that showcases the remarkable advancements in technology since A Plague Tale: Innocence was released in 2019. Whereas the first game could handle 5,000 rats at any one time, its sequel can populate the screen with a staggering 300,000. This vast multiplication enhances the terrifying and oppressive nature of the series' signature rodents, but moments like this are an outlier; for the most part, Requiem feels very familiar to its predecessor.Although developer Asobo Studio has supplemented its stealth action gameplay with a few new additions, this sense of familiarity persists throughout the first half of the game. Like Innocence, Requiem puts you in the well-worn shoes of Amicia de Rune, a teenage girl who's tasked with protecting her younger brother, Hugo, as they traverse a plague-stricken, 14th-century France in search of a cure for his mysterious illness. Amicia is armed with a sling that can both kill helmet-less enemies and strike crates of conveniently-placed armor to create a distraction. You also have access to alchemical ammo that can either light fires or snuff them out, letting you navigate through the mischief of light-averse rats and use them to your advantage by shrouding enemies in darkness.Amicia is a more proficient fighter this time around, so you're able to counter armored enemies after being spotted and leave them stunned for a few seconds. If you have a single-use knife handy, you can finish them off with a killing blow, but knives are hard to come by and also double as a tool for opening padlocked workbenches. These hidden stashes are filled with various crafting materials, so I always found it more advantageous to hold onto any knives I could get my hands on rather than wasting them on a single kill. You can also use Amicia's sling to strangle unarmored enemies by catching them unaware from behind. There's an element of risk and reward in doing so, however, since the animation is fairly lengthy and it's not completely quiet.As a result of Amicia's fragility, most encounters in Requiem demand a stealthy approach, such as sneaking through tall grass, crawling under carts, and throwing pots to divert prying eyes. When you're not utilizing rats to devour the soldiers in your way, this distraction-based stealth isn't the most interesting and hasn't really evolved since Innocence. It makes sense within the context of the game and sells the relentlessness of the situation Amicia and Hugo are in, as the odds are stacked against them, and their entire existence essentially boils down to escaping death over and over again. But the environments you're in are often fairly linear and cramped, so your avenues of approach are severely limited. Unlike the first game, you can at least re-enter stealth after being caught by running away, losing line-of-sight, and hiding, but these early areas don't offer enough space to make this feasible, so restarting the section is usually your best option upon detection.Fortunately, the game starts to stretch its legs around five hours in, and this also coincides with the introduction of a few more tools and abilities for you to play with. Amicia eventually gains access to a deadly crossbow that can kill most armored enemies with a single bolt. To offset the weapon’s power, ammunition is scarce, so it's not something you'll be using often, but Hugo has a more reliable way of dispatching any enemies in your path: rats. The disease he's afflicted with has gradually deepened his connection with the plague-carrying rodents, giving you the chance to directly control the writhing mass and violently consume those unprotected by light. There's something disturbingly satisfying about watching a mischief of rats wash over people until there's almost nothing left, although controlling them is limited by a gauge that fills with use, putting Hugo's powers out of action for a while once filled.Amecia and Hugo’s circumstances make it difficult for the pair to trust anyone, but they are often joined on their travels by a number of companions who help out in either stealth or combat. Arnaud, for instance, is a gruff soldier who can be directed to fight enemies with the press of a button. He reliably wins one-on-one duels within a few moves, but he's loud and you'll need to lend a helping hand if he gets surrounded, otherwise he'll die and trigger a game over. Sophia, on the other hand, is a pirate you meet in the latter half of the game. She comes equipped with a shard of glass that can be used to deflect sunlight and set dry grass on fire. This provides a valuable distraction since any soldiers nearby will leave their patrol route to stamp out the small flame.These new toys add renewed energy and a semblance of strategy to encounters, especially in areas where the game opens up and allows you to navigate past enemies in more ways than one. Aside from offering multiple paths through a section, these larger maps also encourage you to adopt a particular playstyle--which is further incentivized by Requiem's skill system. By opting for the pacifist route, for example, and sneaking past enemies without being spotted or killing anyone, you'll unlock skills geared toward improving your stealth abilities--such as increasing your speed when crouched and dampening the amount of noise you make when moving. If you're aggressive, on the other hand, you'll gain access to abilities including a push that lets you shove enemies into fire or rats, and another that speeds up the amount of time it takes to choke out foes with Amicia's sling. You can mix and match approaches to unlock skills in each category, so there's an element of freedom present in how you shape Amicia's repertoire. If you have your eye on a particular skill, though, it's easy to find yourself compelled to adopt a specific playstyle.There's also some light puzzle-solving sprinkled throughout that's never too complicated and usually revolves around using various light sources to traverse through rat-infested areas. These moments provide a welcome change of pace, although there are a few too many instances where you need to push carts in order to climb up and reach higher levels, which feels both contrived and archaic. Similarly, there are a number of moments where you're forced into confined combat scenarios where the only way through is by killing everyone in your path. The role these sequences play in Requiem's story is impactful, as it chronicles Amicia's shifting attitude since the first game, and tackles the struggles and guilt she faces with each life she's forced to snuff out. But from a gameplay perspective, they offer little more than frustrating trial and error. Combat isn't especially difficult, but the game likes to punish you in order to underline Amicia's fragility. It feels like there's a correct path through these sequences, and you'll die over and over again until you can figure out what it is.Missteps like this are disappointing, not least because there's so much to love about Requiem's story and setting. The narrative picks up six months after the first game ended, with Amicia and Hugo traveling to the region of Provence in southern France, bordering the Mediterranean Sea. It's the beginning of summer, so this new setting infuses the game with an abundance of color and vibrancy that wasn't present in the original. It's utterly beautiful at times, with sunkissed fields bursting with the color of lavender and daffodil flowers, bustling markets draped in black and yellow banners, and windswept cliffsides overlooking an incoming thunderstorm. War and the rat-carrying plague are yet to puncture this region of France, so the game takes every opportunity to capture these quiet moments where you're surrounded by the vivacity of life and nature.At its core, Requiem feels like a game of stark contrasts. The picturesque setting and mesmerizing sights it frequently conjures make the influx of sudden violence all the more impactful, while also adding another element of terror to the darkness of night. You'll enter a town where people are shopping at a florist's stall, or taking in a street performance with exorbitant glee, and witnessing this makes it hit harder when the rats swarm in and leave the bare corpses of those same people in their wake. You see it reflected in Hugo, too, where the innocence of his childhood glee clashes with his harrowing circumstances, whether it's because he's wrestling with his disease and connection with the rats, exploding in anger at the world's cruelty, or struggling to deal with the horrible things he's seen.Amicia and Hugo's characterization is at the heart of Requiem's story and propels the narrative forward even when it occasionally stumbles. There's a sequence around halfway through where the game's relentless pace slows to a crawl so it can dump a load of exposition. This could've been tightened up and shortened, particularly since the game's last couple of hours feel overly drawn out. These are my only nitpicks with the story, though. The performances across the board are excellent, and I appreciate its authentic portrayal of anxiety and panic attacks as the consequences of their traumatic experiences finally catch up with Amicia. It can seem cruel at times, but Requiem tells a heartrending and powerful tale that's worth seeing through to the end.This is where that familiarity creeps in again, as the exact same thing can be said of the first game. A Plague Tale: Requiem excels in the same areas its predecessor did. Its stealth-action gameplay is uneven but has at least improved, introducing more tools for you to play around with and expanding in scope to provide more interesting avenues to explore when it comes to traversing past threats both human and rodent alike. The rats are still its most memorable feature, bursting from the floor like geysers and in more numbers than ever before. There's a lot to love in Requiem, even if frustration is an all-too-common bedfellow when it comes to gameplay. There are better stealth games out there, but its unique setting, poignant storytelling, and rat-infested dread make 14th-century France worth returning to."
3986,ESPN NFL PrimeTime 2002,5.0,1,"ESPN NFL Prime Time for the Xbox is a football game that's best suited for people who are really into the management aspect of football, mostly because it features an incredible list of management options--but also because it's simply not the best-playing or best-looking Xbox football game out there.   ESPN NFL Prime Time features a full NFL license and has all of the actual teams, players, and stadiums. It also has the typical ESPN game presentation that tries to emulate a TV broadcast, complete with commentary by Chris Berman and Tom Jackson. The game comes with four standard modes of play-- exhibition, franchise, practice, and tournament. The franchise mode in Prime Time is really the game's only strong point. It has an incredible amount of depth and lets you totally control every aspect of the team from the draft and into the post season, with players both resigning and retiring. The game even features a create-a-play mode in which you can set routes and actions for just about every player on your squad. You can then go into the game's practice mode to perfect the play and then add it to your team's playbook. The game also gives you the ability to come up with an entire game plan so that you can create a winning strategy that uses your team's strengths. You can even set the amount of playtime that each player should have in the preseason, which will affect his abilities on the field during the season. Prime Time also features a scenario option in the exhibition mode, which lets you create specific scenarios for your team to practice. For instance, to see how your team performs, you can set up a scenario in which it's fourth down on the 1-yard line with only 10 seconds left in the game. Aside from this impressive list of unusual off-the-field options, Prime Time gives you the ability to create your own players, trade players, and accept CPU-initiated offers.    While ESPN NFL Prime Time certainly has an impressive franchise mode, the actual playing of the game leaves something to be desired, especially if you've already seen or played any of the other football games for the Xbox. The controls, while fairly responsive, are very basic in execution and feel. Making the right play selection seems to almost have more importance on the field than actually controlling your players-- especially since it's basically impossible to break a tackle once a defender touches the ball carrier. You do, however, have a great number of actions to execute--such as stiff-arms, hurdles, and jukes--to keep defenders from getting a hold of the ball carrier. And because the game's play selection screen is typical and intuitive, calling plays is very straightforward. The artificial intelligence of the CPU-controlled team and players are decent on the game's advanced difficulty setting--they manage the clock fairly well, call intelligent plays in general situations, but get a little crossed up when the clock and situation become very specific.   ESPN NFL Prime Time isn't the most impressive-looking Xbox football game on the market. The player models are fairly bulky, the animation is rather limited, and the textures are very plain. You can recognize players by their faces, and while some do look better than others, the game does a decent job of representing the players of the NFL. ESPN NFL Prime Time tries to re-create a TV broadcast look with the usual replays and commentary and succeeds to a lesser degree. Odd graphical quirks--like the fact that players seem to continuously breathe steam no matter the time of day or weather conditions--are evident. The front-end menu system, however, does look very sharp.    In the end, ESPN NFL Prime Time is a very simple football game, which makes it the least exciting NFL game on the Xbox. The game does feature one of the most robust franchise modes, which gives you the ability to become the general manager. These two facts combined make ESPN NFL Prime Time the perfect game for anyone who's big into fantasy football but just isn't very good with a controller. The flip side is that ESPN NFL Prime Time isn't the right game for anyone who's greatly concerned about the presentation and handling of his or her football game."
698,Darkwood,9.0,2,"When Darkwood originally launched in early access in 2014, it was an ambitious game that suffered from clunkiness and a lack of identity. In GameSpot's early access review, writer Brett Todd admired its willingness to experiment with aesthetics and rework the concept of permadeath, but couldn't get past the fact that it wasn't quite ready to go on sale. Now, in 2019, Darkwood is an entirely new game.It was inevitable that Darkwood would be compared to similar open-world survival games like the Burtonesque Don't Starve, and from a gameplay standpoint their top-down perspectives and day/night cycles are similar. However, the most recent iteration of this macabre indie game is unwaveringly confident in itself. Darkwood revels in its eponymous darkness--even its daytime cycles are subjected to limited visibility, courtesy of its field-of-vision illumination. The best thing about this is that it doesn't rely on nighttime to be scary. Even at the crack of dawn, venturing too far from your hideout can result in you coming face to face with blood-curdling, satanic sadists hellbent on mauling you to death.The game assimilates a plethora of systems into its makeup, including crafting, bartering, and combat. Although the mechanics are quite complex, Darkwood offers an intense but fair learning curve. While the controls are clearly mapped out on the pause menu, learning how to manipulate some of the game's ostensibly unimportant mechanics can give you a major edge as you progress into its more difficult areas. For example, the game affords you skills in exchange for cooking in ominous ovens. These skills usually only have a minor impact on the game, allowing you to benefit from a daily single-use perk such as running without taking stamina into account. However, these perks come at a cost: For every skill you gain, you must apply a negative effect designed to hinder you for the rest of your playthrough. These are incredibly minor, but in a game as brutally unforgiving as Darkwood, it's essential to level up with caution, which subverts the entire idea of leveling up rapidly in the first place.As a result, opting to favor survivability over gratifyingly quick forward momentum often allows you to live longer in the end--something that's absolutely essential on Darkwood's harder modes, where lives are limited. But even on Normal difficulty, it's important that you recognize that this is an ambiguous world that necessitates experimentation. As the world deteriorates into madness around you, the only way to survive is to adapt alongside decay. Rather than help you, Darkwood's systems affect you in a much more neutral way. I spent a night boarded up in a hideout that was fortified to the teeth with barriers only to be attacked by packs of demonic dogs moments before the saving grace of the sunrise. However, I also happened to survive three nights in a row by hiding inconspicuously in a cramped corner, praying that I wasn't overwhelmed by hordes of red chompers in the twilight.Because you're never truly safe in Darkwood, it's easy to lose track of time. Eventually, days seem to merge into one another, and it becomes startlingly clear that the majority of society has descended into an irreparable state of madness. People live in a perpetually frozen cycle of day and night in which there are only two recurring parts of the same day, repeated eternally. The characters you meet are mostly uninterested in speaking with you, but among the Silent Forest's more amicable residents are an aspiring astronaut named Piotrek, who is attempting to build a rocket ship out of hunks of scrap metal, and a muttering musician who plays dissonant, apocalyptic notes on a broken violin in an effort to win the hand of a woman kept locked in the basement by her older sister--something made all the more horrifying by how poorly he performs. These post-plague virtuosos are at home in Darkwood's chaos, and their chosen vocations reflect the fact that they've already been absorbed by the chaos of this dynamic and disintegrating world. That's one of the most horrifying things about Darkwood: the way in which humanity learns to use madness as an asset in a world without order.That's one of the most horrifying things about Darkwood: the way in which humanity learns to use madness as an asset in a world without order.There are, however, some aspects of Darkwood that indicate the transient nature of life in the forest. At the beginning of the game, you're given the opportunity to euthanize your wounded dog, who sits outside your house whimpering in pain. If you choose not to, the dog transforms into a vicious varmint by the time you return later, ferociously clawing and gnawing at you in a deranged state of mindless violence. Darkwood's narrative is ambiguous at the best of times and is mostly to do with choosing which NPCs to favor in various subplots, but easily-overlooked details like this dog's fate tell disturbing tales of their own. As a result, some subplots only tell part of the story. Other details are intricately interwoven into the environment, and these narrative manifestations and the more ostensible plot points are of equal importance in understanding the world at large.That's what makes Darkwood so brilliantly-suited to console. Although on the surface a keyboard suits the game's mechanics--namely its hotfixed inventory system and the quickfire solutions that are often necessary for survival in the night--there's something much more visceral about playing with analog sticks and haptic feedback. Instead of simply pressing a combination of keys to attack anathemic abominations, you need to use hyper-sensitive camera control to succeed in combat. Dodging is mapped to an analog click, whereas shooting a gun genuinely feels instinctive because enemies close distance at an alarming rate. It's easy to miss point-blank because of a knee-jerk reaction, and it's the fact that you can be punished once and for all for doing so that makes the game all the more hair-raising.What makes Darkwood truly special, though, is its world. At one point in the game, you visit an area simply known as ""The Village."" Here, a group of deranged denizens worship a gnarled sow, deifying it as ""The Mother of all Pigs."" Almost everyone in the village has descended into a state of utter insanity, with one of the town’s most domineering residents having developed a gravitation toward chickens after locking up her own sister to save her marrying a chagrined musician. Most of the citizens here immediately associate you with an aura of antipathy, but the fact they live in such an aloof society is horrifying. All around, the world is darkening and fading, and this singular town, serving as a bastion against a descent into savagery, is inevitably lost. Because you, the safe and sound player, get to witness it from an external perspective, The Village's encroaching demise is drastically more affecting. This is the last of the world, and it's due to go out not with a bang, but a whimper.While Darkwood is an absolute marvel in terms of its aesthetics and gameplay--as well as its disarmingly dissonant score--I experienced several bugs that caused me to lose minor progress. In one case, I was trapped behind a disassembled tractor, which forced me to quit to the main menu and restart the game in order to press onward. On top of this, one of the game's areas caused the frame rate to drop so dramatically that playing became a chore. This was easily rectified, again simply requiring a soft reboot, but these glitches are a disappointing nuisance plaguing an otherwise exceptional game. However, these bugs aren't game-breaking. And even though they irritated me, I couldn’t pull myself away from Darkwood, no matter how much its uncanny world made me audibly squeal. Rather than relying on jump scares--although they are present, to a minor degree--Darkwood psychologically unhinges you. You’re consistently lured into a false sense of security as you hole up in an ironclad hideaway before night falls, or when seemingly benevolent NPCs beguile you with promises of collaboration against the hordes of darkness. It’s horror by subversion, because it’s only when you’re safest that you let your guard down--and it’s only when you take that singular breath of respite that you concede to utter susceptibility. There’s nothing quite as scary as momentarily looking away before being drawn back in by a sound cue or a controller vibration. And before you know it, it’s fight or flight, as you fall into the fray of the unforgiving darkness and are forced to compose yourself within a split second or risk losing half your inventory.In Darkwood, there’s an item you can show several NPCs called ""photo of a road."" What’s interesting about this is that several of these entirely disparate wanderers have the exact same response to this curious snapshot. ""Around here,"" they say, ""all roads lead to nowhere."" And as Darkwood’s forest is guzzled up by the rapidly encroaching night, roads are no longer places-between-places. Instead, they’re a communal necropolis, waiting for the creatures of the night to tribute more destitute dupes to its earthy, deathly soil."
3244,DC Universe Online,7.0,2,"   City of Heroes, City of Villains, and Champions Online. If you've played one of them, you might be disappointed that at least initially, DC Universe Online doesn't offer the cosmetic flexibility for which those other superhero-themed games are so well known. That isn't to say that the character creation isn't robust, though you might have your imagination somewhat stifled. Of course, DC Universe Online instantly stands out by having heroes and villains alike share the same world. Once you tailor your creation to your liking, you select a weapon (if you want to play with other weapons, don't despair; your options expand later); choose a basic power set (gadgets, ice, fire, and so on); and choose one of three available mentors, such as Lex Luthor if you're a villain, or Wonder Woman, if you're a hero.      Fortunately, if you are disappointed by the initial creation options, you aren't stuck with this vision of your hero or villain forever. You earn and buy new gear as you play, but equipping a new cape doesn't mean you have to change your physical appearance. You can equip that cape for its improved stats without removing your demonic wings if they're more consistent with your overall look. In your main headquarters (the Hall of Doom for villains; the Justice League of America Watchtower for heroes), you can purchase additional cosmetic items, and when you hit on a look you really like, you can lock the entire costume--or just individual aspects of it.        After character creation, you are treated to DC Universe Online's fine tutorial, which does a great job of explaining why the world is burgeoning with superpowered individuals and demonstrating just how different the game's combat is from other online role-playing games. This is an action game in online role-playing form. When you press a button on your controller or mouse, you swing your blade, shoot your bow, or fire your rifle. There is the slightest amount of latency between your actions and the ones onscreen, but it's not enough to diminish the immediacy of battle. In most MMOGs, your key press doesn't necessarily translate to immediate contact between your weapon and your foe. DCUO's directness makes it fun for almost anyone from the get-go and a refreshing change of pace from typical entries in the genre. Superpowers are limited by your power bar (RPG vets might think of this as their mana pool.) Weapon skills, on the other hand, can be strung together with abandon, whether that means whipping your staff around like an overly enthusiastic drum major or leaping backward while you fire your dual pistols as if you're auditioning for a John Woo film.      Fluid combat animations, sparkling visual effects, and the combat's general responsiveness keep DCUO fun for quite a while, though it loses some of its luster over time. As you level up, you spend points on new combos, which not only make you more effective in combat, but also make battles more visually appealing. Nevertheless, the button presses/mouse clicks required to pull off grandiose moves aren't complex, and some attacks are effective enough to repeat over and over without throwing in too many variants--particularly when those reliable combos result in stuns or other such effects. A main drawback to the combat is the targeting. You can't choose your target--only hit the auto-target button and hope for the best. In the early going, this isn't such a big deal. In endgame raid dungeons filled with foes, on the other hand, it's too easy to select the wrong target and pull a group of enemies you'd rather have left alone--especially when the action gets really hectic and your view is obscured by bright flames and jolts of lightning.      Guild Wars, where individuals and groups could exploit their tactical potential with interesting, varied skill sets. And in the same way, playing with your loadouts in DCUO might reveal effective combinations that make you a more helpful teammate. It's too bad that the result summaries that appear at the end of certain player-versus-player matches and group dungeons don't recognize the hard work of those playing a controller role or supporting their team in other ways. (Only healing and damage stats are revealed.)      A big difference between DC Universe Online and Guild Wars, however, is that Guild Wars showers you with new spells and skills even after you reach the level cap, whereas DC Universe Online focuses almost exclusively on gear once you reach the endgame. You can spend some in-game cash and ""respec"" your character--that is, reset your powers and skills and allocate your points elsewhere. But you stop earning experience (and thus, fancy new abilities) once you reach level 30, and unfortunately, you encounter that ceiling very quickly. You could conceivably reach that point after only a few days of play, and even playing casually it might only take a week. The downsides to reaching the level cap so quickly are perhaps obvious to longtime MMOG veterans: a diminished sense of progression and the tedium that arises when exploring familiar dungeons and PVP arenas many times over. And, you can't ease any tedium by exploring the various diversions you might expect to find in an online RPG, such as crafting or a player auction house.       The upside to the compressed leveling curve is that you never encounter content gaps in which you have to search for things to do or grind until you reach the point where new missions become available. Missions come to you fast and furious from the talking-head heroes and villains anxious to push you toward your next task. Or, you might receive assignments from various non-player characters strewn about the cities and elsewhere. Almost all of these characters are fully voiced, many of them rather well. Mark Hamill does an excellent job as The Joker, as he so often does in other games and on television. The mentors all sound quite good, as do a few other lesser heroes and villains. Other voice-overs sound as if they were performed by the local junior high drama club and lack the tongue-in-cheek comic timing of the better performances. The beautiful comic-book cutscenes that conclude instanced story missions and other missions, on the other hand, are consistently superb. Some are funny; others are legitimately moving. But all of them are gorgeously detailed and colored, and they're animated as if multiple cels were layered on top of each other.        The missions themselves aren't as vibrant as the scenes that close them. Kill a bunch of these things and interact with some of these other things is usually the extent of what you do, sometimes pausing to carry this thing over to that glowing spot. These copy-paste objectives can get old, though the mission voice-overs do provide an interesting context to some of these tasks. Villainous objectives are particularly enjoyable, as they often entail doing some horrible thing to an innocent bystander. These mission chains end with the aforementioned instances, where you get a chance to fight alongside a famed hero or villain--or beat up on one. These instances are usually more varied than your other tasks. For example, you might need to destroy computer terminals before Supergirl can utilize them. For even more mission variety, you can join other players in group instances called alerts. Alerts are longer--and more spacious--than story instances and might have you (for example) beating up on HIVE drones, taking down their mothership, and then facing a boss that may not be all that challenging but nevertheless takes a long time to defeat.      PVP arenas and group dungeons send you to a few iconic locales, such as the batcave and Bludhaven, though you will spend the majority of your time in DCUO's two main cities: Gotham City and Metropolis. Missions send you from one hot spot to another in either of these two urban centers at a slick pace, and you won't find any wondrous new vistas when exploring the nooks and crannies. Yet there is a good reason to keep a keen eye on your surroundings. Orbs dot the landscape, and investigating them unlocks little bits of backstory and other narrative scraps to collect. When you complete a themed collection, you earn new loot. There is another good reason to pay close attention during your travels, however: Both cities look lovely. Toxic yellow clouds hover over abandoned parking structures in a darkly lit Gotham. A derelict roller coaster is a stark contrast to the skyline in the distance. Green parks, sunny lighting, and tall skyscrapers make Metropolis a joy to travel in--and above. Some instances--warehouses, offices, and the like--aren't particularly eye catching, and many character models are devoid of detail. Yet these aren't huge faults in a game that excellently re-creates famous fictional cities and then encourages you to gild them with glowing rings of fire and colorful balls of energy.        Whether you prefer to stay solo or group up, DC Universe Online goes out of its way to be friendly. In some cases, simply standing near another player that performs a mission task--successfully defending a pedestrian, for example--gives you credit for the same task. Kill stealing is rare because you get credit for the kill as long as you landed a single hit on your target. Furthermore, your travel options (flight, acrobatics, and superspeed) make it easy to get across town in a relative hurry, particularly if you upgrade your travel method in the associated skill tree. Even when you're on your own, missions stay relatively easy, though the frequency with which enemies respawn can lead to occasional frustration if you're adventuring alone. Of course, you can always group with friends or join a league (DCUO's guild equivalent) if you want company. And you need company if you want to take on bounties, which are familiar, powerful superheroes and villains that pop up in Gotham City and Metropolis. You can also take down opposing players by joining a player-versus-player server, temporarily activating your PVP flag to make you vulnerable to the opposition, or by joining others in the competitive arenas.      DC Universe Online's player-versus-player arenas aren't as potentially unbalanced as those in Champions Online, but stuns and knockbacks are prevalent, so skills that deliver and protect you from such punishment are more helpful than when you're dishing out pain on non-player enemies like OMAC cyborgs. PVP is one of DCUO's late-game mainstays, rewarding you with currency that can be spent on better gear, which makes you more powerful and, of course, then leads to even more gear. Grinding arenas to earn new items isn't the only endgame option, however. Once you reach that upper limit of level 30, you gain access to some of DC Universe Online's more entertaining options. These include larger raid dungeons, new four-person instances, and two-person dungeons called duos. Duos are particularly enjoyable, such as one in Gotham University in which you slash up (or beat up, or shoot up) swarms of mummies and scarabs before confronting a histrionic Isis. If you were hoping for a greater challenge from DC Universe Online, the endgame content is where you will find it. Don't expect to bring down Chemo, for example, without a game plan and a good player in the tank role.        Which version of DC Universe Online you choose to play depends entirely on which quirks you're more willing to endure, though some issues are common to both platforms. Voice chat is a nice feature when it functions, though that only happens to be some of the time. Sound effects sometimes go missing or get muddled when there is a lot going on at once. Neither platform allows you to drop missions or share them with your groupmates. PC players will be immediately struck by the console-focused interface and the overzealous profanity filter, which inexplicably can't be turned off. However, loading times on the PC are zippy, and the game runs smoothly as you soar across the skies. The PlayStation 3 version is noticeably more sluggish. Menus take too long to pop up; the frame rate chugs along every so often, or the game might freeze for a second or two; and the telltale texture pop-in common to games using Unreal 3 technology is all too prevalent. Yet all things considered, the menus are simple enough to navigate using a controller, and the combo-focused combat feels natural on the platform.      These and a few other scattered glitches aside, DC Universe Online is relatively stable at this early stage, which makes it an even more attractive option for anyone who tends to shy away from these sorts of games. If you are one of those people, DCUO's flashy, combo-driven combat and visual pizzazz will draw you in from the beginning and keep you entertained for a few weeks. It's also hard to ignore the license's appeal, which is best showcased in the excellent scenes that play at the end of instanced story missions. Yet DC Universe Online tips its hand early on; in all too short a time, it stops offering any real surprises, remaining approachable but never wading too far from the shallow end of the pool. If you've been around the block and are looking for a new virtual world, this isn't the universe to call home. But if you long to face off with Mr. Freeze or stop The Flash dead in his tracks, this is a fun way to flex your superpowered muscles.      "
2025,Dead Space (2008),9.0,2," Ishimura, engineer Isaac Clarke is dispatched on a routine mission to repair its communications array. However, Clarke is also on a mission of his own, having recently received a cryptic message from Nicole Brennan, a medical officer serving aboard the Ishimura. While on board he intends to reunite with her and learn the meaning behind her strange broadcast. Unfortunately, the moment you set foot on the derelict ship, it's obvious that something terrible has happened.       As Isaac, you are separated almost immediately from the rest of your team by the former crew of the Ishimura, which has been transformed into horrifying monsters called Necromorphs. Forced to fight for his survival, Isaac makes do with the tools at hand to defend himself with, which are for the most part repurposed mining instruments like plasma welding guns or buzz saws. These improvised weapons are put to graphic, gruesome work as bodily damage and even severe head trauma isn't enough to kill a Necromorph--only by severing their limbs can you put them down for good. This nuance, referred to as strategic dismemberment, vastly alters the way combat is approached in Dead Space from the typical ""aim for the head""-style gameplay seen in most action games and zombie apocalypse scenarios.     Every class of Necromorph requires a different strategy to handle, and knowing how to combat multiple types simultaneously is an essential skill if you want to survive for long. Though dismemberment is ultimately the key to victory, failing to finish off a monster properly will only send it into a berserker rage and force it to adapt to its new, partially appendageless situation so that it can continue trying to eat your face. Even more alarming than their ghastly appearances and uncouth manners is the fact that they are quite intelligent. Necromorphs attack in packs using loose team tactics, and are capable of traversing the ship's extensive ventilation system to sneak around for outflanking or ambushing. They feign death among the corpses of their peers to rise up and attack when you least expect it, and they often come in waves, leaving you wondering if it's truly over or if they're simply toying with you.     The most basic Necromorphs are humanoid monsters that attack in a frenzy.  Horribly mutated undead babies also make an appearance, and they run along the walls and ceilings sprouting tentacles from their backs capable of throwing organic projectiles. Others still are heavily armored but vulnerable from behind, are bloated with dozens of spiderlike parasites that are released upon their host's death, or shriek madly as they carry explosive pods toward you in a suicidal charge. In one fully interactive gameplay sequence that comprises some of the more amazing moments to be experienced in Dead Space, you're assaulted by the gigantic tentacle of an even larger, unseen beast that drags you to a gruesome and bloody death as you struggle to shoot yourself free.     Finally, at several key points in the story, Isaac stumbles upon some of the most incredible and truly terrifying boss monsters to be seen in the survival horror genre. Though revealing the circumstances around which you confront these nightmares would do much to spoil them, it is safe to say that these epic encounters are easily some of the most remarkable seen in years.       One of the first things to notice in Dead Space is that it features a complete lack of a traditional heads-up display; instead, pertinent information is integrated directly into Isaac's RIG uniform. To see his current health you need only glance at the iridescent meter built into the RIG's spine (or pay attention to his physical cues), and to see how much ammo is left in your current weapon, simply check the display readout visible whenever you raise it into the ready position. If you ever find yourself wondering where you need to be next, you need only press in the right analog stick for Isaac's RIG to temporarily trace a beam of light on the ground toward your next objective. When called up, menus are holographically projected ahead of you in real time, producing a sense of urgency as you remain vulnerable to attack. These simple yet ingenious systems ensure that you remain firmly within the realm of the gameworld at all times, preserving the horror experience.     Your ultimate goal aboard the Ishimura is to escape from it, hopefully along with Nicole; but to get to that point you must first accomplish a series of dependent tasks. Guided remotely or in person by the remaining survivors of your doomed repair operation, your missions take you from deck to deck in a logical chain of events. For example, early on you discover that the ship's orbit is decaying because its engines are offline, so you must travel to engineering to refuel and restore them. Once they're back online and the Ishimura begins to correct its course, you realize that you're about to pass through an asteroid belt and that the automated defense systems are down, so it's off to do something about that.      Each deck is a self-contained environment in which you run around putting out fires while moving closer to escape, and while your team will remain in frequent contact, you are almost always alone--and most of the few survivors you do encounter have been driven insane by their ordeals. This sense of isolation in such a hostile environment, coupled with bloody visuals and a brilliant sound design, has you constantly questioning your own sanity and wondering when the next attack is coming. Further enhancing this effect are the bone-chilling logs you find left behind by the crew in which their final thoughts and moments are recorded. Though audio logs are nothing new to this type of game and are in fact often used to flesh out the backstory, these are exceptionally well done, and are accompanied by full video logs and text reports, which all together make for a much more compelling narrative.     As you explore the many decks of the Ishimura, you will come across two utilities that will prove to be of endless use: stasis and kinesis. Stasis, a finite resource that must be replenished at recharge stations across the ship or with booster packs, allows you to temporarily slow down fast-moving objects, while kinesis gives you the ability to lift, move, and throw objects in the environment at no cost. Each can be used independently or in tandem to solve puzzles or navigate the ship, and each has useful battle applications as well. For instance, stasis can be used to virtually stop incredibly fast-moving Necromorphs and give you the time to tear them limb from limb, and kinesis can be used to throw explosive canisters or even severed extremities to conserve ammunition.       During your travels, you will find a number of areas that do not have functional gravity. In these situations, Isaac's magnetic boots will keep him grounded and allow you to perform zero-gravity jumps and attach to nearly any surface. Suddenly having a full 360-degree range of movement is a mind-bending experience, but once you get the hang of it, few experiences are as enjoyable as leaping from the floor to the ceiling to dodge an attack and then finishing off your assailant, sending its body, blood, and limbs floating off in different directions realistically. Many of these zero-g situations are also performed within a vacuum, making oxygen, in addition to your health, a scarce commodity.     Between searching for Nicole, trying to escape, and fighting for your survival, you've got your hands pretty full, but this is not to say that there aren't other things for Isaac to do. As the monsters you are killing were once people, they will occasionally drop credits that can be spent in the automated stores you will come across. RIG upgrades, health items, new weapons, and additional ammunition can all be purchased, and if you happen to find a new item schematic and take it to a store, you'll be able to buy that as well. Inventory management is a key element as you can only carry around so many medical kits or plasma cartridges. In the event that you find yourself overburdened, you can sell off your unneeded goods or toss them into the safe for pickup later at any other store location, but you may also find yourself constantly low or out of ammo if you simply go into every enemy encounter guns blazing--sometimes it's better to run and conserve ammo.     As an engineer, Isaac can make use of the numerous nanotech workbenches onboard the Ishimura to upgrade his weapons and equipment. Each upgradeable item has a circuit board arranged like a skill tree, and by soldering in power nodes (typically found in fuse boxes or purchased at the store) down a set of branching paths, functionality can be greatly increased. For example, weapons can have their damage and clip size upped, and Isaac can even increase his RIG's maximum health or the duration of his stasis ability. Fuses can also be used to override certain optional door locks, though, so if you want to be ready for potential secret-item caches, make sure you don't use up all of your power nodes.       From engineering to hydroponics and beyond, Dead Space never fails to impress with its visuals. Whether you're watching the torrential rainfall of asteroids across the hull of the Ishimura from the bridge atrium or witnessing the way a corpse spins serenely in a zero-g vacuum, the haunting yet beautiful graphics of Dead Space have a way of sticking in your mind long after you've quit playing. Semi-interactive cutscenes such as the one in which your team's rescue ship explodes within the Ishimura docking bay simply must be seen firsthand, and the tremendous lighting and environmental effects lay the groundwork for an intense horror adventure.     What really rounds out the entire experience, however, is the incredible sound design. Throughout the halls of the Ishimura, you are stalked mercilessly by the Necromorphs, and while you can't always see them, you are constantly surrounded by the menacing noises they produce or the eerie pitter-patter they make as they crawl through the ventilation shafts. You'll occasionally hear the distant screams of Necromorph victims or the creepy singing of a mentally unbalanced survivor, and environmental effects such as those generated by the sudden release of a burst of steam will keep you on the edge of your seat. Perhaps the most impressive use of audio in Dead Space takes place in a vacuum: any sounds that originate outside of Isaac's helmet are muffled and barely audible, while those from the inside, including his breathing and grunts of pain, are amplified.     Dead Space is a remarkable game from a well-tread genre that manages to stand out from its competitors in almost every way, from visual presentation to engaging story, innovative combat mechanics to fright factor. Whether you're looking for a terrifying horror experience or a deeply story-driven adventure that will keep you engaged for 15-20 hours, Dead Space is a fantastic game that you should not pass on.

1695,Code Name: S.T.E.A.M.,4.0,0,"Smoke rises across the London skyline. On the deck of the United States Airship Lady Liberty, Tom Sawyer, the Not-so-Cowardly Lion, Tiger Lily (from Peter Pan), and John Henry (“the steel-driving man”) watch as a giant robot modeled after (and piloted by) Abraham Lincoln stomps through the streets, clenching its metallic fists. It squares off against a massive creature, all tentacles and pustules and eyes. This diverse group--white, black, male, female, human, animal--have beaten back the alien menace in the streets, and now it is up to Lincoln to deliver a knockout blow. I should love this. Code Name: S.T.E.A.M. is a tactical game that teams up folkloric heroes and public domain favorites and sets them against Lovecraftian invaders in a series of turn-based skirmishes. Really, I should love this. But I can’t because Code Name: S.T.E.A.M. squanders all that potential. A combination of design flaws, technical limitations, and narrative missteps renders what should’ve been a memorable game into something utterly forgettable. A world that should be brimming with character and charm is instead dry and flat. Battles that should feel exciting and dangerous are monotonous at best and frustrating at worst. A world that should be brimming with character and charm is instead dry and flat. These battles make up the majority of Code Name: S.T.E.A.M.’s 20 or so hours. You fly from fight to fight, watch a cutscene, and then direct a squad of four characters through cities, secret facilities, and other locales. Taking a page from games like Valkyria Chronicles, S.T.E.A.M. gives you real-time, third-person control of your characters, one at a time. You are allotted an amount of “steam” (read: action points) based on the character’s equipment loadout. You spend this steam to move from tile to tile and to attack enemies. Like some other recent tactics games, smart play means setting up chokepoints and utilizing a defensive “overwatch” mode to blast aliens once they move into view. You can also use character-specific special abilities (that come with their own unique animations). The whole thing is great on paper, but developer Intelligent Systems fumbles too much of the execution. One example: Though the maps are tiled, you can shuffle characters around inside these tiles without spending any additional steam, so if you park Queequeg (yes, from Moby Dick) behind a giant crate with his final steam point, you can still slide him around inside that tile to line up a sneaky shot (on an alien’s glowing weak point, you hope). The problem is that, while you’re manually lining up these attacks, your targets bounce up and down in an idle animation, drifting in and out of your reticle. And since the game only checks to see whether your attack was lined up at the second you pulled the trigger, sometimes you’re left watching your bullets literally pass through an alien, no damage done. There are other problems, too. Occasionally, an area-of-effect attack or heal might fail to land on one of the targets clearly within its zone of effect. There’s no way to tell whether an enemy is in overwatch mode (this is especially frustrating with a late-game enemy type that is itself immune to overwatch attacks). Then, after spending all that time trying to mitigate these risks, you have to wait for what feels like an eternity for the enemy side to take its turn. Because the view stays locked on your characters, you’re stuck staring at John Henry standing in a corner for 30 to 40 seconds while you vaguely hear aliens moving in the distance. When it’s your turn again, you’re left to swing the camera around wildly, hoping to divine what the hell happened halfway across the map. You have to do this because unlike the aforementioned Valkyria Chronciles, Code Name S.T.E.A.M. never gives you a clear, top-down map view of what’s happening on the field. While you’re manually lining up these attacks, your targets bounce up and down in an idle animation, drifting in and out of your reticle. All of this encourages slow, careful play, not because the tactical challenges are tough and need a lot of thought but because an unpredictable and glitchy result can throw your whole plan into disarray at any moment. It doesn’t help that there is very little encouragement to speed through levels or to take interesting risks. With rare exceptions, there is no urgency in Code Name: S.T.E.A.M., just a slow, dreary march forward. It isn’t just the combat design that’s disappointing. The music is a grating mashup of industrial percussion, thrash guitars, dubstep breaks, and the occasional (and truly out-of-place) flute melody. The maps are boxy and claustrophobic--they all feel like warehouses, even those styled to look like city parks and desert canyons. While your team members are bold, comic-book interpretations of classic characters, the aliens just feel like indistinct blue splotches. Despite their visual flair, even your pulpy heroes begin to wear thin after a dozen hours of hearing the same four or five lines repeated in combat. At the end of the day, all of this could be forgivable if Code Name: S.T.E.A.M. offered something else special. The best games in the tactics genre do this in a variety of ways. XCOM: Enemy Unknown couples the strong combat missions with a smart strategic layer, but S.T.E.A.M. just ushers you from fight to fight. Valkyria Chronicles has interesting progression mechanics for upgrading your troops and vehicles, but in S.T.E.A.M., your characters never level up or change, and though you can unlock new secondary weapons and “steam boilers” by finding collectibles in the levels, 90% of these are totally inessential. Fire Emblem: Awakening--also available on the 3DS--offers hours and hours of fun interactions with a huge roster of characters. S.T.E.A.M.’s story, on the other hand, is a utilitarian structure: the pre- and post-fight cutscenes are beautifully rendered but give little space for the characters to breathe or interact. Code Name: S.T.E.A.M. offers the most frustrating kind of steampunk: It brushes up against potent themes, but then turns its back on them in favor of pure aestheticization. That may be the biggest disappointment of all. Intelligent Systems pulled together an interesting set of figures to star in Code Name: S.T.E.A.M. (including some that were totally new to me, like Califia, the black warrior queen of the mythical island of California). But these aren’t characters, really: They’re just sketches. They’re C-tier Saturday morning cartoon characters. They have great visual design, signature attacks, and a little personality, but that's it. While it’s incredible to see such a diverse range of characters on screen at the same time, the game is also filled with cringe-worthy stereotypes: the Native American who heals with the power of nature; the Pacific Islander who speaks in broken English; the exotic and mysterious Latina. (And before you say that they’re just staying true to the original depictions of these characters, know that one of them is a gender-swapped Zorro. So no, sorry, they aren’t.) More than anything, though, I wish that these characters had been fleshed out more. If you’re going to put John Henry, Tom Sawyer, and Abe Lincoln on an airship together, please do something interesting with them. Every now and then, there is a glimmer of something really cool: a throw-away line hints at tension between John Henry and the non-human members of S.T.E.A.M.; a newspaper clipping notes worker revolts springing up around fears of automation; an evocative reference is made to Lincoln’s “fateful day in the theater”--and his survival of those events. These little hints of flavor kept me interested for a while. I was waiting for some big thematic shift or an interesting twist. Unfortunately, it never came. This is just a story of American do-gooders out to save the world with their near-magical technology. Code Name: S.T.E.A.M. offers the most frustrating kind of steampunk: It brushes up against potent themes, but then turns its back on them in favor of pure aestheticization. When used well, steampunk can be great: Games like 80 Days and Dishonored use steampunk to examine the complexity of emerging technology and massive social change. But in S.T.E.A.M., all we have is American exceptionalism, technological fetishism, and the tiniest dash of diversity training. Yet there is one upside in all this: because all of these characters exist in the public domain, one day, someone will return to this idea. I only hope that they’ll spend a little more time fleshing out the world and its inhabitants. And making a targeting system that works.  "
498,Death Stranding,9.0,2," PC version update: The vast, beautiful, desolate world of Death Stranding lives on PC in top-notch form. After about 15 hours with the game, I'm drawn back into its melodramatic story and unique gameplay loop of cargo delivery simulation and harrowing stealth-action. To reconnect the country in Death Stranding is to also connect with the many players who are doing the same, and through asynchronous multiplayer design, you both engage in rebuilding the world together while helping one another do your in-game jobs.Given the right specs, the PC version of Death Stranding can look and run much better than it did on the PS4 Pro (I played using a Core i7-7700K CPU and RTX 2080 video card). I ran 2560x1080 resolution, as the game supports native 21:9 ultrawide aspect ratio, and every setting maxed out while using Nvidia's DLSS antialiasing option. And through action sequences and heavy weather hikes, the frame rate is consistently in the high 90 FPS to 110 FPS. This is a proper PC port that looks stunning and runs smooth.If you're in the mood for a different style of gaming experience, one that's often relaxing and sometimes incredibly tense, Death Stranding is worth playing. -- Michael Higham, July 13, 2020You can read our original review for the PS4 version, first published November 1, 2019, below.Death Stranding is about America. But your actual goal in setting out across the country is to help people, bring them together, and forge connections, not for the vague concept of America but for the sake of helping the people within it. Death Stranding is unrelenting in its earnestness and optimism--certainly not without its critiques of America, nor without its challenges and setbacks, but inherently hopeful nonetheless. It is a dense, complex, slow game with a plot that really goes places, but at its core, it never stops being about the sheer power and purpose we can find in human connection, and that is its most remarkable achievement.Rebuilding the country is as simple as getting every far-flung city, outpost, and individual onto one network, the bones of which were laid down by a pseudo-government organization called Bridges. As Sam Porter Bridges (played by Norman Reedus), all you have to do to win people over is bring them packages; most people never go outside due to mysterious monsters called BTs, but unlike most people, Sam can sense them enough to sneak past them and get important cargo to its destination.Deliveries can be arduous. You're evaluated on your deliveries across a few categories, but the condition of the cargo can make or break a run, and there are a lot of factors working against you. The landscape can be extremely punishing, from expanses of exhaustingly rocky hills to rivers that are too deep and wide to cross unaided. On top of BTs, you also have to contend with Timefall, a kind of rain that rapidly accelerates aging and deterioration for most of the things it touches. Extended exposure to Timefall can damage or completely ruin your cargo, as can slipping and falling, getting hit by an enemy, or, in some cases, just being a little too rough with it. Even the smallest rocks can trip you up, too. In order to keep your footing, you need to pay close attention to where you're stepping, keeping your balance with the triggers while on rough terrain or when carrying a lot of stuff.Once you reach your destination, though, you're showered with praise. The recipient will likely thank you to your face (albeit as a hologram), and then they'll give you a series of social media-style likes. You're inundated with a multi-page results screen itemizing all the likes you received for the delivery and in which categories, plus an overall rating for the delivery itself, no matter how small--it's positive reinforcement turned up to 11. These likes then funnel into each of the delivery categories like experience points, and as you level up, you can carry more weight or better maintain your balance, among other benefits. Deliveries also feed into a connection rating with each city, outpost, or person, and as that increases, you acquire better gear and sometimes gifts to reward your efforts further.In short, you give a lot and get a lot in return. There is a relatively small number of mandatory deliveries to advance the story, but there's a seemingly unlimited number of optional deliveries, and I often found myself picking up orders destined for any place that was on my way. It's a cycle that's easy to get swept up in; no matter how difficult a delivery or how far the distance, you will at least be met with gratitude, likely feel fulfilled from having completed a tough delivery, and often given a tool to make future deliveries a bit easier. Most importantly, though, increasing your bonds with people is how you get them on the network, and the network is what elevates this core loop beyond the simple satisfaction of completing tasks and getting rewards.The chiral network is a kind of souped-up internet that allows you to 3D print objects, which is incredibly useful and a strong incentive in itself. When at a terminal connected to the chiral network, you can print ladders and ropes for traversal, new boots as yours wear out, repair spray for damaged containers, and basically anything else you need to safely deliver cargo so long as you have a blueprint for it. You can also print a portable printer that builds structures for you out in open areas covered by the network--things like bridges, watchtowers, and generators, the latter of which are critical as you start to use battery-powered exoskeletons and vehicles.The chiral network also grants you access to the online component of the game, which is absolutely essential. You never see other players in the flesh, but their impact is all around you; once an area is on the network, you can see structures and objects left behind by other players in the course of their own journeys, plus helpful signs they've put down just for those who come after them. You can pick up someone else's lost cargo and deliver it for them, too, knowing that someone else may find yours at some point and do you the same kindness.In Death Stranding's best moments, the relief and gratitude you can feel toward someone you don't even know is an unrivaled multiplayer experience. At one point in my playthrough, I was being chased by MULEs, human enemies who love to steal cargo. I was on a bike, tasked with a time-sensitive delivery, almost out of battery and totally unequipped to deal with external threats. In my panic, I drove my bike into a ravine. As I slowly made my way up and out of it, I watched as my bike's battery dipped into the red, and I dreaded getting stuck with all my cargo and no vehicle, still quite a ways away from my destination. I rounded a corner and found myself in the charging area of a generator placed by another player, as if they'd known I'd need it in that exact spot at that exact moment. They probably just put it there because they needed a quick charge, but to me, it was a lifeline.You can give and receive likes for these player-to-player structures, and just like with standard deliveries, it's a strong incentive to do something helpful for someone else. In the earlier sections of the game, I was using other people's structures far more than I was leaving behind help for others. But I wanted to pay it forward and know that my help was appreciated, so I started going out of my way to build structures I myself didn't really need; the map shows the online structures in your instance, making it easier to spot areas you could fill in for others. At first, the likes system seems like a pretty obvious commentary on social media and our dependence on external validation. But it's not so much a critique as it is a positive spin on a very human need for acceptance, and the system does a remarkable job of urging you to do your best for those around you, NPCs and real people alike. Feeling truly appreciated can be a rare occurrence in life, and it's powerful in its simplicity here.The first few hours of the game are the slowest, and a large part of that is because you don't have access to the online component right away. It's an incredibly lonely stretch of time during which you mostly just walk; the work you do early on is especially laborious in the absence of advanced gear, and it serves to give you an appreciation for other players and better gear as you move forward.Even as the gameplay opens up, you continue to get a lot of story exposition with almost no explanation. It can all seem kind of goofy at first, and you can get lost in the metaphors; every city you need to add to the chiral network has ""knot"" in its name, for example, and they are all referred to as ""knots"" on a strand that connects the country. There's bizarre and unwarranted product placement in the form of Monster Energy drinks and the show Ride with Norman Reedus. Guillermo del Toro's likeness is used for a kind of dorky character called Deadman, and there's a woman named Fragile in a game about delivering packages.But the story really does go deeper than that. In keeping with the theme of human connection, each of the core characters you meet and work with has their own story to tell. They all have a unique perspective on death that lends them an equally unique perspective on life, and unravelling their characters, down to the true origins of their often literal names, contributes to the overall tapestry of Death Stranding's take on the human experience. As they open up to Sam, Sam opens up to them in turn, developing into a distinct character in his own right out of the reserved, emotionless man he appears to be at the start. I grew to love Sam, Fragile, and Heartman especially, and even the characters I didn't like as much add to the game's overall message about hope and love in the face of adversity.By far my favorite character--and the most important one--is BB. BBs are infants in pods that can detect the presence of BTs, and they're issued to porters like Sam to help them navigate dangerous territory. You're told to treat BBs like equipment, not real babies, but it's impossible to think of your BB that way. It's full of personality, giggling when happy and crying when stressed out; it even gives you likes from time to time. There aren't many children left in Death Stranding's isolated, fearful world, but BB is your reminder that the future is counting on you, regardless of how you feel about America itself. The love that grows between Sam and BB is nothing short of heartwarming.Connecting with this story, just as with connecting with NPCs and other players, can take work. It's not a story that immediately clicks on a surface level, and the dramatic mystery and off-the-wall science don't make too much sense at first blush. But it's an emotional story first and foremost, and making sense of things--while entirely possible, particularly if you read the letters and interviews that detail small bits of lore as you go--is not as important as reflecting on how it makes you feel.You have plenty of opportunities to do that, too. In the quiet moments of travel, usually as you near your destination, music might start to play. The soundtrack, which is largely composed of one band--Low Roar--is phenomenal, the kind of contemplative folk-ish music that suits a trip alone through a meadow or down a mountain. Because the act of walking is so involved, it's not a time to detach completely and zone out; it's a time to feel your feelings or at least consider what's next in your travels.You can just as soon be ripped out of that headspace, though, by a shift to the haunting music that signals BT territory. The otherworldly growls of BTs as they close in on you can be terrifying, and early on, your best bet is to freeze in your tracks and hold your breath for as long as you can so you can quietly sneak by them. But there are times when you have to fight a BT in its true form, and for that, you have specialized weapons to take them down. These BTs aren't the ethereal humanoid shapes that float above the ground but huge eldritch horrors that screech under clouds of blood. The combat is mechanically simple--you mostly have to move around a bit and hit them before they hit you--but the sequences are visually and aurally arresting.You don't get a gun that works on live enemies until 25 or so hours in, but even then, it's non-lethal. You are actively guided away from killing in Death Stranding, because when people die, their bodies basically go nuclear and level cities, leaving nothing but craters and BTs in their wake. On top of that, the main human enemies are MULEs, former porters just like Sam that have been corrupted by an automated world--they've essentially become addicted to snatching cargo in their desperation to have a job and a purpose as more and more people become replaced by machines. They're not evil, and killing them seems like, well, overkill; it's easy enough to knock them out with the nonlethal methods you continue to unlock as the game progresses. I didn't kill a single one in my playthrough, though punching them is satisfying.While BTs and MULEs are a concern when delivering cargo, there's also Mads Mikkelsen's character, a man who's introduced through memories Sam sees when he connects to BB's pod. He gets his own dedicated segments that punctuate hours of simple deliveries, and these highly contained, much shorter sections are striking in their art direction and juxtaposition to the rest of the game. It's not immediately clear what he is, whether it's an enemy, potential friend, or something else entirely, but he's captivating in his ambiguity.The most cartoonish enemy is Troy Baker's Higgs, a terrorist whose depravity seems to know no bounds. Of all the characters, Higgs is the weakest, with far less nuance to him than anyone else in the cast. He's really just there as a Big Bad to motivate you in a more traditional video game sense than delivering packages and helping people, but he and his band of faceless terrorists are more a means to an end than full-fledged villains. He's the catalyst for some of the major BT fights, and in the end, perhaps an extreme reminder that it's possible to stay hopeful even when things are darkest.Death Stranding argues in both its story and its gameplay that adversity itself is what makes things worth doing and life worth living.Death Stranding is a hard game to absorb. There are many intertwining threads to its plot, and silly names, corny moments, and heavy exposition belie an otherwise very simple message. That comes through much more clearly in the game's more mundane moments, when you find a desperately-needed ladder left behind by another player or receive a letter from an NPC thanking you for your efforts. It's positive without ignoring pain; in fact, it argues in both its story and its gameplay that adversity itself is what makes things worth doing and life worth living. It's a game that requires patience, compassion, and love, and it's also one we really need right now."
4762,Sneakers,3.0,0,"While Microsoft has clearly been gunning for a slightly older demographic since the release of the Xbox, this doesn't mean MS doesn't have room in its game plan for the kids. Originally released as Nezmix in Japan, Sneakers is a simple puzzle game featuring lots of cute, furry mice, and the fact that the game is targeted at the Sesame Street demographic is apparent in its breezy, almost saccharine-sweet presentation. The game's cutesy hook might be enough for the young ones, but anyone with a modicum of gaming experience will probably find Sneakers to be boring and tedious.  Sneakers quickly starts with a group of mice living in a human-sized house discovering that all their cheese has been stolen. Their prime suspects are the dozens of sharp-fanged, red-eyed rats that have been spotted around the house, and so the four mice gang up to search for the rats and chase them out of the house, which is more or less where you come in.     The gameplay is broken down into two distinct portions. Through most of the game, Sneakers plays like a lopsided game of hide and seek. You'll lead your group of mice around the house, looking for rats. When you spot one, you'll press the X button to bring up a targeting reticle and then press A once you have the rat in your sights. Now that the rat's been spotted, he'll disappear into a puff of stars, and you'll move on. Occasionally a rat will be hiding inside a basket or under a lamp shade, requiring you to perform some basic puzzle solving to flush them out, but for the most part, the rats can be found in plain sight. Adding to the game's simplicity is the limited amount of control you have over the mice. You'll directly control which direction the main mouse moves, and the other mice will follow accordingly, but you can only move the main mouse left and right along a predetermined path. You'll find crossroads throughout the game, at which point you can choose a different direction, but that's the extent of your control.     The second part of the gameplay will occasionally pit your group of mice against a group of rats and have the two factions duke it out. The fighting system features a total of six different moves, including a couple of punches and a defensive maneuver. The fighting portion of the game, while not particularly difficult, can be a frustrating endeavor due to the haphazard timing of throwing punches. Neither component of the gameplay is especially challenging or compelling, and though the game can be beaten in two hours or less, it's doubtful most players will want to slog through it to see the end.  The rodents in Sneakers all sport the fur-shading technique we first saw in Rare's Star Fox Adventures, though it was executed to much more impressive effect in that title. The fur shading here looks cheap and inconsistent, and it draws attention to simplicity of the character models. The animation of the mice is limited to a walking/shuffling animation, a running animation, and a climbing animation, each of which appears to be made up of three or maybe four frames. The environments are modeled with a lean number of polygons, though the game does sport some occasionally sharp, realistic-looking textures. The sound design mirrors the game's sunny attitude with a couple of cheery tunes that play at full blast for the entirety of the game. These songs, which occasionally sound suspiciously like music from older Super Mario Bros. games, become seriously grating more quickly than you might suspect.    If the fact that Sneakers is being distributed in the US exclusively by Toys ""R"" Us tells us anything, it's that even Microsoft, the publisher of Sneakers, has little faith in this title reaching anyone outside the 9-and-under crowd. As a digital game of hide and seek, Sneakers might be a suitable diversion for the post-toddler age group, but anyone more discerning will quickly tire of the game's half-hearted presentation and repetitive, simplistic gameplay. "
4149,B-Boy,4.0,0,"  B-Boy seems authentic. This break dancing-themed rhythm game talks the talk, walks the walk, and even knows how to top-rock. But underneath its licensed tracks, motion-captured moves, and fancy lingo, B-Boy suffers from several problems, including bad pacing, repetitive play, and no narrative.     The main mode is Livin' Da Life. There's no context: You're just an anonymous avatar who lives in a really nice studio and dances his or her way to the top of a ladder of respected breakers (those who break dance). You don't have any quirks, aside from the hairdo and the face that you give yourself during character creation. Likewise, you aren't from anywhere. Heck, you aren't even living a life; you're just doing the robot.        More specifically, you're top-rocking, six-stepping, windmilling, and freezing. B-Boy's moves are authentic, and its approach to break dancing is appropriate. The majority of the prompts in this game are beat markers that swirl at your feet; you decide what moves to do and when, just like a real break dancer would.      Your moves are split into several groups, but the most important are ""basics"" and the aptly titled ""moves."" Your four basics are mapped to the face buttons. For instance, if you press triangle, you'll start top-rocking (a basic move). From there, you can execute ""moves"" by pressing a directional button once, twice, or thrice, and then the appropriate face button. Thanks to this simple system, you will have a theoretical understanding of every move in the game well before you unlock them all.       However, this transparent scheme gets awfully confusing due to the fact that you gain new moves individually. So even though you know that ""up, up, X"" is definitely a move, you might not have gotten it yet. This is bad, because attempting moves that you haven't acquired will throw off your rhythm and potentially break up your flow, both of which are big deals in the break dancing world. As a result of this uncertainty, you'll always stick to the streams and the rivers you're used to, which makes B-Boy feel less improvisational than it should.     On top of that, there's the distinction between ""moves"" and ""transitions"" to keep straight. A transition modifies a ""base"" move, and requires only directional button presses to execute. They are automatically unlocked in huge chunks as you play, and they go in your moves list. This should not be confused with your moves book, which is accessible only from the Lab (your apartment, and Livin' Da Life's hub), and it lists only honest-to-goodness ""moves."" The moves list, on the other hand, is an opaque flowchart that is available during practice. It is a spiderweb of stuff that will confuse you, but the worst part is that every move, transition, and base is listed by name, not button input. So to figure out what you can and can't do, you have to go down the list of names, one by one, and check their individual commands. It's not fun, and by the time you reach the end, you will have forgotten which moves you saw at the beginning.         This all takes place, by the way, in your studio. This is where you practice, use your computer, try on different clothes, and check your moves book. Your computer serves many purposes. You get frequent emails offering small gameplay tips, as well as reminders that you've unlocked new moves. This is also where you can accept challenges. Challenges are short break dancing contests that usually pit you against one or a few other breakers. You have a limited amount of time to pull off more cool moves than your opponent, and if you win, you gain respect. Gain enough of it, and you will become the most respected B-Boy on the block.      Your routine is judged according to five possible criteria: flow, rhythm, flair, creativity, and basics. In early challenges, you may be judged on only flow and rhythm; in later ones, you could be judged on all five. To beat your opponent, you don't have to surpass him or her in every criteria, just the majority of them. So, if all five are being judged, you need a routine that will get you a high score in only three of them. This makes it easy to put together a single routine that you can ride to victory after repetitive victory. Sure, you can throw in finishing moves, entrance moves, and taunts, but these are just wrinkles in an otherwise boring pattern.     Outside of Livin' Da Life, you can play B-Boy Jam mode, which lets you set up quick matches of several different types. The nice part is that you get to use premade breakers, so you don't have to worry about whether or not ""up, up, X"" has been unlocked. But regardless of whether you're dancing in a showcase match (timed routines) or an open circle (no time limit, several contestants), you're still trying to outdance your opponents while being judged on certain criteria. By the time you've lived enough of da life, you will also have had enough of B-Boy Jam mode.       Whichever mode you're playing, the graphics in B-Boy are not good. The female avatar faces all look old and leathery, and the urban locales in which you dance aren't very interesting. The motion-captured moves are the bright spot, but even these don't look quite right. The physics feel wrong, as if your dancer were somehow doing the moves suspended in the air and not on the pavement. The licensed music is good, and aside from a few sound effects, it provides the only audible element of the game.      You have to give B-Boy credit for taking a novel approach to a relatively untapped subject. But then you have to take all that credit away for the fact that it has no story, a Byzantine move system, and repetitive gameplay. In the end, B-Boy is difficult to pick up, easy to master, and impossible to recommend.   "
1701,There Came an Echo,4.0,0,"Move. To. Alpha. Three."" ""You're a little too loud,"" the in-game character says, as she fails to react to my command once again. This only amplifies my frustration, making it harder to deliver my next order in a ""quiet and collected manner"" as the loading screen tips suggest. In There Came An Echo's real-time tactical battles, simply getting characters to move to appropriate spots on the top-down map can be an ordeal. That's because the game can be played almost entirely through voice control--aside from using the mouse or the arrow keys to pan the camera, every order can be spoken into a microphone. You can tell your units to move into position, focus on targets, switch weapons, and even queue up actions by following any command with ""On my mark..."". When it all works, the game offers the kind of battlefield commander fantasy that is lost when just pointing and clicking to issue orders with the mouse. In order for it to work, there are so many factors that need to be just right. You need to issue the command at the right volume. You must clearly enunciate every syllable. Your microphone needs to be the correct distance from your mouth. There can't be too much background noise. On top of those, you'll need to spend a few missions calibrating the voice recognition system using the in-game options. Unfortunately, even with all these factors taken into account, the failure rate for voice commands being recognised is high enough to shatter that commander fantasy multiple times each mission. There Came An Echo feels like it has been designed to allow for a degree of non-responsiveness. Characters exchange fire with futuristic energy weapons, whilst coming equipped with shields that absorb a significant amount of hits before you need to start worrying about their safety. Combat isn't fast and brutal; instead, you'll be whittling down health bars at a slow pace that plays nicely into the time it takes to issue vocal orders. Your actual tactical freedom, however, is limited. You do not have direct control over your small squad; they can only be ordered to move to pre-determined waypoints on the map. Those waypoints are placed in obvious locations, and serve to dictate the way in which each encounter will play out. You occasionally have the opportunity to flank units and whittle their health down faster, or switch between slightly different weapon types, but by the time you're able to get the voice recognition system to work, the encounter is usually over--the enemies are dead, or all your squad members are down. The failure rate for voice commands being recognised is high enough to shatter that commander fantasy Though the voice commands are There Came An Echo's primary method of control, the same orders can also be issued with the mouse. You have no greater direct control over your units, however. Instead, you simply select text versions of the same voice commands from a radial menu. It's evident that there is no deeper quality to the game's tactical engagements when the problematic voice control system is removed. Once the novelty of having your voice recognised by the game wears off, there is little here to propel you through each mission. The cutscenes that bookend each encounter don't fill that void, either. Though the voice acting is above average, the writing has characters constantly bickering and arguing over nothing, regularly cutting each other off and telling each other to ""shut up"" both in and out of missions. It feels like a woeful imitation of Archer's screwball character comedy antics. This dialogue also jars with the otherwise dark and serious nature of the convoluted plot, which deals with issues of over-surveillance and paranoia through excessive techno-babble. Though the plot is poorly delivered, it provides an appropriate context for the role you assume as the omniscient commander. There is an eerie sensation when you realise your PC is actually listening to you. Unfortunately, far too often, it simply isn't."
2471,LEGO The Lord of the Rings,8.0,2,"            If you decide to temporarily put your main quest on hold, or if you keep playing the game after clearing the final story stage, you'll discover a variety of simple but entertaining diversions. Your main way to kill time is to seek out white mithril blocks so that you can give them to a blacksmith in the village of Bree who can then construct new equipment for your characters (provided they also bring him blueprints that are obtained within story missions and by completing side quests that non-player characters occasionally offer). Sometimes, you discover those pale blocks as you navigate the world, and you only need to climb a tree or explore a cave to retrieve them. In other instances, you may need to race through a short checkpoint course, or defeat a certain number of enemies within a set time period. You can consult your map to find the location of nearby blocks or to meet up with the unlockable characters that start wandering the map as you advance through the campaign.            There are also some great boss battles and set pieces, many of them unique and surprisingly ambitious (in particular, watch for a few cool scenes involving elephants). The frequency of such highlights means that the game is more than just a standard puzzle or action game with a Lord of the Rings skin. Sometimes the developers' ingenuity results in stages that aren't particularly enjoyable a second or third time around, though. In those cases, it's possible to bring new characters to familiar environments. Those characters can usually find secrets that were previously unavailable. Just like that, the familiar becomes interesting all over again.   "
4016,World Tour Soccer 2006,5.0,1,"  Despite some lackluster performances in recent years, the World Tour Soccer team hasn't given up on achieving some kind of result against the likes of EA's FIFA series and Konami's Winning Eleven games on the PlayStation 2 playing field. Like both of those series' latest installments, World Tour Soccer 2006 primarily looks to improve upon its predecessor through the introduction of new features and subtle gameplay refinements. Unlike those series' latest installments, however, World Tour Soccer 2006 ranks as one of the worst soccer games to appear on the PS2 to date, for reasons that will soon become clear.        It says a lot about World Tour Soccer 2006 that the most significant new feature you'll find in the game is its EyeToy Cameo support, which lets you stick something that vaguely resembles your own head onto an in-game player. The Digimask-powered process is surprisingly simple, and provided you set your EyeToy camera up in an appropriately well-lit area, it's actually possible to create a reasonably pleasing 3D likeness of your head, complete with freakish facial animations, within just a few minutes. Something strange happens between the initial creation of your 3D head and its first appearance in-game though, and more often than not your would-be doppelganger will boast either a ghostly white or a slightly unnerving purple complexion when he steps out onto the pitch. You can create a custom team composed entirely of EyeToy Cameo players, incidentally, but since each cameo weighs in at 685KB, when you save it you'll need an otherwise empty memory card to do so.     Other new features in World Tour Soccer 2006 are few and far between, and we're sorry to report that most of the flaws we noted in our review of last year's game not only are still present, but are now joined by a host of all-new ones. For example, you'll still get to stare at a loading screen for almost a minute before every match (longer if you want to use EyeToy Cameo players), and you'll still find that you can quite effortlessly walk the ball from one end of the field to the other on at least two of the game's four difficulty settings. Replays of goals are generally so short that you don't get to see the strike (let alone any of the buildup), and you'll certainly notice that your occasionally inanimate and mostly useless CPU teammates have little more than their names and their hairstyles in common with their real-life counterparts.     New problems in this year's game, or at least those that are more pronounced now, include referees that are always very slow to react to incidents, goalkeepers that are often even slower to react to incoming shots, players under your control occasionally refusing to make contact with the ball, an inconsistent frame rate, and commentators that often deliver repetitive and inaccurate information. Like a stopped clock, the commentators aren't always wrong of course, and occasionally they'll come out with some real gems, like ""This is a semiprofessional league match between these two representatives of the semiprofessional league,"" which, although poorly written, is certainly accurate. There are ""school league"" and ""professional league"" variations on that particular quote, both of which you'll be hearing a lot of if you're brave enough to tackle World Tour Soccer 2006's career mode.      This year's career mode is largely unchanged from that in World Tour Soccer 2005, which means that before you're able to compete in professional leagues you'll have to play through and win both school and semiprofessional seasons. For those of you who like numbers, this means that before you're able to compete against professional teams and check out the transfer market, you'll have to play almost 50 matches using a team composed entirely of players whose overall skill ratings are lower than 10 out of a possible 100. Worse still, when you make it to the professional leagues (you can choose to play in one of 23 from around the world), you'll still be in charge of the same school team that you started out with. Your players will have reached at least 16 or 17 years of age by that point, but their skills in the professional stadiums will be no better than when they were competing on school playing fields.      Fortunately you'll receive around $7.5 million with which to improve your team when you become a professional manager, which we found was more than enough money to add several decent players to our squad. There are more than 19,000 real-life players in World Tour Soccer 2006, so there's never any shortage on the transfer market. The search engine you'll use to find players that you're interested in is adequate rather than great, and sifting through the attributes of players on your short list can be a time-consuming process. This is in stark contrast to the actual transfer deals, though, which can see new players joining your squad within a few seconds of your submitting an offer. Occasionally you might find yourself becoming embroiled in a bidding war for the services of a particularly talented or promising player, but for the most part the deals are uneventful. There's not even any mention of a player's wage demands when you sign them, which is particularly unfortunate given that their services don't come for free.        So, can we think of anything good to say about World Tour Soccer 2006? Of course. Some of the stadiums and new player animations look really good (though the pitches and crowds don't), the option to change your team's tactics on the fly is still great, the game's soundtrack isn't awful, and the arrows that appear around the edge of the screen to show you where your offscreen teammates are would make a great addition to any soccer game that doesn't already feature them. We're also pleased to report that your CPU opponents in World Tour Soccer 2006 hardly ever use the deliberate dive button. World Tour Soccer 2006 also boasts some interesting unlockable content that you'll gain access to via a club shop and tokens system, including additional stadiums, amusing sound-effect packs, and plenty of classic, super, and all-star teams.      World Tour Soccer 2006 is a game that's even more difficult to recommend than its predecessor, not only because it's inferior in many ways, but because its competitors have improved their games significantly in the last year. Perhaps the most disappointing (and surprising) thing about World Tour Soccer 2006 is that it's vastly inferior to the recently released PSP World Tour Soccer game, which not only plays a better game of soccer but also features a style-based challenge mode that's infinitely more enjoyable than that on the PS2. Last year we likened World Tour Soccer 2005 to an overweight soccer fan who wears a replica uniform and dreams of joining his heroes (FIFA and Winning Eleven) on the pitch one day. This year, that guy is still doing pretty much the same thing, except his replica uniform is a season out of date and starting to smell bad.  "
1207,Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun,8.0,2,"With a trio of assassins, I prepare to breach the outer gates. I make one of my assassins toss out a tasty flask of sake to distract a guard, while another slit the throats of two unwary henchmen nearby. The third, a sniper, perches in a high tower and finishes off the remaining enemies. A few moments later, we're ready for the shogun--our real target.Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun is an elegant answer to a simple question: How do you make sneaking unnoticed from Point A to Point B compelling? Many games have built themselves around that concept, but few stealth-focused games manage to make sneaking as interesting as Gears of War makes shooting or Portal makes puzzle-solving.tThat's because the language of games, for better or worse, is usually conflict. But stealth games call for a subtler hand. Often you'll have to wait for enemies to be in the right place at the right time to make your move, and if you step out of turn and accidentally blow your cover, you may have to say goodbye to your progress and start from scratch.Shadow Tactics can be challenging, but isn't as punishing as most stealth games. From the very beginning, you're taught to save--constantly. If you go more than a minute without saving, a timer appears onscreen to remind you, growing more intense with each passing minute. Once saving becomes a habit--executed with a single keystroke--you grow more comfortable trying out creative strategies without fear of risking hard-fought progress.Shadow Tactics frontloads almost all of the training you'll need for the remainder of the campaign. You have five different assassins under your control, each with their own specific skills. Some can target two or three enemies in a single turn, while others can vault up onto rooftops to gain the upper hand. By the end of the first level, you'll have working knowledge of every major tactic and ability at your disposal. After that, it's just a matter of which specific combination of abilities you'll be able to bring to any one level.From a serene, wind-swept snowscape to the towering castles of Japan's Edo period, Blades of the Shogun's cel shaded environments are all beautifully rendered, and each one introduces a distinct mechanic that alters the rules of stealth. Guards will track footsteps through snow on one map, for example, ratcheting up tension and forcing you to be more rigorous in your approach. With its rules in flux, Blades of the Shogun is consistently tense and challenging, forcing you to plan and react in new ways as you pursue one target after another.At times, the complexity of any given level--with potentially dozens of guards and obstacles--can seem overwhelming. But no matter how dire things appear, there are systems in place to give you a fighting chance. You'll never be surprised, for example, by a guard's sudden attention. Their cones of vision gradually fill with color--they confirm your location when it's full and sound an alarm to summon reinforcements. In the brief amount of time it takes for an enemy to take action, you have a chance to get out of trouble, either by throwing a shuriken or quickly ducking out of sight.If you do trigger an alarm, however, a swarm of new enemies appear and stick around for the rest of the scenario. This presents a series of interesting choices for you to make. You can, if you so choose, take the spike in challenge in exchange for removing one or two particularly pernicious henchmen. They may be replaced, but the newbies won't pick up the exact patrol pattern or position, so, in some cases, it's still worth it.No matter how dire things appear, there are systems in place to give you a fighting chance.Sudden turns also help develop the relationships between Shadow Tactics' five main characters. They'll trade barbs and anecdotes as they tell one another about how they came to this line of work and why they chose to fight. Party members range from the sturdy samurai, Mugen, to the lithe master of disguise Aiko. Hayato is the de facto leader, a dyed-in-the-wool ninja and master of stealth. The thief, Yuki, is faster and lighter, relying on traps and tricks to take down most foes. Last is Takuma, a wise old man and a patient sniper.Each of their abilities can be chained into the skills of other characters, requiring extremely tight coordination. Over the 20-hour-plus adventure, they grow and learn together as they face mounting challenges and an uncertain future. The story isn't groundbreaking by any means, but the repartee is relatable and earnest, providing sufficient context for the adventure.Across thirteen dense, beautiful areas that can each take a couple of hours to work through, you'll pick and probe, chopping through complex patterns against what seem like impossible odds. If there's one complaint, it's that while each of its parts work together seamlessly, it can often feel like there's only one correct solution--like you're trying to find the solution to a puzzle instead of working within a living, breathing world. However, those frustrations are blunted somewhat by ever-present tension, as you'll often face unexpected twists that prevent you from feeling too comfortable.Shadow mode, as the game calls it, leads to glorious moments where you get to see all of your hard work, your observation, and attention to detail pay off. It tests your ability to keep track of all the moving pieces in a level and put a plan in motion. You can have a samurai kill off a small band of guards with his special ability, then snipe an officer as he moves in to investigate. Then you can have your other characters stash the bodies to avoid detection--all before the next set of troops rounds the corner. When a plan comes together, it's a thing of beauty--a symphony of action.Shadow Tactics understands what makes stealth games so special. It pushes you to organize your own plans such that you’re never seen at all, living up to Thief's thesis that masterful warriors are ghosts that wreak havoc on the unsuspecting. And it takes this concept step further, giving you enough options to ensure you're never trapped or stuck without recourse. Shadow Tactics' basic ideas are masterfully executed, making it one of the best stealth games in recent memory."
1746,Call of Duty,8.0,2,"    While far from perfect, Call of Duty is exactly what real-time strategy lovers want in a mobile game. It is a thinking-man's shooter, packing thrills for grognards (serious wargamers) and casual fans alike. Simply put, its team-management features and level designs are visionary. It's a highly recommended game.  "
3499,The Sims 3,8.0,2,"     By comparison, the rest of daily sims life is pretty mundane. You'll wake up, go to your job (which is represented in the game as little more than a daily paycheck), and spend the rest of your hours managing your needs and wants. You'll have to click on the toilet and shower to freshen up, as well as make yourself meals or visit a restaurant to stay fed.     The Sims 3 has no real story. Instead, a series of goals will randomly occur to your sim like, ""Hey, I've always wanted to kick over the trash can on the corner."" These random tasks are the only concrete direction the game gives you; otherwise, you're on your own. Two of the goals are unique to your personality. For example, a sleazy sim will want to make ""woohoo"" (the game's euphemism for getting to know someone in the biblical sense) eight times a day and juggle three relationships at once. While the 73 general goals provide a bit of outside motivation, you can't manage the order in which they're received. You also can't delete a goal once you commit to it, and the only way to clear it off your list is to achieve it. You can save up to four goals at once, even though some of them can be difficult to achieve early on in the game.       This review was provided by GameSpot mobile content partner SlideToPlay.com. "
940,Bridge Constructor Portal,4.0,0,"The story in Bridge Constructor Portal is little more than a collection of references to the previous Portal games. GlaDOS is back to make light of your shortcomings, but her insults feel like diluted copies of familiar quips, lacking the clever tongue-lashings that she used to so easily dish out. She's there to greet you with an insult at the beginning of some stages, and then you're left on your own in a bleak and bland test chamber. Periodic cutscenes borrow familiar artifacts from previous games, but do little with these props other than make you fondly remember happier days. During one such segment, a picture of Portal's famous cake appears on a computer screen while an instrumental version of ""Still Alive"" plays over the loudspeakers. This scene means nothing if you aren't familiar with that game...and it's just a quick nostalgia jab for those who are.As the name implies, Bridge Constructor Portal has you building a series of bridges in the facility made famous in Portal. The goal is to guide a self-driving forklift full of cute little stick figures from the entry point to a faraway exit--all while avoiding turrets, leaping over acidic lakes, and triggering switches. Building a bridge is no easy task, though; physics are a constant and punishing presence, forcing you to consider the impact of gravity as you build rickety structures. With only metal planks and guy-wires to hold your contraptions in place, you have to make smart use of your materials to ensure that the entire structure doesn't topple as soon as you begin.A handy ""best practices"" tutorial teaches you the fundamentals of architecture. Build a series of triangles, for instance, to hold a bridge in place, or affix an arch to add even more support for your road. Bolts in the ceilings and walls can bear a lot of weight if you hook guy-wires up to connecting points, but make sure you balance the bridge properly, or it's still going to cause your forklift to crash and burn as soon as it lays its wheel upon the road.All of the techniques you need are doled out slowly, so it's easy to get a handle on what the game is demanding of you. While you start out building simple ramps and roadways, you're soon sculpting hundred-piece structures that dangle impossibly high in the air. The early going is tense: I would hold my breath as the forklift sauntered across my swaying bridge, hoping that the guy-wires were strong enough to carry the weight. My forklift would often land on a bridge from too high a distance, and I would watch helplessly as it all toppled to the ground. Then it was a matter of going back to work, adding a few more supports and tweaking the angle of ramps, before once again testing my creation.It doesn't take long, though, before you've seen all of the obstacles Bridge Constructor Portal can dish out. Once you've mastered suspension bridges, oscillating bridges, and angles of incidence, the stages force you to go through the motions to show--once more--the tricks you already learned. The game tries to keep things fresh by injecting obstacles and items from the original Portal game into this one; you'll encounter talking turrets, companion cubes, speed goo, death lasers, bounce pads, flying balls, and (of course) portals. Later levels throw all of these into a single stage, but that only makes the experience more tedious, not more interesting.The game often confuses complexity with fun, as throwing in more moving pieces doesn't mean you're going to have to think harder.Bridge Constructor Portal is at its best when it focuses on one or two key ideas. Figuring out how to use a companion cube as a shield to block the laser attacks from a turret took enough clever construction that I was satisfied when my forklift glided gracefully through the exit. But the game often confuses complexity with fun, as throwing in more moving pieces doesn't mean you're going to have to think harder. Rather, it means you're going to spend most of your time making small adjustments, wallowing in small details instead of appreciating the greater whole that surrounds you.The best part of puzzle games is figuring out how to overcome a tricky obstacle. That's the easiest and shortest aspect of Bridge Constructor Portal, though. Long after you've devised a way through the portals, off the bouncing pads, and past the lasers, you're fiddling around with one small part of the contraption that is close, but oh so far, from the necessary perfection.A lot of the tedium comes from how editing works. In test chamber 49, for instance, I had to guide my forklift through a series of portals on the right side of the screen while crashing into turrets from behind, and hitting a button that would release a companion cube on the left side. The cube is supposed to knock down three more turrets and hit a switch that opens the exit. The problem is that I couldn't quite get the angle needed to guide the cube to its destination. So I would tweak a ramp, start the level up, and then wait 30 or so seconds until the forklift hit that switch to release the companion cube. Then, I would watch the cube fall, see where my mistake was, and move a ramp a few more pixels to try to get it in the right spot. And then... I'd start the whole process again. Tweak, wait 30 seconds, tweak, wait 30 seconds, tweak. There's no way to start a run from a certain point to iterate on the one problem area, so I went back and forth with this project for a half hour until I finally got it right.And then the game crashed.From beginning to end, it took me about an hour to pass test chamber 49. Most of the later stages take 30 minutes or longer to get right, and some took even more than an hour. Losing my progress after spending so much time constructing the perfect series of ramps and bridges was maddening. But I had no time to pout: I jumped right back into test chamber 49, moving quicker than my first time through, and got my trusty companion cube to knock down the turrets and trigger the exit door in about 20 minutes.And then I ran into an even bigger problem.Test chamber 50 is much easier than the previous stage, but I experienced a bug every time I reached the exit that forced the game to crash to the Switch OS. I tried to save my work before exiting, crossing my fingers that I wouldn't have to start from the beginning if the game crashed again--but the save function failed consistently, too. So I never got beyond test chamber 50, and never saw the last 10 challenges.Obviously, a game-breaking bug is a serious problem, but I was tired of Bridge Constructor Portal long before my progress was abruptly halted. This game falls short in just about every area; an amusing story or eye-catching visual design could have at least distracted from the dull puzzles, but you get no reprieve here. The game doesn't even feature any music while you're building the many bridges. Long after you've figured out how to pass a stage, you're still left tinkering with minute portions, adjusting ramps by mere pixels at a time, crossing your fingers that you landed on the exact angle needed to guide a companion cube or bounce a ball of light toward the wall trigger. Instead of testing your puzzle-solving ability, Bridge Constructor Portal just sees how long you can withstand tedium before you want to walk away from the whole endeavor. Editor's note: GameSpot was informed by the developer that the game-breaking bug mentioned in the review has now been patched. Our original review will remain as is, as a reflection of the game at the time it was released. - Peter Brown, March 27, 2018, 7:30 AM PT "
2191,Rocksmith 2014 Edition,8.0,2,"They say old habits die hard, and in the case of the humble guitar player, never has a statement rung so true. We crave guitars that were crafted in the '50s, amplifiers that run on glowing vacuum tubes, and yes, everything being cranked up to 11. So anything that challenges the status quo in the grand world of guitar playing has got its work cut out for it--and in the case of Rocksmith 2014, a learning tool sprinkled with video game tropes, it's very much an uphill battle. Certainly, getting into Rocksmith's unique way of teaching guitar is going to be a struggle for anyone who has been playing the instrument for a good amount of time, particularly if you're a fan of using guitar tablature. Instead of reading the notes from left to right like in tab, the setup is like a more complex version of the classic Guitar Hero games. A runway of note blocks scroll from the top to the bottom of the screen, each along a path that corresponds to a particular fret number, with colour coding signifying which string to pluck. With practice, I got used to this setup, but with 12 years of guitar playing and tab-reading habit gnawing at my brain, it was never as comfortable as I'd have liked. Similarly, Rocksmith's default way of teaching isn't going to be for everyone. Rocksmith uses an adaptive difficulty level where the song is played at full speed, but only a few notes are displayed at a time. Nail those notes, and more are added in, until eventually you're playing the whole song. It sounds like a great idea, and in some cases it works. With simpler songs, such as Foo Fighters' ""Everlong"" and Muse's ""Knights of Cydonia,"" it's relatively easy to gradually add in more notes as you play, thanks in part to not having to worry about quick position shifts and dense passages. The initial starting notes are well chosen too, with your fretting hand placed in just the right position to add in those extra notes as the difficulty ramps up. But for more complex songs, the limitations of this system become clear. I could easily play the simple version of Slayer's thrash classic ""War Ensemble,"" but as the extra notes got added in, the difficulty curve wasn't smooth enough to make playing them at full speed on the fly possible. There simply wasn't enough time to process those new notes and physically memorise where my fingers needed to be before notes had flown by and a new passage had started. In the old Rocksmith, there wasn't much you could do except grin and bear it, but thankfully Rocksmith 2014 introduces a much-improved version of Riff Repeater, which lets you highlight sections of a song and slow them down to a more acceptable pace. You can set up a speed trainer too, so that a section gradually speeds up as it loops, and set the difficulty to whatever you like so you get all those notes at once. This is far more akin to how a guitar player would traditionally practice a difficult riff or solo: learn all the notes, but play them at slow speed and then speed it up. This new version of Riff Repeater is such a great feature that it's unimaginable to go back to the old Rocksmith and learn songs without it. That said, it can still be a little clumsy, particularly for really complex arrangements where you want to read ahead and get the notes under your fingers and locked in your head before attempting to play them along with the song. The top-to-bottom setup means that not a whole lot of notes can be displayed onscreen at any one time, and you can't simply scrub through to a section you want either. Being able to display whole sections of the song at once in a tab-like fashion would have been a great addition here. There's a firm line drawn between the silliness of the Guitarcade minigames and the main song-learning modes. There are times when Rocksmith's note highway trumps the traditional tab, though. Notes that need to be held are displayed as long streams of colour, palm muted notes have an X struck through them, ornaments like vibrato give notes a wavy look, and glissando stretches them out along the fretboard. These are traditionally difficult things to convey via tab, but here they're easy to read at a glance. Plus, if you're not familiar with a given technique in a song, Rocksmith is packed with excellent tutorial videos for beginners that teach you everything from smooth hammer-ons and pull-offs through to squealing pinch harmonics and tapping. Useful for beginners and seasoned players alike is the Guitarcade, which teaches techniques like string skipping and bends via a range of 8-bit-style minigames. Escaping a chasing police car by playing Phrygian scales in Scale Racer, or shooting cowboys by skipping strings in String Skip Saloon is a lot of fun, and the minigames are genuinely useful for nailing some of the fundamental skills of guitar playing. The only real slipup here is Hurtlin' Hurdles, which asks you to tremolo pick as fast as you can to run down a racetrack, and then mute the string to jump over a hurdle. Unfortunately, the game doesn't respond as quickly as it should, making this mode far more frustrating than fun. There's a firm line drawn between the silliness of the Guitarcade minigames and the main song-learning modes, with Rocksmith finally embracing the fact that it's a teaching tool above all else. There's no career progression, for example, nor are any of the songs locked behind some arbitrary score wall. This is exactly as it should be. You're free to learn at your own pace, and the game simply makes some recommendations about what lesson or song to tackle next. The fact that you're learning an actual instrument and playing real songs is all the incentive you need to keep going. Speaking of songs, the lineup here is much improved over the original game, with tracks that have been chosen because of great guitar work, rather than some unnecessary need to slot in a big-name artist. They're also much trickier on the whole, with the likes of Joe Satriani and Iron Maiden pushing your skills to the limit. Beginners are still catered to with artists like Bob Dylan and the Arctic Monkeys, but the emphasis is on melting faces with killer licks, which is frankly what the vast majority of guitar players want to do. You can put those licks to good use in Session mode, which features a virtual band for you to jam with. It's not the best-sounding band in the world, and some of the chosen chord progressions are a little odd to say the least, but if you stick with the 12-bar blues, there's some fun to be had. Like in last year's game, there are a few technical issues that get in the way of rocking, most notably with the audio setup, which all but requires you to feed audio directly into an amp via analogue cables. Do it any other way, and the lag between your playing and the sound emerging from the speakers is far too distracting for the game to be playable. It's a shame the resultant guitar tones aren't quite worth the effort. Played along with a song, they're not too bad, but in isolation, they sound fizzy and overprocessed. And try as I might to create something more acceptable in the tone designer, I couldn't rig up anything that sounded less artificial. When I bashed out my first clumsy Green Day chords on guitar, I'd have killed for as good a teacher as this. These idioscyncrasies aren't enough to sour what really is a great learning tool for beginners, and a big improvement over the original game. The problems that I had with the layout of the note highway are going to be far less of an issue for those without years of tablature indoctrination, and the tutorials and song selections are good enough to teach you a lot about playing guitar. Rocksmith isn't going to be replacing the likes of a keen ear, a copy of Guitar Pro, and a good set of tabs for me, but when I think back to when I bashed out my first clumsy Green Day chords on guitar, I'd have killed for as good a teacher as this."
795,SNK 40th Anniversary Collection,8.0,2,"The full extent of developer Digital Eclipse's efforts is difficult to know from the sidelines, but it's recognized among gaming historians that the team holds itself to a very high standard and often succeeds at meeting it. Beyond programming emulators, it also helps track down relics--original arcade motherboards--when the source code has been confirmed lost by SNK, in addition to scanning and restoring marketing materials that tell the story around the games at the time. Regular maintenance can keep old arcade boards alive, but with dwindling numbers of working units in the hands of private collectors, there's a feeling of ""now or never"" when it comes to preservation. The SNK 40th Collection is a treasure trove of classics that heeds the call.At launch, there are 14 games to play: Alpha Mission, Athena, Crystalis, Guerilla War, Ikari Warriors, Ikari Warriors 2: Victory Road, Ikari III: The Rescue, Iron Tank: Invasion of Normandy, P.O.W., Prehistoric Isle, Psycho Soldier, Street Smart, TNK III, and Vanguard. For some of these games where there was an NES home port of the arcade original, you get both versions to compare and contrast. It's a great lens with which to examine the mindset of the day, where everyone wanted to bring the arcade experience home and people were willing to accept compromised graphics and gameplay to get there.A perfect example of this is Ikari Warriors, one of a few proto-twin-stick shooters in the collection. As evident by the included console port, when the game made the transition to the NES, you could only shoot in the direction you were moving, rather than independently, as you would in the arcade game. Now that the collection is on Switch with two analog sticks to handle the controls, we are that much closer to having the true Ikari Warriors arcade experience at home. The game actually used a single arcade stick that had an added rotation function, but short of releasing a new peripheral to exactly replicate the stick, Digital Eclipse has gone as far as possible to achieve what consumers wanted when Ikari Warriors was on everyone's radar.While there are a lot of solid games on hand, there are no doubt going to be games that are more interesting in theory than in practice. Given this, it's nice to see that each game--minus some NES ports--has an autoplay option. This will not only make it easy for you to examine a game with ease but also gives you the chance to tag in when a game gets good. Disengaging autopilot and taking the wheel isn't the smartest way to learn how to play any game, but if you find yourself up against a difficult section, you can also trigger the rewind button to fix mistakes and undo accidental deaths.The 40th Anniversary Collection gives you a lot to play and many ways to tailor the experience to your whims, including settings that come in handy while playing vertically oriented games. From a technical and experiential standpoint, it's an all-around great collection. And if everything goes according to plan, Digital Eclipse has 11 more games scheduled to arrive before the end of the year via free patches and DLC.In the meantime, if you exhaust interest in playing what's around, there are a lot of special features to explore. Scans include assorted marketing sheets and advertisements but even go so far as to include independent fan zines from the '80s and arcade game guides. For a more in-depth peek into the past, every game released by SNK between 1978 and 1990 gets a neatly animated history lesson, complete with screenshots and interesting anecdotes that help tell the overall story of SNK's formative years. And if you want to just zone out to some nostalgic music, there are soundtracks for 12 of the games in the collection ready from the start.Digital Eclipse proves once again that it's the right team for the job of both preserving and resurrecting classic video games. For SNK and its fans, the team has elevated some of the company's most important milestones. It's responsible for more than just Neo Geo games, and though not every game that came before is worth replaying on its own today, the addition of supplemental materials and revitalizing modern gaming conveniences make them feel more interesting than they have in years, and in some cases, decades."
4117,Casper (1996),4.0,0,"Casper the Friendly Ghost has been around for ages, appearing in comic books, cartoons, and even a 1995 motion picture. This film spawned a number of video games, and now - five years later - Interplay is releasing one more, Casper for Game Boy Color. Just as in the film, it's up to you to guide Casper in his quest to befriend Dr. James Harvey and his daughter, Kat.    To gain the Harveys' friendship, you'll guide Casper through a 50-plus-room mansion in search of many conversation-inducing trinkets, all while foiling the antics of his three ghostly uncles. Being an action RPG, the game is portrayed in a top-down view reminiscent of Zelda DX or Quest for Camelot. Control is simple: Move with the D-Pad, use items with the A/B buttons, and check inventory or a map with select or start. As the game progresses, you can even transform into alternate forms, such as a puff of smoke, a beach ball, or a saw blade. The game's save feature provides four save slots, leaving ample leeway for you to make mistakes.    Casper is a game meant for younger audiences, and the gameplay reflects that. Right after the opening cinema, you're already in a room containing food items and a brass key. Contrary to popular belief, Casper can be injured, and a 100-point life meter is all that stands between our hero and his final resting place. Bump into an uncle, contact a raging fire, or use a morph, and you'll lose one life point. Thankfully, food items are plentiful, so dying isn't a major possibility. In fact, the brunt of the game's difficulty lies in solving various puzzles: pushing the right buttons, completing paintings, or positioning statues. Unfortunately, the puzzles are kindergarten level in simplicity and more plentiful than booth girls at a trade convention. Seasoned gamers can blow through the game in less than two hours, provided they don't mind triggering more than 100 switches, completing five paintings, and tapping the B button relentlessly.   Visually speaking, Casper is no Van Gogh. In fact, it's not even a Klimpt. Each of the mansion's many rooms are drawn in the same repetitious style, leaving one wishing that an abuse of primary colors was punishable by law. While the game has some interesting backdrops, namely the attic areas and front lawn, everything else is painfully symmetrical. Character sprites are surprisingly good. Casper wisps about as you'd expect him to, his uncles are easily distinguishable from one another, and the Harvey family resembles a Norman Rockwell painting. While the game contains plenty of cartoon-rendered cutscenes, one can't help but reel from the overall simplistic nature of the visuals. Casper is no Zelda, that's for sure.   Considering the target audience, Casper's features, gameplay, and visuals are adequate, but one aspect of the game is enough to drive a person insane - the sound. There is one music track. Not two, not three, but one - and it's pretty tedious at that. There's an option to turn the music off, but then you end up with mind-numbing silence. At least the sound effects are decent, getting the point across without sounding tinny.   Overall, Casper is a game seeking the right audience. For children from age 5 to 12, many fun hours of friendly haunting await. For adolescents and adults, however, there are better choices in the genre, namely Nintendo's Zelda DX or the upcoming Crystalis. Casper's two hours of total gaming isn't for everyone."
4032,Real War: Rogue States,5.0,1,"Real War: Rogue States is the follow-up to a pretty bad real-time strategy game. But since there was room for improvement, developer Rival Interactive had a perfect opportunity to go back and address some of the original game's shortcomings, though apparently, the developer didn't take care of all of them. Although Rogue States does fix several of Real War's problems, the original game's biggest problems remain.   Last year's Real War had a poor user interface and terrible AI. That game's story involved US military forces going overseas to battle terrorists, and it was notable mainly for its bad timing, since the game was released a few weeks after September 11. The subject matter in Rogue States hasn't changed much. You could certainly say that some of the game's missions--for example, those involving the use of Apache helicopters to hunt down Scud missiles tipped with biological contaminants--are timely. And if Ben Affleck can do it in The Sum of All Fears, then searching through an American city for a nuclear bomb counting down to detonate must be OK for a real-time strategy game. Rogue States' box even borrows President Bush's language about an ""axis of evil."" However, it's still unsettling, when you're playing Rogue States as the Independence Liberation Army, to load terrorist units into trucks or airplanes and then drive the vehicles into an enemy building for a suicide attack, all the while hearing them confirm the orders in Arabic. It's hard not to find this sort of thing to be in poor taste. It's also hard to believe that most of Rogue States' audio is lifted right from Real War, including the same canned sound effects and the same voicework from Full Metal Jacket star R. Lee Erney.   Rogue States features two playable factions: the United States and the Independence Liberation Army, an amalgam of terrorist groups with access to heavy weaponry. Although each side has a couple of unique weapons, their arsenals are largely identical. However, Rogue States does add some new units. Both sides get a medic to heal injured infantry units, a flying drone to scout enemy positions, and an amphibious attack transport. Rogue States also has some new planes, including a hardy C-130 gunship, the B2 stealth bomber, and some advanced fighters. The most notable additions are the new base defenses, including rocket, machine gun, antiair, and artillery emplacements. More than anything else, these make a big difference in how Real War plays, since you won't have to divide your limited army between offensive and defensive duties.   Rogue States has some useful new hotkeys (although it should have more), and the graphics and animation have been cleaned up a bit since the last game. Units move a little more convincingly and don't routinely march right through each other like ghosts or shuffle sideways as if they were on ice. You can also select camouflage patterns for your units. Ironically, this is mainly useful to make them stand out better against the terrain. In addition to a new seven-mission campaign for each side, Rogue States features beefed-up skirmish and multiplayer modes. There are loads of new options for unit restrictions and resource availability, as well as some clever maps and new game types. Rogue States' improved resource model encourages control of certain points on the map to improve your income. You can even play games in which allied human players control the same side, sharing command of their units.     Then again, it's difficult to recommend playing Real War: Rogue States in the first place. If you're a glutton for micromanagement and punishment, then this is the game for you. The game's interface has changed only slightly since the original Real War. Rogue States still requires a lot of careful clicking on tiny moving units, indecipherable pictures, or little icons. The game's unit formations and new AI settings aren't very helpful, because the AI simply doesn't work. Units stand around while they're being attacked. Oftentimes, you'll have to manually target an enemy to get your units to react to taking fire, but even then, your units will occasionally just ignore you, as if they're on some union-mandated coffee break. In fact, Rogue States' pathfinding is just as bad as Real War's.   An AI this bad completely undermines the gameplay. In fact, you could say that having to deal with Rogue States' frustrating AI is a bit like playing a multiplayer game with some guy who keeps breaking up the game by walking away from his computer to grab a snack from the kitchen--even though you're all set and ready to play, something that's out of your control keeps disrupting the experience. Considering that there have been several other real-time strategy games this year that are much more highly polished, solid, and enjoyable, you'd probably be better off spending your time and money elsewhere."
4538,Billiards (1999),4.0,0,"Billiards is another of Agetec's value-priced software releases for the PlayStation. As evidenced by its no-nonsense title, Billiards is a 3D pool-hall simulation, and it features such varied modes of play as nine ball, eight ball, bowlliards, and rotation. All of the classic modes are true to the rules of their real-life counterparts and play relatively close to the real thing. You shouldn't expect a flashy presentation from Billiards, but sadly, you won't receive much enjoyment, either.  Billiards includes a number of different modes of play and other options that, while well intentioned, are unimpressive in execution. For example, you can select a CPU opponent represented by a cartoon caricature for the single-player games. This opponent's text window will utter a challenge in an introductory screen, but during the game, your foe is absolutely silent. You can unlock new opponents, but they all remain entirely lifeless, so there really isn't any reason to do so. There are three tables to choose from, each in a different locale, such as a bar where the backdrop includes paintings and a full liquor display. The environments are flat textures, however--the only polygons in this game are used to represent the cue and balls. The included trick-shot mode lets you master 18 different trick shots, including fancy bank shots and multipocket combinations. The ability to watch the computer's example of how to successfully complete the trick is nice, and after a certain amount of practice, making these shots can become second nature and rather satisfying. The background music is fairly entertaining in some areas, particularly the jazzy piano in the trick-shot game, but the tunes eventually become horribly repetitive. Getting a good view of the table is crucial in a billiards game, and despite the many camera controls in Billiards, the only way to get a passable look at the table is to use the game's full-screen overhead view, which is functional but unattractive. The inability to properly view the entire table will make playing complete games a thoroughly frustrating affair. The developers behind Billiards were clearly aware of the visibility problems, because they included a command for changing all the ball graphics to large numbers. This would have been a perfect remedy for the problem, if overlapping balls didn't keep it from working half the time. Another problem many players will have with Billiards is the nonintuitive, clunky control scheme. Billiards lets you use either the standard-line or a relatively well-done ghost-ball tracking system for lining up shots. The precise control over the cue ball and realistic physics ensure that if you miss a shot, it was because you lined it up poorly. Sorely lacking in the otherwise solid control, however, is analog support for the Dual Shock controller. Not being able to smoothly pan the camera in and out or position the cue ball when in hand is a major annoyance, to say the least.  Despite the game-design flaws in Billiards, it is an affordable title that may competently entertain the casual game player. The difficult camera takes getting used to, but all things considered, Billiards is a fairly accurate simulation of a game that has rarely translated well to video game consoles. For most billiards enthusiasts, however, the money spent on this game would be better spent playing a real game of pool."
4112,The Golden Compass,4.0,0,"  The Golden Compass owes a lot to 2005's The Chronicles of Narnia. Like Narnia, it is a game based on a film based on a fantasy novel, and it even goes so far as to summarily lift hunks of gameplay directly from the older title. Yet for some reason, the designers picked all of the bad stuff while leaving behind the good. The result is a muddled mishmash of gameplay ideas that lacks focus and certainly lacks any sense of fun.        If you aren't familiar with the accompanying film, or the Philip Pullman novel on which it's based, you will probably be rather confused by the game. As Lyra Belacqua, you seek to save your friend Roger from the grasp of evil folkloric kidnappers known as Gobblers. Lyra is accompanied by her daemon Pantalaimon (or Pan, for short), who is the physical embodiment of Lyra's soul, and she is occasionally joined by a hulking armored polar bear named Iorek. Lyra also possesses an instrument called an alethiometer--the golden compass of the title--which can answer any question that she asks it. You'll figure out what's going on in bits and pieces and with the help of short clips from the Golden Compass film. Yet you'll likely never care about Lyra or her companions, and important chunks of exposition are completely glossed over, leaving you wondering what's going on or why you should care.     Gameplay is a mess. There are a lot of ideas at work here, but none of them pan out all that well. First up: exploration. You spend a lot of time roaming about doing busywork, particularly in an insanely long and boring sequence on the Gyptian vessel. The highlight during this level is--get ready for it--mopping the deck. In other levels, these tasks may have you hiding under furniture or throwing snowballs, but none of them are interesting, and they are generally sliced up by cutscenes and other gameplay mechanics.     Platforming ushers in more mediocrity. Granted, there are some nice ideas here. Lyra can use Pan as a grappling hook and latch on to poles for simplified Prince of Persia-inspired swinging, and the duo can glide for short distances. There are also beams to keep your balance on as you cross, though these moments seem to take forever, since Lyra walks across them so slowly. The controls are super-loose, which is deadly on the dock level--one of the dumbest platforming sequences ever dreamed up. Not only do the slippery controls make Lyra a pain to maneuver, but you can't manually control the camera, which makes it impossible to judge distance. Even worse, the camera has a tendency to move on its own in the middle of jumps and balancing acts. Expect to reload this level countless times, while cursing the designer who created it.     The Golden Compass relies heavily on timed button sequences, already one of the most overused mechanics in modern-day games. Attacked by a giant bee? Press some buttons in the right order. Need to push over an ice bridge? Press some more. Even some boss fights are won in this manner. There is some action buried in here, though it's found mostly in the game's first and final levels. Playing as Iorek, you'll paw through three types of enemies: witches, Tartars, and wolves. Once you build up enough rage by using standard melee attacks, you can pound the ground to do extra damage. You can also hold two buttons down to grab an enemy and fling it around, but for the most part, you can defeat this tiny assortment of foes by mashing a single button. Some levels are capped by boss fights, which aren't hard, but thanks to the lack of player camera control and the shoddy hit detection, they're plenty annoying.     There are still more elements at play. Sometimes Lyra will try to deceive other characters, which requires you to perform a set of minigames. Some of these games function properly, at least, such as one where you push the left analog stick in a whack-a-mole variant. Others are simply terrible and are so poorly explained that you may have no clue how the minigames even work the first few times they appear. There's also the matter of the golden compass itself. Lyra can ask it questions, and the accompanying minigame consists of keeping a reticle centered on the compass with the left analog stick while executing (you guessed it!) another timed button-pressing sequence.        Even the visuals can't capture the fantasy magic of the film or novels. Animations and environments are crude, textures are muddy, and there is absolutely no imagination to be found in the bland art design. There are also some weird graphical bugs, such as blinking polygons and pixelated seams. Sound fares no better. The musical score is fine, if unmemorable, but most sound effects are either embarrassingly clunky or missing entirely. The voice acting is serviceable, but there are times when the same character will talk over his or her own dialogue.     Initially, the wide variety of gameplay elements make it seem like there's going to be a lot to do in The Golden Compass. Unfortunately, most of these facets are too repetitive, too frustrating, or too boring to keep anyone's interest, young or old. So, perhaps unsurprisingly, the game is just the latest in a string of movie tie-ins that sacrifice good gameplay for the sake of a quick buck.    "
4453,Burnout Legends,4.0,0,"  The fact that Burnout Legends for the DS bears the same name as Burnout Legends for the PSP (which is easily one of the best racers ever put on a handheld system) may be one of the most unfortunate circumstances of the year. It's not because anyone would expect the DS version to be just as good as the PSP one--after all, the hardware capabilities are vastly different and so directly comparing the two games would be unfair. What is fair would be to expect something that actually resembles Burnout in any kind of meaningful capacity. The Burnout games have always been about high-speed racing, ridiculous crashes, and pure, visceral thrills. Burnout Legends for the DS has exactly none of these things. The racing is pathetically underwhelming, the crashes are so painfully halfhearted that they might as well not even exist, and a wide variety of graphical glitches and collision problems turn the whole thing into a serious mess.        The first time you boot up Burnout Legends, you might be tricked into thinking that the developers behind this game actually got it right. The menu systems are a good approximation of what you've come to expect from previous Burnout versions, and all the main car classes--like compacts, muscle cars, coupes, and sports cars--are on hand. Many of the tracks and courses found in the PSP version are available as well. But as soon as you get into an actual race, the whole thing crashes and burns.      There's a multitude of reasons why Burnout Legends isn't fun to play, but the biggest and most glaring one is that the cars just aren't much fun to drive. The car handling has this really bouncy, off-kilter feel to it. When you bang off of a wall, you either seem like you're sucked in and stuck there, or you bounce off in this really cartoony way that looks seriously unnatural. The same goes for other cars. They'll bounce and jerk around the track like you were playing a particularly laggy online game. And for a game that's all about crashes and doing massive damage to your opponents, the crashing sure is broken. You can literally just run up behind a guy and rear-end him, and somehow that will cause a takedown of his car. But other times an opponent's car will just clip through ancillary traffic on the course, or even your car when you're trying to pull off an after-touch takedown. The whole after-touch effect is completely insane, actually. The physics are just broken, so as soon as you go into slow motion after your car has been wrecked, you'll see the burnt husk of your car as it starts to dart around much too quickly in whatever direction you pull it in. And when your opponents wreck into the scenery or into other cars, they don't look so much like they've crashed as they do like they've simply merged with the scenery. How in the world do you make a game based on crashing and collisions with broken collision detection? What god would let that happen?     Another big problem is that the game really doesn't have much speed to it. It's not the frame rate--in fact, that's the one thing that is actually done pretty well. It's that the scenery just doesn't seem to move by at a particularly brisk pace, and boosting somehow makes things even slower. Burnout games, by nature, have to be fast to succeed, so you can see why the racing here falls so very flat.     Basically every race type found in the PSP version is on hand here, but they all fail for the reasons cited above. Every race is too slow to be fun, everything involving takedowns suffers at the hands of the weak crash physics and clipping issues, and the crash mode is like some kind of cruel, unholy joke. The whole point of the crash mode is to create ridiculous pileups of cars for morbid thrill (and lots of cash). When you're physically incapable of creating wrecks larger than a small handful of cars, and the crashbreaker effect looks like a pathetically dainty whirlwind of mediocrity, how can you possibly hope to get anything out of such a mode? You can't, and won't in the DS's rendition of the crash mode.     It also doesn't help matters that the game looks and sounds awful. However, the one visual aspect that is handled well are the tracks. They look pretty good running on the DS hardware, and while the textures are certainly blurry up close, as you're driving along it all looks OK. At least, until you see the nasty fade-in effect with the background environments. There's a big wallpaper texture in the background, and all the background track stuff fades in over it as you drive. The problem is that this fade-in starts from being invisible and then fades completely in, and slowly at that. So you get these ugly spots where the buildings and the wallpaper background are clashing with one another, and it looks just really rotten. Speaking of rotten, the car models are unfathomably ugly. They're lazily designed, nasty to look at, and the crash effects are just plain bad. So to recap, in a game where crashing is king, the developers spent the time making the tracks look good and skipped out on the cars and the crashing. Right.         As for the audio, all the sound effects are pathetically subdued. The Burnout series has always had excellent sound effects, and here they're barely noticeable. Crashes clang with miserable effect, the car engines all sound the same, and bad at that, and the soundtrack is just a collection of lousy, MIDI-sounding techno tracks. After Tony Hawk's American Sk8land did such an excellent job of bringing licensed music into a DS game, there's really no excuse now for not creating some kind of real soundtrack when porting a game (which has traditionally used a licensed soundtrack in multiple previous iterations). It's just lame.     Burnout Legends for the DS is not a failure because it's a port of a game that appeared on a more powerful system. It's a failure because it just isn't an enjoyable racer, regardless of platform and regardless of name. The fact that this languid excuse for a racer bears the Burnout name does make it all the more egregious. But even apart from the sullying of that series' reputation, every single thing this game tries to do comes off as half-baked and worthless. If you want a Burnout game, buy any other Burnout game ever made, and leave Burnout Legends for the DS very much alone.  "
2551,Jet Set Radio (2000),4.0,0,"     Jet Set Radio relies heavily on its presentation and it doesn’t always stress the details. Stages end abruptly once you tag all available points (marked by red arrows), not when you achieve a certain score or defeat a challenging boss. The energetic beats looping in the background and the vibrant cel-shaded visuals have always been the primary reasons to keep playing, and those elements are especially effective now that all of the familiar artwork has been upgraded for high-definition televisions. Most of the original music also returns. Players discovering the game in 2012 may wonder what they’re missing, though, because there’s not a lot to savor beyond the funky presentation.     Jet Set Radio's most regrettable issue is its simple but somehow ineffective control setup. As your skater cruises through the various areas, even the simple act of skating in a straight line can sometimes prove difficult if you're not grinding a railing, because you have to hold the analog stick forward to build speed. The tiniest nudge of the analog stick can wreak havoc, since your skating graffiti artist is prone to wide sweeping movements rather than more precise motions. Yet if you need to change direction slightly while flying through the air (usually because your skater launched unexpectedly toward one side or the other rather than pushing forward in the anticipated straight line), fiddling with the analog stick often has almost no effect at all.                In a few other stages, your skater's goal is to tag members of a rival gang with paint. The environments where you must do so are built to slow you down at every turn. In the first such mission, the cowardly goons skate along a sewer pathway that includes stairs, pools of murky water, and an enclosed passage that is littered with piles of immovable barrels and equipped with a trapdoor in the floor. Your job is to direct your skater as he or she races after those foes--who all move with an easy grace that most human players will never reproduce with their skaters--and spray them from behind several times. Until you memorize the stage layout in its entirety (along with the route your rivals follow), you don't stand a chance.     Not every stage is frustrating in the same way, and there are moments when you find yourself having some fun, but each new environment presents an exasperating wrinkle of some sort. The most common stage objective simply asks your skater to roam around and tag key areas while avoiding an ever-increasing police presence. Such levels begin with almost no resistance at all, which gives you time to gather paint cans (since your graffiti-loving skater always starts with none on hand). After you tag a few locations, though, you have to avoid tear gas, dogs, SWAT teams, a trigger-happy captain, helicopters that fire missiles, and other similar hazards. That had the potential to be exciting, but the finicky controls and ineffective camera make it difficult to track the location of your enemies until they're pelting you with bullets, grenades, or missiles.       "
1526,Mad Max,6.0,1,"There's a good reason why the new Mad Max game occasionally resembles this year's Mad Max: Fury Road: it's a canonical prequel that pits you against Scabrous Scrotus--son of the film's sinister Immortan Joe. Mad Max's wasteland is greasy and dusty, a place where mechanical monstrosities clash against the natural beauty of the desert. You play the part of Max, an unfortunate wanderer with a troubling past. You charge across open roads in search of redemption, running over those who stand in your way. Driving is central to life in the wasteland, and it's the basis for the game's best moments, too. The combination of an intriguing world and great car combat make Mad Max an occasional joy to play, but shallow ground combat and a handful of other missteps ultimately drive the game off the road. At the start, you find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time when you're assaulted by Scrotus and a pack of his sinewy war boys. They steal your beloved car, the Interceptor, leaving you empty-handed. However, fortune smiles upon you when a Gollum-like mechanic by the name of Chumbucket crosses your path. He's convinced that you're a hero of legend, the ""Angel,"" and he's a whiz with both a wrench and a harpoon, making him the perfect companion in the hard-driving and violent wasteland. You and Chum fend off desperate tribes and push back against Scrotus' forces as you take contracts and hunt down fresh parts for your new chariot, the Magnum Opus. Your ultimate goal is to build a vehicle that's strong enough to cross the void known as the Plains of Silence, where you'll either find freedom, or death on the other side. Together, Chum and Max are fast and lethal in the Magnum Opus, with Chum manning a small cache of weapons in the rear while you steer the car. Picking apart enemy vehicles and guard posts is a cinch with your harpoon, which is the most important weapon in your arsenal. While driving, press one button to slow down time and highlight nearby objects and people, and press another to launch a harpoon or explosive lance. Alternatively, you can tap the circle button to auto-fire at the closest target, but it's an unattractive option when it's vital that you target specific objects; there's no point in ripping off a car's tire when you can just as easily yank out the driver. It's normal to be confronted by three or four cars at once, and though some carry enemies that will try to hop onto your car, you can purchase spikes to deter hop-ons, resort to your trusty shotgun, or pull over and fight it out with your fists. Even when surrounded by enemies, you're an effective and brutal fighter. Watching Max man-handle thugs can be entertaining, but the part you play--controlling Max--isn't very interesting or rewarding. Mad Max's combat borrows from Warner Bros.' recent Batman and Shadow of Mordor games, where mashing one button dishes out contextual attacks, and another, when pressed while an icon appears over the head of an attacking enemy, initiates a parry maneuver. You can attack using your shotgun, but you rarely want to because bullets are hard to come by. You also have the ability to roll and evade incoming attacks, but only a few enemies ever justify the effort. The combat system is so simple at its core that nearly every fight can be won by alternately tapping attack and parry, save for a few boss battles where unblockable attacks are introduced. Watching Max make quick work of enemies is occasionally impressive, but when the majority of fights in the game can be easily exploited, there's no challenge to overcome, and no sense of accomplishment. When put side-by-side with car combat, which is complex, full of possibilities, and requires precision and skill to succeed, Mad Max's ground combat feels shallow. Mad Max also doesn't do a good job of imposing desperation upon you, a feeling that is necessary if the wasteland's threats are to be taken seriously. It's true that water, fuel, and food are hard to come by, so when you find a can of dog food, you eat it. When you come across a family of maggots feasting on a corpse, you take advantage of your rank in the food chain. Water can come from many sources, but never in large supply. Eating and drinking are the only ways to revitalize yourself in the game, but you quickly learn that carrying an empty canteen isn't that scary. For one, beyond the occasional barrage of explosives that come from fortified camps, you rarely face dire situations, and though it may seem like you would need to rehydrate from time to time because you're going full-throttle in the middle of a hot desert, I never noticed any gradual, deleterious health impacts from exposure. Emergent vehicular battles in Mad Max's open world can jeopardize your car, but Chum quickly fixes it whenever you aren't moving, and a generous fast-travel mechanic lets you magically skip the experience of driving through enemy territory. It may be convenient, but adding fast travel to Mad Max is like adding a ""skip"" button to a fighting game that automatically takes you to the next round. You can purchase new parts for the Magnum Opus and upgrades for Max that impact your abilities and appearance. You earn new car parts from the leaders of various regions, either by completing fetch quests or dismantling enemy outposts. After a new part is unlocked, you have to purchase it using scrap metal that you collect around the world. You'd think that any old metal would qualify as scrap, but you'd be wrong. You can occasionally collect large amounts of scrap by taking an enemy car back to base, but you normally acquire it from glowing piles of metal that are sparingly strewn about the wasteland. These piles can include items like a muffler, which you conveniently stick in your pocket. I suppose it's helpful that you can carry multiple cars worth of metal on your person, but it doesn't make much sense. We don't mind this in games where fantasy trumps reality, but Mad Max tries to sell you a world where characters are defined by their abilities and limitations, yet it constantly introduces things that contradict this message. It's also disappointing that Chum can't help you collect parts while you're driving the car. He can hang on to the back when you're driving incredibly fast, and repair the Magnum Opus when it's falling apart, but he can't hop off and help you gather items. Having to stop the car, get out, pick up the pieces, and get back in before hitting the road is a frustrating process that slows you down and exposes you to nearby enemies. It may be convenient, but adding fast travel to Mad Max is like adding a ""skip"" button to a fighting game that automatically takes you to the next round. As you perform certain feats in the game, such as killing multiple people using your car or pulling down enough sniper towers via harpoon, Max's reputation rises, and he can pick up new gear, facial hair, clothing, and an upgraded shotgun. More importantly, Max can increase his efficiency as a scavenger by trading in coins to a mystic that resides on top of certain cliffs. He's an odd duck, but like Chum, his peculiarities add to the world's mythology in a great way, as he speaks of your past and buried emotions. Save for a mother and daughter duo that you meet briefly towards the end of the game, this if the only time Max's past is a topic of discussion. The mystic always departs by blowing noxious powder in your face, putting you in the proper state to receive his ""gifts,"" such as the ability to magically receive bonus portions of water when you refill your canteen from the game's limited water sources. The mystic is a worthy cast member, but his gifts stand in the face of your struggle to survive. A character stat shouldn't determine how much water you get from a small pail in the desert; the pail itself should. There are similar issues found throughout Mad Max, in fact. Fuel, like ammunition, is a rare commodity, or at least it should be according to the story. Oddly, it's not unusual to find fuel cans that repeatedly respawn in front of your eyes. You'd also think that being run over by a car would kill you outright if not seriously injure you, but Mad Max puts more weight behind the punch of a withered nomad than it does a three-ton war machine. If you're playing sloppily during a fight, a few punches is all it takes to bite the dust. Stand in front of oncoming traffic, however, and you can endure getting run over five or six times before you start to worry about your health. In fact, I got so good at being struck by cars that I eventually learned (unofficially) how to jump into the windshield of an oncoming car and perform a triple-misty-flip, landing gracefully on my feet. It's impossible in theory, silly to witness, and easily repeatable. You can also stand in fire without getting hurt, but only some fires; experience taught me that a burning car in the open-world isn't as hot as a flame-thrower that blocks your path during a mission, for example. Other rules are randomly imposed upon you by the game that take away your freedom with no justification within the story. You have a large, boundless open world to explore, but venture off the map for a few seconds, and a warning screen tells you to turn back, or its ""game over."" A particular mission wants you to explore an underground tunnel, but if you try to navigate narrow corridors on foot, rather than in your car, a similar warning screen appears. An open-world Mad Max game should force you to contend with the wasteland's harsh elements, but also give you the freedom to go where you please. Mad Max fails to mix story and gameplay with finesse, but there are elements of the game that stand out as impressive, nonetheless. Raging, electrical storms set a new bar when it comes to weather effects, as fast winds carry tons of dust and debris. The chaos creates a deafening and blinding atmosphere that's occasionally illuminated by lighting bolts and the fires they light on the ground. A late battle forces you to chase down a convoy and dismantle Scrotus' massive war rig. Regular car combat is fun, but the scale of the war rig and the relentless nature of Scrotus' horde make this battle truly memorable. You pick off small fries one by one as you try to keep up with the war rig. Occasional breakdowns may cause you to pull over and repair your car, which makes the chase all the more thrilling. The story sequences that follow attempt to teach you the cost of pursuing your dreams in the land of nightmares, and it's the best moment in the game's story, though that's not saying much. Soon after, however, dead characters are magically brought back to life and your journey continues onward. The ending, like many of the game's minor faults, devalues your struggle to survive in the harsh wasteland. It's a shame because Mad Max's world in the game is beautiful, grim, and fascinating. Some interesting characters, impressive environments and great car combat draw you in and incentivise you to keep going, but it's when you get out of the car that things fall apart. Mad Max's combat system is too dumbed down to enjoy, and repetitive activities such as searching for scrap and invading small enemy camps gets old fast. Mad Max offers some great experiences, but for a game that tries to impose the realities of survival on you, it does a poor job of following up on this pressure. Mad Max is too focused on providing you with an open-world that's filled with missions, and not focused enough on making those missions worth your time."
2427,Shattered Haven,5.0,1,"      The tutorial puts you in control of the kids, who are beckoned to the farm's gate when a survivor begs for sanctuary. You're taught to fight back against encroaching grays, not with headshots, but with iron (which is poisonous to zombies), water, and fire. The game is played from an overhead perspective, and you navigate its maps in real time. Items like iron spikes, lanterns, hammers, and bear traps can be picked up and thrown, dropped, or swung using hotkeys. Most levels include shrubbery, some of which can be chopped down using the appropriate items, and water, which is navigable with a raft or a canoe, for example. Offensive items are usually limited, so proper deployment is crucial.                Another wonderful level drops you deep into a fog-covered swamp. The goal is to kill just one gray and then escape. You take one quick step before dozens of hidden zombies maul you. On the next attempt, you move more slowly, navigating your way through a crowd of still but hypersensitive undead. On the other side of the swamp you find a grenade, which, unlike a melee weapon, is sure to attract every enemy in the vicinity. What are you going to do? The game uses your failure to teach you a lesson, which you overcome, and just when you expect mercy in the form of a quick, quiet weapon, you're confronted with an explosive new predicament.           "
3132,Rio,6.0,1,"Fuzion Frenzy and the Mario Party games comes Rio. Rio tosses the vibrant avian stars of the animated film of the same name into a host of simple minigames. Not all of the games here will hold the interest of even young players for very long, and Rio fails to capitalize on its film license, squandering its story and giving its characters short shrift. But young players (and their parents) will find some enjoyment in the better minigames here, and the reasonable $30 price makes its shortcomings a little easier to overlook.     If you've spent any time with party games, everything about Rio will feel immediately familiar. You, and hopefully one to three friends, progress through a series of games simple enough that brief instruction screens before each one tell you everything you need to know about how to play them. There are 43 games in all, but don't take that to mean there are 43 entirely different types of experiences to be had here. Many of the games are very similar to each other, and they can be grouped into just a few categories.        There are some basic rhythm games in which the characters dance or play a musical instrument, and you need to push a thumbstick in a certain direction in time with onscreen prompts. These games move at a pace that most players of any age will find easy to keep up with and some will find too easy to be interesting. Then, there are shooting galleries in which you move an onscreen reticle to target fireworks or marmosets. The fireworks minigame is absorbing because your score multiplier increases each time you score a hit and gets wiped out if you miss, which encourages you to take shots carefully. Shooting marmosets is much less interesting. The screen is constantly filled with the animals, so you just move your reticle around and fire as much as possible, which quickly gets old.     In some games, players drop fruit from a high ledge onto marmosets or onto another player below. Being the one the other players are targeting is exciting; you dodge left and right and try to mislead your opponents about which direction you're going to head in next. But dropping fruit from above is less engaging. The camera is too far out to give you a clear view of the action, and when targeting marmosets, there are so many creatures and so much movement down below that it's difficult to keep track of who's hitting what. As a result, there's little satisfaction to savor when the watermelon you toss strikes true.     A number of games are variations on musical chairs. You and your competitors run around trying to collect as much fruit as possible, and when the music stops (or when villainous cockatoo Nigel appears), you scurry into a hiding place or leap onto a perch. As in actual musical chairs, there's a rush of excitement when the time comes for everyone to hurry to safety and someone is left in the cold. A few games are pure tests of your reflexes. One, which is conceptually identical to a game in Fuzion Frenzy, places you atop a moving vehicle and requires you to press buttons to leap over and duck under obstacles. Another has you and the other birds flying down a street, moving up and down to avoid fire hydrants, awnings, and other hazards. These modes start out slowly and progressively get faster and faster, ratcheting up the excitement as players are eliminated until only one is left standing.        The largest group of games are those that put you and your rivals in a small, contained area. These have you collecting fruit while avoiding an incoming tide; collecting fruit while jumping over a rope; running around and throwing snowballs, mud balls, or soccer balls at each other; or doing some other simple activity to try to earn the most points. These games move quickly and control well, making it satisfying to snag those bananas and mangoes from an approaching opponent or nail your friend with a soccer ball to the beak in dodgeball. Power-ups that provide brief score multipliers, speed increases, or other benefits like stealing points from a competitor lend the action an element of unpredictability without being frequent enough to make the contests feel purely like games of chance rather than skill.      There are a number of ways to play Rio. A Story mode loosely follows the events of the film. You play a few games in a given location and then a character from the movie updates you on your standings and tells part of the story before you move on to the next location from the film to play a few more games. The characters who narrate the story--Luiz the bulldog, Mauro the marmoset, and Nigel the cockatoo--repeat sections of dialogue so frequently that kids may be reciting them along with the characters before you've even finished it once, making this mode one you won't want to return to after completing it. Carnaval Wheel mode has players spin wheels to determine which game will be played next and the point value of that game. In Garland Gala, you earn garlands based on your performance in the minigames and then toss them at targets to score points and determine the game's victor. Carnaval Dance has you competing with other players to get a certain number of marmosets into your conga line, and it awards you four marmosets for each first-place finish in a minigame, three for each second-place finish, and so on.     The problem with all of these modes is that the selection of games you play is random. Initially, this is fine, but before long, you've seen all the minigames and inevitably will prefer some to others. For this reason, Party mode, in which you can create custom games with whichever minigames you want to play and lets you compete as individuals or on teams, is likely to be your go-to mode. There are also quiz variations in Party mode. In quiz games, players are asked questions between each minigame, with correct answers contributing to your position in the standings. These multiple-choice questions cover both places related to the movie (""Do you know which country Minnesota is in?"") and specific plot points from the film, which make them as much a test of whether you've seen the movie as they are a test of knowledge. Additionally, repeats start cropping up in these questions after just a few games, so you won't select the quiz variants more than a few times.       Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, have used their characters to great effect, Rio's failure to capitalize on the source material feels like a missed opportunity.      There's no online support here; you can only play locally. Given the game's party vibe and target audience of young children, this isn't much of a setback. It's the sort of game that ought to be played with people in the same room. Not every minigame is a winner, and they could have benefitted from more charm and personality, but there's enough family-oriented fun here to make this good-natured game an enjoyable diversion.  "
2653,Fable Heroes,6.0,1,"Castle Crashers. Unfortunately, Fable Heroes never comes close to reaching the highs of that downloadable juggernaut, and even in its best moments it feels like it's three steps behind gameplay developments that have kept the genre alive. While it's not without its fun moments, Fable Heroes is a mere novelty that never establishes itself as a worthy offshoot of the traditional Fable adventures.        A whimsical artistic style carries over from the original Fable games to this downloadable spinoff, although instead of hacking and slashing with the familiar heroes who look like refugees from a Disney flick, you race through each level with three friends or non-player characters as rag dolls modeled after Fable favorites. They're cute, but their chirpy voice emotes lack the personality of character voices in the original games. Elsewhere, you might be amused by balverines and hobbes that look cuddly enough to put in a baby's crib, but it's hard to escape the impression that this would be little more than a generic brawler it you stripped it of its cel-shaded imagery from Albion.     Still, that simplicity might have worked for Fable Heroes had it remained with the visuals, but it also extends to the combat. There's some variation among the available characters in that each one has a ranged or melee specialization--some, such as the unlockable Sir Walter, have both--but a lack of combos ensures that combat itself never grows much more complex than unleashing charged attacks or rolling out of harm's way.     Beyond that, characters can unleash devastating special attacks, but only at the expense of one of the five hearts that make up your health bar. Lose all of them, and you die, but that simply means that your resulting ghost loses the ability to pick up coins while fighting until you come back to life by finding another heart along the path. Until then, you're as powerful as you were before you died aside from the absence of your special attack. That power extends even to the boss fights (which unfailingly feature a hulking monstrosity that jumps around and periodically spawns minions), with the upshot that there's technically no way to lose to them.        Indeed, it's easy to get the impression that Fable Heroes isn't really about beating enemies, but rather about collecting coins. Coins fall like Louisiana rain in Fable Heroes, whether from the enemies themselves or from the crates you find littered throughout this raggedy vision of Albion. Smash enough enemies, and you get a multiplier bonus to pick up yet more coins, or you could simply beat them out of stationary targets that pop up during ""break times"" like the cars in Street Fighter II's bonus levels.      The lightweight death mechanic only intensifies the mad dash for coins. Since dying has almost no effect on your rag doll's performance in combat, sneaky players can keep all the coins for themselves by nabbing the hearts before their ghostly friends can get to them. What's more, the bland level design only gets interesting in the playable credits that allow you to fight against the names of the developers. Otherwise, each level plays much like the others, culminating in a choice of fighting the level's boss or playing minigames featuring options such as quick-time event boat races or chicken-kicking contests. In the end, the choice always comes down to deciding which one will net you the most coins.        The coins themselves come into play in a board game at the end of each level, in which each of the four players tosses dice for the chance of landing on a space that grants them one of 39 specific damage bonuses or cosmetic treats such as unlockable characters. This board game is entirely based on chance, though, which means you could end up spending your hard-won coins on nothing more than new skins for your weapon instead of a damage boost aimed at the hobbes lurking in most levels.      The randomness also makes unlocking an inner ring of the board with even better upgrades all but impossible. Early on, you even lose your rolls if you happen to land on spaces pertaining to boosts for zones you haven't visited yet. And don't expect to gain some new skills; Fable Heroes' board game only grants improvements to your existing abilities. The result is that Fable Heroes feels much the same at the end as it did at the beginning, with the only important changes affecting how much damage you deal or take.     But there's no mistaking that Fable Heroes has a certain charm, and there's enough depth for a one-shot party game with four friends or for parents seeking quality time with kids in the Family mode. Each level features power-ups that provide everything from useful speed buffs to balloons you can hold while dealing death, and the good or evil choices from Fable proper make a cameo in the form of chests that might shower coins on a random player or send lightning bolts at another, giving other players a chance to scramble for the victim's coins. There's even some pleasure in exploring bowdlerized locales such as Bowerstone, which reaches a pitch once you beat the game and unlock the ""dark"" map of Albion. Here, the deserts of Aurora become shady timberlands, and the bucolic Millfields and distant Bowerstone burn during an invasion.        If that twisted vision of Albion sounds at all enticing, it will take you only two or so hours to reach it. Fable Heroes is a short game even by the standards of most downloadable titles; its length is prolonged only by Dark Albion and the endless replays needed to get all the abilities on the board game. Thrifty-minded players might enjoy an option to send accumulated gold to their character in the upcoming Fable: The Journey, but coins drop so easily in Fable Heroes that you'll likely have enough to hire someone else to take your journey after one playthrough.      Lionhead's new creation might be the most accessible game in a series already known for its accessibility, but in its desire to distance itself from the fart jokes and bawdy flings of the numbered games, it manages to lose much of its identity--an identity that always sustained the series even in its weakest hours. Even the series' fabled assertions of ""innovation"" find no home here, and while it might be fashionable to smirk at Peter Molyneux's overambitious use of the term, the great tragedy of Fable Heroes is that it doesn't even try.    "
399,Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin,8.0,2,"The farming/life-sim genre is an increasingly crowded field these days. There is no shortage of games that offer the experience of building a small farm, raising crops and livestock, and making friends and relationships along the way. But every so often, a game in this genre comes along that really turns things on their head, taking well-worn tropes and expectations and making them feel fresh and new. Sakuna: of Rice and Ruin is such a game. It combines an in-depth rice-farming simulation with excellent 2D platforming action and a wonderful atmosphere to make a delightful, fulfilling experience.Sakuna is a haughty, bratty harvest goddess of the old-timey Japan-inspired world of Yanato. She lives comfortably with her divine peers in the Lofty Realm away from the suffering of mortals below. When a group of hungry mortals stumble into the Lofty Realm looking for food on her watch, she discovers to her horror that they've destroyed the offering to the great deity Lady Kamuhitsuki. As punishment, she and the mortals are banished to the Isle of Demons, where she is tasked with cleansing the land of evil forces while eking out a meager subsistence living with her newfound companions. Now, the goddess Sakuna needs to get her hands dirty--and bond with the humans that have lived beneath her--in order to survive.The base gameplay of Sakuna is split into two parts: exploration and simulation. The exploration sections have you traversing 2D environments to hunt enemies, collect materials needed for combat and survival, and discover new areas for gathering. The simulation sections task Sakuna with managing the day-to-day labor involved in harvesting a rice crop needed to sustain a family. Engaging in both of these activities is necessary for progress, but you need to decide how to best invest your time. A day-and-night cycle means there's a constant march onwards through the quite truncated seasons, which affect many things, such as when collected materials spoil, enemies' strength, which materials can be gathered, what farmwork can be done, and so on. The need to balance activities and manage both item and time resources makes for a gameplay loop that's interesting and challenging without being too punishing. It also allows for the gradual introduction of new elements as you progress, like additional farming tools and more exploration abilities.But what makes Sakuna such a unique and memorable experience is just how well-made and in-depth its two core gameplay systems are. If you don't know the first thing about cultivating and harvesting rice, you will learn a lot about just how intricate and labor-intensive the process is simply from playing Sakuna. Everything about the rice-farming process is detailed and represented in gameplay, starting from tilling the soil to finding ideal kernels, moving on to planting seedlings, managing water levels, pest control, and weeding, to the eventual harvest, threshing, and hulling, all of which Sakuna is directly involved with (and yes, you'll have to make fertilizer the old-fashioned way, so prepare for lots of poop-scooping and waste compounding). It's an accurate representation of the entire process and really hammers home the amount of work it takes to make a quality rice crop. And you will want to make quality crops, because the quality of the rice harvest directly impacts Sakuna's level and stats--plus, additional food eaten during meals gives her beneficial boons during exploration.The exploration sequences are also superbly done. Sakuna can run, jump, and use her Divine Raiment to grapple onto surfaces and past obstacles and enemies, deftly swinging around the screen to reach gathering and mining spots and hidden treasure chests filled with rare artifacts and soil additives. As you progress, these areas introduce new and interesting obstacles, like wind storms, jagged spikes, rolling rocks, and floating water platforms that require you to use your platforming skills to the fullest to reach hidden nooks and crannies.But this island is a demonic stronghold teeming with enemies, so Sakuna will often have to put up a fight using her farming implements and Raiment to smack some enemies around. And when we say “smack them around,” we mean it; Sakuna's combat has a very fun physics system that lets you launch, juggle, and fling enemies around with combinations of normal, special, and Raiment attacks. For example, with a mighty swing of her plough, Sakuna can send one enemy flying into a big group of foes like a bowling ball knocking down pins. Using her Raiment she can grab a large downed enemy and smash them into a wall of spikes or flying enemies. To follow-up, she can then smack a target a few more times with basic combos before they hit the ground, hopefully eliminating them entirely.Great gameplay would be enough to warrant a recommendation, but Sakuna's visual style and overall pleasant mood gives the game a warmth and beauty that really helps it stand out from the crowd. The visuals evoke a fantasy historical Japan that is filled with awe-inspiring beauty--I would frequently find myself sitting in my rice field at night, staring up at the starry sky as the wind blew through the trees, or admiring the detail of raindrops splashing on water bubbles as I went to explore in the midst of a storm. The story and characters also add greatly to Sakuna's charm, as this ragtag group of peasants-and-divine-beings grows into a close family that helps each other out. Listening to dinner conversations where foreign missionary woman Myrthe describes her hardships as a trial from God, or Tauemon describing his upbringing and misadventures adds a lot of life and connection to these characters.That isn't to say that Sakuna is flawless, however. As in any game where you have separate, very distinct gameplay styles, finding a balance between them can be tough at times, and Sakuna doesn't always succeed in that regard. There will be times when a bunch of new areas open up that you want to explore, but you're restricted by the necessity to tend to the farm's needs at a particular season. Likewise, there will be times like mid-winter when there's not much to do on the farm, which is a more ideal time for exploration--though because gathering items change with seasons, what you get from exploring in winter might not be what you want for your farming and tool-making endeavors. And sometimes you just have to wait for things to happen on the farm while there isn't anything particularly interesting going on in exploration, either--perhaps you're stymied on a tough area you want to get a stat boost to help clear--and you just have to replay old areas and kill time gathering random stuff until the harvest comes due. The worst is when the clock creeps up on you; enemies gain a massive strength boost at night, so seeing the sun set just as you're on the cusp of clearing a stage mission or reaching the exit can be a massive bummer, as can having half your spoils get spoiled.Even if it's a little rough around the edges, Sakuna is a genuine gem. Its rewarding and engaging sim gameplay, exciting freeform combat, and just the way it feels like a warm and comforting experience while you play it are what makes it one of the best life-sim style games to release in quite some time. Whether you're big into action, simulation, or both, Sakuna's journey of redemption is one well worth taking."
318,Pokemon UNITE,7.0,2,"For the Pokemon brand's first foray into a new genre, Pokemon Unite gets a lot of things right. The game certainly feels like a MOBA a la League of Legends or Dota 2, just in a much easier to understand presentation for those who've never played one before. Matches are short, snappy affairs with plenty of action and strategy. Learning each of the five classes is fun and rewarding. Each skirmish within a match ups the ante, increasing tension and excitement until it boils over in the final stretch. It's just a shame that the confusing in-game economy composed of multiple currencies and a loot box-style lottery system can sometimes get in the way of the game's fun.For those unaware, Pokemon Unite is a ""multiplayer online battle arena game"" or ""MOBA."" Two teams of up to five players choose a Pokemon, then enter an arena where they defeat wild Pokemon in the environment to gather energy and experience. Experience levels up a Pokemon, increasing its stats and powering up its moves, while energy is used to score points and win the game. This is where Pokemon Unite separates itself from traditional MOBAs. Pokemon must take their stored energy to an opposing team's goal and ""dunk"" it through the hoop to score points equal to how much energy the Pokemon held. The dunking sequence itself is wonderful, with the Pokemon slamming the energy down through the hoop with force and excitement that will put a smile on your face. Dunks aren't the only scoring method though, as special wild Pokemon sometimes appear that give temporary buffs or extra points, but they are rare and sometimes one-time occurrences during a match. When time runs out--10 minutes in a standard match--whoever has the most points wins.This goal-scoring approach is different from established MOBA games--League of Legends, for example, requires that a team enter the enemy's base and destroy the Nexus--but it's a fantastic choice in action. Most of the wild Pokemon lining the arena aren't difficult to defeat, so even novice players will be able to gather energy easily. Some goals can only have so many points scored on them before they break, meaning disabled goals force you to progress further into the opponent's side of the arena to find a new one. It's a fun spin on the core objective of a MOBA match, taking something like defeating towers in LoL in order to progress and making it unique. Also, since the goals don't fight back like LoL towers do, new MOBA players won't need to worry about extra threats when trying to score.Pokemon Unite serves as a tremendous entry point into what may be a new genre for many playersPokemon Unite does a great job of making each match feel exciting. As this is a team game, you'll feel a quick bond with teammates who stick to their roles and support as needed, and you'll feel embarrassed for the one player doing their own thing and getting crushed for it. Every mid-match skirmish where you and your teammates are meeting a group of opponents is tense and exciting, and emerging victorious is thrilling. That 10 minute timer feels like it breezes by due to how much fun each match can be.The 20 Pokemon on the Pokemon Unite roster fall into one of five categories: Attacker, All-Rounder, Speedster, Defender, and Supporter. These categories describe how each one should be controlled, leaning into the genre's strategic elements. Attackers are better suited for the frontlines, taking out enemies and scoring loads of points, while Defenders keep the team's goals safe from attack, for example. It's simple, it's straightforward, and it's exactly what a MOBA for genre newcomers should be. You'll know exactly what style of match to play depending on the Pokemon you choose, which for a brand-new MOBA player is a huge comfort. That's not to say things don't change mid-match, but taking that uncertainty out of the character-select screen lowers the barrier of entry, which is better for everyone.Team balance is a big factor in a MOBA player's success, and the game does a good job of allowing players to balance their teams how they wish. Small hints on the character select screen will let the team know which roles are not yet filled, while chosen Pokemon are faded out to clearly show who's still available. Experimentation is encouraged in Pokemon Unite matches, allowing you to tinker with team composition until finding what works for your group. This freedom makes the game even more fun, delivering a unique experience in every match.Despite having different classes, all Pokemon are controlled with the same simple button scheme. As you gain experience, the Pokemon's special attacks will power up, first changing to a new move and then adding an enhanced version. While that sounds like a lot, the game does a great job of making everything clear in real time. Pikachu, for example, starts with Thundershock as a special attack, but at a certain level it will change to either Electro Ball or Thunder with a single press of a button. You don't have to sort through menus or take minutes to power up--one simple press and you have a new move. It's yet another lowering of the entry barrier for new MOBA players, and it's well appreciated.That touches on the best part about Pokemon Unite; it serves as a tremendous entry point into what may be a new genre for many players. It's easy to pick up and play, giving everyone a chance to learn what MOBAs are all about. That said, genre veterans may find the game a little too simplistic, lacking the deep gameplay and strategic elements of LoL or Dota 2. There are no minions running around to farm for experience, and every player must head into the wild area--or ""jungle"" in MOBA speak--in order to level up. Pokemon Unite feels more of a stepping stone to other MOBA games and not the other way around, meaning longtime MOBA fans might feel underwhelmed with what they find.The speed of the matches coupled with the approachable mechanics makes grinding for higher levels easy without feeling repetitive. Grinding has its benefits, too, with Trainer Levels that give you access to new modes and rewards and an optional Battle Pass that gives even more reward drops. There are ways around grinding as well if you want to speed things up, but unfortunately that means you have to deal with microtransactions, the Achilles' heel of Pokemon Unite. The game's easy, streamlined processes in gameplay goes out the window when the game's economy enters the discussion.There are five different in-game currencies, four of which are earned by playing. Aeos Coins are the most prominent currency and are earned after every match (as well as given as rewards for daily events, Trainer Level up rewards, and more). Aeos Tickets purchase items and enhancers and are earned from events as well. There's also Fashion and Holowear Tickets--used to obtain Trainer skins and Pokemon skins respectively--that only come from the loot box-esque random draw called the Energy Reward system. The lone premium currency are Aeos Gems, which are only available via real money and can be used to purchase some of the things the other free currencies can buy, like Unite Licenses to access playable Pokemon or boosts to Battle Points to gain levels faster.Having five currencies is an unnecessarily confusing system. Granted, four of them are earned by playing the game, meaning that everything available can technically be earned by grinding out matches, but the rates at which some currencies are earned are unreasonably low. Take the Holowear Tickets for example, which are earned one of two ways: complete the 90-level Battle Pass and earn a Battle Pass Prize Box, or get a lucky break in the Energy Reward lottery system. A chance in the Energy Reward system is given every five matches, but even then the chance of pulling the Holowear Tickets is very low. Then again, should you be lucky enough to pull the Holowear Tickets, you'll only get 10, and currently the cheapest Pokemon skin available via Holowear Tickets costs 18 tickets. The quickest way to increase your chances is to buy extra Energy Reward lottery chances in the Shops--and those are only available for premium Aeos Gems.This paid currency would not be inherently bad if it were only used for cosmetic items such as those skins. As long as the game lets you earn the important things--Pokemon, battle items, etc.--by playing the game with no financial influence, the premium Aeos Gems would be a harmless addition to be ignored. Unfortunately, that's simply not the case, as Gems can also be used to purchase Unite Licenses to unlock Pokemon and temporary boosts for Aeos Coins and Battle Pass Points, allowing you to more quickly unlock items that can be used in battle.While buying a Unite License for a Pokemon just gives a player access to that Pokemon early--which isn't a big deal outside of being able to use a Pokemon in battle sooner--it's the items that are a key example of why this economy can feel unbalanced. In the Shops are two types of items: Held Items, which give your Pokemon permanent boosts in a match; and Battle Items, which are activated with a button press and give a quick temporary perk like healed damage or increased attack power. Pokemon can have up to three Held Items and one Battle Item assigned at a time. These items must be purchased in the stores before they can be equipped onto a Pokemon.What's not enjoyable is the game's economy, a confusing mess of multiple currencies and systemsBy pumping money into the game via the premium currency, either to boost Coin gain or using the Gems to purchase the items directly, a player can purchase and use these items faster than someone who's not buying Gems. Items are also included in the Battle Pass, so buying Battle Pass Point boosts with real money will unlock those items faster as well. What's more, these items can also be leveled up with Item Enhancers, yet another currency earned in-game that can be boosted with premium currency, increasing the disparity gap even further. All of this leads to a scenario where players who don't want to spend money may find themselves itemless against a team of fully decked out opponents, putting the player that hasn't purchased currency at an immediate disadvantage. Don't get me wrong: Pokemon Unite is an enjoyable game. The MOBA genre fits the Pokemon franchise very well, and as more Pokemon are introduced, the metagame will likely continue to evolve and may introduce more fun opportunities to strategize. Dropping into battle with new builds and trying new things is fun, as is taking a newly earned Pokemon into a battle and seeing what they can do. What's not enjoyable is the game's economy, a confusing mess of multiple currencies and systems designed to make paying for premium currency look like the easiest option to succeed. If microtransactions weren't so incentivized we'd be looking at the next major Pokemon success story. Knowing that they are, however, player--and considering this is Pokemon, parent of player--beware."
446,Crusader Kings III,8.0,2,"On June 14, 1073 AD, my steward, vassal and knight, Earl Muiredach mac Carthach of Desmond arrived at the meeting of my small council dressed only in, well... his birthday suit. This was the man I'd entrusted to manage the paperwork of my realm, to ensure taxes were being collected. Was this newfound fashion choice a portent of his impending madness? Was it some bold power move designed to put me off my game? A sign of the contempt in which he held his ruler? Or was it a bug, a highly specific graphical glitch that just happened to leave one of my councillors undressed? I didn't know.Perhaps it's a credit to Crusader Kings 3 that I didn't have an immediate answer, a sign of the depth and complexity of its simulation and its capacity for surprise. Perhaps it was also a failing, a breakdown somewhere between the calculations of a mass of colliding gameplay systems and how their results were communicated to me. Perhaps it's both. Regardless, this memorable event served only to highlight the singular vision of Crusader Kings 3, a grand strategy game that successfully operates across a bewildering scale, feeling vast and unknowable one moment yet awkwardly intimate the next. It's a marvel of connectivity, effectively linking together complementary elements plucked from different genres--the role-playing game, the visual novel, the life simulation, the city-builder, the wargame--even if at times you can sense it straining at the seams.You play as a single person during the Middle Ages, whether the ruler of a minor county or the sovereign of an entire empire. As the months and years pass, you choose how to tend to your realm, consolidating your holdings with new infrastructure, forging alliances through marriage, and pressing your claims--both legitimate and fabricated--to lands occupied by others. The resources at your disposal reflect your status. Gold is just as likely to be used to grease a palm as it is to pay for the construction of a barracks. Prestige, piety and renown are the real currencies of the realm. The decisions facing you are those of a politician, not a town planner or army commander.Yet as powerful as you are, you are not omnipotent. Your vassals harbour their own ambitions and will pursue their own agendas, while neighbouring rulers will have to be dissuaded with either military might or a smooth tongue from expanding into your territory. Everything is personal. Literally every single person, from the highest ruler to the most lowborn, has an opinion of you, and the likelihood of success for whatever friendly or nefarious scheme you're working is coloured by these opinions--plus a roll of the dice. Your ability to influence all those with whom you interact will shape not just individual relationships but the destiny of entire empires.Ultimately, what you do with this power and influence is an open-ended debate. There is no objective, no victory condition, no win state. At least, the game itself doesn't set you any sort of end goal. It's all left up to you. You assume the life of a particular person--a tribal chieftain on the Eurasian Steppe, a Danish countess, a sultan from Basra, a Nubian king, the Queen of Ireland, to name but five of the potential thousands--and you're free to set your own aims and motivations. When that person dies, you can carry on playing as their heir, assuming you left one.As the heir, you'll inherit any titles you're due, though depending on the succession laws of the realm, you may well find yourself fighting off envious siblings. Dynastic legacies will be passed down from one generation to the next, and the education a child receives will affect their skills and personality traits, but in terms of your new playable character's abilities and outlook, the slate is essentially wiped clean. You've got a whole new life to lead and, with any luck, five or six decades to enjoy it.Such a loose structure can feel liberating. It relieves the pressure to min/max in order to find the optimal path to win. Instead, you're able to focus on learning how the game works, how its systems interact, and which parts you find yourself wanting to explore. I found myself more willing than usual to roll with failures and not get hung up on wondering if I was doing things efficiently. In one campaign I decided my character's ambition was to rule all of Ireland. To start I held only a couple of counties in the south, but within a few decades I'd flexed my military muscle to lay claim to over half the land. Upon my character's death, I decided his ambition would pass on to his daughter. She would go on to be crowned High Queen of the Kingdom of Ireland by the age of 30. The game hadn't defined this objective for me, but it felt like the natural conclusion to this campaign of my own making.Crusader Kings 3 expects you will eventually come to a conclusion like this, put the effort into working towards it, and not just sit back and rely on being spoonfed directions. Yet for all the opportunity it affords, this lackadaisical approach can also feel discouraging. It's all too easy to find yourself struggling for motivation or simply feeling a bit lost as to what to do. Several campaigns of mine were abandoned through ennui. I just wasn't ""feeling it,"" you know? And the game just doesn't offer much encouragement in easing you back in or incentivising you to take certain courses of action. It'll present tutorial prompts now and again to remind you that you could, for example, declare war on the Norwegians right now, but it's not particularly helpful when it comes to why you would want to or if it would be a good idea.The moments I did click with the campaign was when some situation arose or event occurred that connected me on an emotional level with the character I was playing. That's because, at heart, Crusader Kings 3 is less a strategy game and more a story-telling engine inserted into a grand strategy chassis. Almost everything you do is driven by some sort of narrative event. Start a scheme to win the favour of a powerful vassal you suspect of plotting against you and it'll play out over a series of scenarios, each asking you to pick a course of action based on your character's skills. Sometimes these choices carry greater risk: opting for a dull conversation gambit when trying to seduce someone over dinner is a small setback compared to the dangers of picking a loose-lipped accomplice in a murder plot. Alone, these narrative events don't carry much weight. Indeed, you'll quickly see them repeat, even within the same campaign. What makes them effective, though, is in the gradual accumulation of them over a lifetime, and the consequences you can perceive rippling out from the choices you made. It's here in these tales you come to appreciate the expansive scope of Crusader Kings 3 and the capacity of its simulation to deliver (when it all comes together) memorable feats of procedural storytelling.In one example, my character had just unlocked a perk that improved his ability to romance another person. He was already married, happily and faithfully so, and I didn't want to risk that. The obvious thing to do was to get him to pursue the Romance scheme against his wife. It went better than I expected. He wrote her a poem, which she just adored. He got down on his knees and sang to her in front of the court, which she loved even if it was a bit embarrassing. It culminated in a breathless tryst atop a tower one night after which they were declared soulmates--a thing I hadn't been aware was even possible. This couple, both now in their 40s, had managed to reignite their passion for each other in the sweetest, dorkiest possible way. I couldn't have been happier myself in seeing that play out.A month later she was pregnant. Eight months after that, she gives birth. I see the usual window pop up describing the delivery, there's some descriptive text and the standard options to help choose a name for the newborn child. Something's different, though. I notice there are TWO new character portraits instead of one. It takes me a moment. She's given birth to twins. This is a goddamn miracle. Then I notice something else is different. My wife doesn't look herself. She's grimacing, as if she's in pain. My heart sinks as I look back to the descriptive text and finally read what happened. She died during labour.I stop playing. The blow is just devastating. Emotionally, I'm done. I get up from my desk and leave the apartment. I just have to get away, suck in some fresh air, and keep it together.Reflecting on my time with Crusader Kings 3, I'm struck by the breadth of experiences it offers. My journey took in such a range of emotions that trying to pin down a particular perspective seems futile. I've chuckled in bemusement at the absurd naked man in my court. I've felt the enduring familial pride as a daughter fulfilled her deceased father's lifelong ambition. I've been bored just half-heartedly watching the years tick by, uninspired to intervene. And I've suffered absolute heartbreak, a gutpunch as potent as any game has delivered.In a sense, Crusader Kings 3 is all over the place. It doesn't always work perfectly, and at times it really makes you work for it, but there's something amazing in that any of it works at all. Strategy games can tell interesting stories as their empires rise and fall, but their procedural narratives are rarely as affecting and poignant as they are here."
1876,Shadowgate,7.0,2,"Shadowgate name is probably familiar to you. Since it helped spark the adventure game genre back in the 80s, Shadowgate has been ported to a variety of systems, most famously the NES. You used a lot of the same commands as in a text adventure like Zork--""go"" here, ""take"" that, ""eat""--but a graphical representation of each room helped you navigate and solve puzzles. This new Shadowgate, a reimagining of the original, operates in more or less the same way. But while it's the same quest in spirit, much has been changed, added, and improved in order to make this a throwback adventure worth exploring whether you have nostalgia for it or not--provided you're ready to do a lot of pointing and clicking. Shadowgate drops you in front of a locked door with nothing but a dagger, a torch, and your wits. An optional tutorial walks you through the first few simple puzzles, but for the most part, you are on your own. The perspective is first-person, and all exploring is done by moving between mostly-static (though wonderfully illustrated) images, or rooms. Each room has its own objects of interest, which you interact with via a variety of verbs like ""hit,"" ""look"" or ""open."" Time only moves with each of your actions, leaving you free to stop and stare at the scenery as much as you'd like. You must keep a close eye on your torch and replace it if the light starts to go out, but Shadowgate is a largely slow-paced affair. If you get stuck trying to figure out a specific mechanism or wondering what item might be useful in a situation, you can get a hint from your sole traveling companion, a skull named Yorick. This is good, because there's so much to look at and interact with that it can be overwhelming. Yes, you can use your torch to burn a rug and find two gold coins underneath it. Will you need them? No. On one hand, such unnecessary interactions are great, as they give you a better sense of freedom than many point-and-click adventures, which usually limit your interactions to a few key objects. On the other hand, it means your inventory can get cluttered, which is a pain if you prefer to brute force your way through puzzles by using every object on every other object, just in case. If you find yourself using certain items or commands more than others, you can bind them to the number keys on your keyboard. This is one of several ways the developers have streamlined the experience; thanks to another tweak, a double click will usually look at an item or move in a direction, depending on what's clicked. (This doesn't always work, though. Don't hesitate to try the ""go"" command if you think you should be able to move somewhere.) Nevertheless, there is still tedium to struggle with. There is no overall quick-travel system, for instance (aside from a few shortcuts), so if you need to go from one side of the world to the other, you must make the long walk screen by screen, click by click. There is also some degree of pixel hunting, as it can be easy to overlook an item that you might need in the future. Time only moves with each of your actions, leaving you free to stop and stare at the scenery as much as you'd like. Unfortunately, Shadowgate also still suffers from the age-old problem that plagues most adventure games: puzzle solutions typically need to be very specific, and they aren't always intuitive. To be fair, this game is far better than its predecessor on that front, as most puzzles make logical sense and can be solved with wits alone. And even if you're wrong but on the right track, the game will try to nudge you in the right direction; for instance, if you try to use a dagger, the game might advise you to try something bigger (like a sword). For the most part, carefully reading clues and carefully thinking about the tools are your disposal will get you where you need to go. But spending hours trying to decipher riddles doesn't make for the most welcoming experience, especially if you lack experience with the original game. Fortunately, Shadowgate does some interesting things with its difficulty settings. You can choose between three difficulties at the start of the game, and they make the quest easier or harder by actually adding or removing content from the game itself. For example, one of the very first things you see at the start of the game is a doorway with skulls forming an arch on top of it. On the game's easiest difficulty setting, this arch is missing one skull, which you have to find and place within the arch later in order to progress. On harder settings, it's missing three. Easier difficulties remove certain items, puzzles, and even entire areas. Removing content might sound counterintuitive--why choose a gameplay setting with which you don't actually get to see the entire game?--but the effect is huge. By eliminating so many steps from the journey, Shadowgate becomes a lot more approachable if you prefer a more laid back journey. There is less chance of feeling lost, less chance of feeling paralyzed by confusion. Not only do these varied difficulty levels make this an appealing adventure to all types of players, but by adding diversity to individual puzzles, they invite you to make the trek a second or third time. The only catch is that some objects and options no longer serve a purpose on lower difficulties, which can be distracting. Players on earlier difficulties will find locked doors that can never be opened, and the game's hint system will occasionally give you information for puzzles that you never encounter, making them not just irrelevant but also misleading. Death can come quickly in Shadowgate. Using the wrong item at the wrong time, being unprepared for a room, or even simply taking too many turns to explore may prove deadly. Saving often is key to avoiding frustration, though the game's automatic saves might rescue you as well (something they're more likely to do on easier difficulty settings). There are so many ways to die, in fact, that the developers have in a sense created an entire metagame around finding Shadowgate's special ""hidden deaths,"" which are ways to die that are slightly more outside the box. For the most part, carefully reading clues and carefully thinking about the tools are your disposal will get you where you need to go. One death condition has the potential to be more annoying than the others, if you succumb to it. Relatively early on in the game, an enemy poisons you, an event that you cannot avoid. The game hints that you should take care of this sickness, but isn't specific about how long you have. Every turn you take after that point, a timer counts down to your death. Should you waste too much time trying to solve the mysteries of the castle, you could end up locking yourself into a no-win scenario. Adventure games have enjoyed a resurgence in recent years, but Shadowgate represents a different and currently rare kind of experience. It's unashamed of its roots, sometimes to a fault, but as an attempt to recreate a classic it succeeds far more than it falters. It doesn't do anything that would make the Shadowgate name as revolutionary as it once was, but it's an enjoyable adventure for old admirers and newcomers alike.  "
512,Valorant,7.0,2,"Think Counter-Strike with hero elements. That's the elevator pitch for Valorant, Riot Games' debut on the competitive first-person shooter scene. I say that not to disparage Valorant, though. In fact, that's what I love most about it, especially since it executes on the formula extremely well. Valorant thrives because of tight, tactical gameplay and a mix of character-based abilities that provide a necessary strategic layer. Although it's a slim package with limited features and barren presentation, Valorant has the potential to be great.The core mode of Valorant revolves around five-on-five matches in a best of 25 rounds with two teams of attackers and defenders of bomb sites, switching sides about halfway through. The stakes are high as everyone gets only one life per round, and the focus on precise gunplay with low time-to-kill leaves little margin for error. Teams must account for buying guns, armor, and ability charges based on money allocated (depending on performance) on a per-round basis. In turn, each round maintains a high level of intensity as the tide of advantage can shift at any moment.Agents introduce an essential X-factor to the mix with their unique abilities as well. While it's easy to compare them to heroes/classes from other games, Valorant's Agent abilities function more like gear in a loadout. Two are subject to limited uses per round (but thankfully carry over even if you're killed) while a default ability subject to cooldown or replenish upon kills. Knowing how and when to execute these abilities, including Ultimates that can come in clutch, is key especially for highly competitive matches.I love playing as Raze, an offensive Agent who wields a variety of powerful explosives and a devastating rocket launch as an Ultimate. Another personal favorite, Jett, has the gift of mobility that can either throw off opponents, get better vision of the action, or simply charge the enemy aggressively. As Sage, the revive Ultimate can be a game-changer, while her ice barrier can cut off dangerous sightlines at key moments. And her healing spell could just be the difference in whether or not a teammate comes out alive in a firefight.It'd be tough to break down the abilities of all 11 agents, but their purposes are easy to parse through the four different roles. Each Agent has the capacity to be effective without feeling like a chore to play. Understanding their use cases will put you in a better position to win, even more so when used in conjunction with teammates. For a common example, Sova's motion sensor arrows can easily set up an aggressive push and create an opportunity to get the most out of an offensive Agent's Ultimate. Familiarity with all these mechanics will also inform you on how to react when you see your opponent using similar tactics--it all seems well-balanced at this point.Valorant's dynamics are enough to sustain it as a competitive shooter worth investing time into because winning itself is an intrinsic reward built on the merits of strong gameplay.Now, this isn't your typical shooter. Every gun has a specific recoil pattern you'll need to understand before being able to handle them properly. And you'll need to get in the habit of effectively peeking around corners as you move into firefights and holding specific sightlines to anticipate enemy activity. There's a distinct, tempered pace to how it's played, further emphasized by the importance of sound. Footsteps, gunfire, and abilities going off will tip you on enemy positions and strategies. This is all to say that Valorant maintains a certain calculated design that ushers in the fun mental aspect you'd expect from a good tactical shooter.Valorant's dynamics are enough to sustain it as a competitive shooter worth investing time into because winning itself is an intrinsic reward built on the merits of strong gameplay. The time-tested demolition mode remains an enticing context for thrilling FPS moments because of how much it stresses skill and strategy, just like Counter-Strike or Rainbow Six Siege.However, it cuts both ways as the experience can sometimes devolve into frustration. It's not necessarily Valorant's fault; rather, it's inherent to this style of game. Being stuck with a poorly coordinated team will make these long-winded matches feel like a drag. You'll be understandably punished for leaving, and the team will proceed with one less player who won't be backfilled, compounding the disadvantage. It's one area we expect the Valorant experience to improve with ranked matchmaking. Squadding up with friends mitigates the problem, of course, and at least in my experience, random teammates have been willing to work together and coordinate more often than not.But outside of the standard demolition-style mode and the modified Spike Rush, it's quite barebones.Full matches are a considerable time investment, but there's a bite-sized mode called Spike Rush. It's a best-of-seven that runs about 10 minutes, so you can get your fill without the long-term commitment. The buy phase is dropped in favor of randomized loadouts, all attackers carry bombs, and Agent abilities are charged at the start of the round. Power-ups are scattered on the map to play it up as an arcade-style mode. It'd be nice to have other variations on this mode since Spike Rush negates some core strategic elements and feels a bit too short for the time it takes to get started, but it offers a welcome change of pace when you want it.Currently, Valorant features four maps to play at random. They're designed with balance and symmetry in mind, so they make for proper competitive battlegrounds. Some have key map features like Haven's third bomb site and Bind's cross-map teleporters that accelerate site rotations. But otherwise, each map feels quite similar; flat in detail and sterile in its aesthetic.A lot of this sentiment can be attributed to Valorant's bland art style. I understand it's meant to be a low-spec game that can run on old hardware, and the visuals make it easy to distinguish what's happening on screen. Given Riot's emphasis on esports, the direction of prioritizing function over flash makes sense. But it doesn't negate the fact that Valorant isn't particularly exciting to look at whether spectator or player.As for progression, you'll earn XP through completing matches and daily goals. Then you have Contracts tied to specific Agents, which are essentially progression tracks that your XP gets applied toward; these will unlock an assortment of cosmetics. You start with five Agents in the base roster, and can unlock the rest through earning enough XP or paying for them. Since I used a reviewer's account, several gun skins and 10,000 VP (premium currency) were included to unlock all Agents. However, gun skins can be pretty expensive. As an example, you can spend $50 USD to get 5,350 VP, yet the Prime Collection that includes five weapon skins goes for 7,100 VP. At least there's no pay-to-win or loot box elements here, and it's worth keeping in mind that Valorant is a free-to-play game at the end of the day.Overall, Valorant has a strong foundation in its gameplay, and of course, that's the most significant part for an FPS of this style to succeed. Although it doesn't break new ground, the dynamic of sharp gunplay and Agent abilities would make Counter-Strike and Overwatch proud. Valorant easily captures the competitive highs of a good, intense match at the risk of pigeonholing you in a bad one. But outside of the standard demolition-style mode and the modified Spike Rush, it's quite barebones. It is important to note that these types of games are always evolving. Regardless, Valorant's in a good state--it's not great, but it certainly can be."
1279,Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse,9.0,2,"Nanashi and Asahi might not be related by blood, but they’ve formed a familial bond as two young would-be Hunters in post-apocalyptic Tokyo. Hunters help the populace by battling and taming demonic hordes that exist above ground in the city’s now-eternal night. They also serve as a lifeline for humanity, helping people forage and survive in the midst of a supernatural conflict between the hellish forces of Lucifer and the almighty angels of Merkabah.Since Apocalypse’s story runs concurrent to Shin Megami Tensei IV’s Neutral Path storyline, folks who have played the original will see events and characters from a different perspective--that of the people living in what remains of Tokyo. While it helps to have some familiarity with the original, the game’s starting events ramp up so quickly that you're immediately engaged with the story at hand. While Shin Megami Tensei IV makes you slog through the dull-as-dirt setting of Mikado before you get to see the far more interesting demonic Tokyo, Apocalypse puts you right in the middle of the perpetually dark megacity, where all the interesting events and plot development take place.Apocalypse’s amazing sense of visual design manages to create a terrifying-yet-beautiful vision of a ruined metropolis. You explore fallen structures and landmarks, forage through rotten train stations, high-end shopping centers, and parks to find scraps of the old world to pawn for cash. The demons that roam and attack passersby are a mix of iconic Shin Megami Tensei designs and all-new art, some of which is particularly awe-inspiring--you know you're in trouble when you encounter a giant, makeup-smeared donkey-headed creature with a ripped torso and a peacock tail.Beyond the story and setting, however, Apocalypse makes a host of improvements to its core gameplay that immensely improves the experience of demon hunting and exploration--save for the map, which is still as difficult to discern as it was in Shin Megami Tensei IV. For starters, the simple act of receiving new quests is now mostly automated. Instead of having to report back to a hub, quests are automatically delivered to Nanashi’s cell phone, and registered as complete when he accomplishes their goal; an elegant way to streamline the questing process. In addition, all of the game’s difficulty settings are unlocked from the get-go, and you can freely switch between them instead of forcing your way through a demoralizing cycle of deaths to access the easy difficulty setting.Beyond the story and setting, however, Apocalypse makes a host of improvements to its core gameplay that immensely improves the experience of demon hunting and exploration--save for the map, which is still as difficult to discern as it was in Shin Megami Tensei IV.Demon recruiting and fusion, a crucial component to the core Shin Megami Tensei games, also sees an interesting overhaul. Certain demon types that were once impossible to recruit through normal means can now be invited to join via the in-battle Scout command, and they have new conversation trees to explore. There’s also a brand-new element introduced where demons receive additional, innate buffs or debuffs to particular skill types, which needs to be taken into account when fusing demons to create new variations. For example, a primarily magic-damage-focused demon may have innate penalties on physical skills, but they get a bonus damage or MP reduction effect on electric and healing techniques. This is something you need to take into consideration when picking which skills to pass on to demons that result from fusions. Sure, you can make a Jack Frost with fire skills, but when it’s got an innate damage-dealt penalty on fire skills, wouldn’t that skill slot be better used for something it’s actually good at?Combat itself benefits from improvements, too. While the engine is the same turn-based Press Turn system seen across several SMT games, two additions make a big difference in Apocalypse. The first seems minor at first: an overhaul to the Smirk status. By scoring critical hits and/or hitting an opponent’s weakness, a character or demon can score an extra turn in battle and potentially trigger the Smirk status, which negates that character’s own weakness while guaranteeing a critical hit on the next turn. In Apocalypse, however, Smirk can also grant normal skills a guaranteed additional effect, such as status debuffs or instant kills. Smirk was already crucial in Shin Megami Tensei IV, but intelligent use of it in Apocalypse makes battling a lot more efficient in the long run.Everything about Apocalypse looks, feels, and sounds great; the excellent soundtrack works to enhance the feelings of exploration in a darkened, destroyed world. All of the gameplay additions improve elements where the original Shin Megami Tensei IV was lacking.The other (more visibly important) addition is the partner system. A bevy of partners join you over the course of the game, including your friend Asahi, a kid from the Yakuza, a woman with the powers of a fairy queen, and the reincarnation of SMT4's obnoxious heel, Navarre. One character can be assigned as a partner, and they’ll join you in combat, attacking and providing backup under AI control. Partners can be targeted and damaged by enemies just like a normal party member, but since they’re not on the front lines, they can’t be targeted by several skills--a reality that's both detrimental and beneficial. Each partner specializes in different skills, such as buffs, healing, or direct damage, so picking the right partner for the right battles is crucial. After they’ve fought for a certain amount of turns, your team comes together for an all-out attack, using their combined skills while teaming up to deliver big damage and cancel an enemy’s turn entirely, making them invaluable for extensive boss fights.Everything about Apocalypse looks, feels, and sounds great; the excellent soundtrack works to enhance the feelings of exploration in a darkened, destroyed world. Your demonic servants roar, cry, and yell in the heat of battle, making combat feel more lively and risky than ever before. All of the gameplay additions improve elements where the original Shin Megami Tensei IV was lacking. Meanwhile, the story’s eagerness to get into the heat of the new conflict makes it quick and easy for you to become caught up in this bewildering, dangerous world where humans, gods, and demons coexist. Apocalypse is a fantastic RPG that goes above and beyond the original Shin Megami Tensei IV to become one of the shining gems of the 3DS library."
413,Sackboy: A Big Adventure,7.0,2,"Sackboy finally has a game to call his own. The smiley mascot for LittleBigPlanet and, occasionally, the PlayStation brand has always been treated as more of an icon than a character, a cutesy tabula rasa through which all video-game-related things are possible. In Sackboy: A Big Adventure, his purview is much more traditional. He's a jumpman, a platformer in the tradition of Mario, Sonic, Crash, and all the other mascots that came before him. Sackboy, both the character and the game, rises to succeed the mascot platformer mantle well in many respects. Though its aesthetic often feels bland, its solid platforming makes for a worthy challenge.Like many platformers, story is not Sackboy's strong suit. You’re jumping around Craftverse, the world of LittleBigPlanet, to save it from a villainous jester doll called Vex. Though you'll get a fairly steady stream of updates reminding you of Vex's evil presence, there's not much you need to know. You could say the story is a waste of Sackboy's surprisingly compelling cuteness. On the other hand, you could argue that Sackboy's cuteness keeps your interest in the game afloat, even without a compelling story.Sackboy regularly evokes LittleBigPlanet's arts-and-crafts visual aesthetic. Sometimes, the motif works well. There are great visual details in many of the levels, like hard-drawn cutouts of animals in the backgrounds or platforms made from stacks of books, which imply that the levels were set up in a child's bedroom. More often, though, it leads to generic ""imagination-world"" design. Most of the enemies are multi-colored animals or blocks with cute but angry eyes. And, even with those craftsy details, the basic level settings--space, the jungle, under the sea--all feel vague.While the visual design is generally uninspired, the art itself shows off the impressive technical capabilities of the PlayStation 5. The bright and colorful levels, full of spinning platforms, lasers, and all kinds of moving parts, make for a visual feast in 4K. The movements of the gracefully weaving camera feel notably smooth. Lasers and metallic surfaces--like ruby armored crabs--shine. It may not give Craftworld a strong sense of place, but the art looks adorable.It also helps that the game has a great soundtrack to keep you moving. Each level's catchy, upbeat track feels good to jump along to. Some of them feature riffs based on pop hits and classical scores you may recognize. I rarely take a moment to stop and just listen to game music, but I frequently found myself wanting to take these tracks in, either because they were songs I recognized or because they simply had me bouncing my head along.Sackboy's core competency, platforming, is quite strong. All the moves in Sackboy's core arsenal--a jump with a secondary flutter, a punch, and a roll--all feel responsive and precise. Like the LittleBigPlanet games, Sackboy’s jump is a little floaty with a full button press, but having a flutter ability gives you more control over when and how you land. Despite its storybook appearance, Sackboy does feature sequences that present some significant challenges, particularly if you're trying to collect every item along the way. But the levels are built around Sackboy’s particular jump, and the game’s demands are based around it.Sackboy's multi-faceted levels are the real stars, though. It feels like every part of each level serves up a new challenge, which keeps things fresh. Some areas are straightforward, pushing you to string together jumps as if you're running an obstacle course. Other areas are more self-contained. In some levels, you're forced to search a larger area for a set of hidden keys to advance. Some are built around items you find at the start of each level, like a boomerang, which allows you to hit enemies and collect items from afar, or anti-gravity boots, which let you float at the height of your jump for an extended period of time. There's an incredible amount of variety within each level and from one level to the next.Not every concept level works, though. Each world has a musical level, where all the elements of the world--enemies, platforms, and background objects--move in time with pop songs like ""Uptown Funk,"" which are playing, lyrics and all. It's an interesting concept, but ultimately jarring. Different level elements move in time with different parts of the song, which made it hard to track at times. There's a moment of recognition when each level starts, which is pretty neat, but that quickly falls away. By the end, the lyrics are so distracting that it can be difficult to keep track of everything going on. Obviously, this is in stark contrast with the standard soundtrack, which is impressive with and without a pop connection.Sackboy is a hoarder's platformer. Every level is chock-full of things to pick up: score bubbles, a LittleBigPlanet holdover; collectibells, which you use to buy costumes between levels; dreamer orbs, which you need to collect to unlock the final level of each world; and costume parts. Bounding through each level, you're constantly grabbing items and scouring the levels for more. To find it all, you need to keep an eye out for alternate paths, extra spaces, and hidden rooms housing self-contained minigames and puzzles. At the end of each level, you're given a trophy based on how many score bubbles you got. (It takes a picture of your Sackboy with the trophy. It's cute.) While you can technically complete a level with very little, the expectation is that you will make an effort to find most, if not all, of it.And lowering your score is the primary form of punishment. You start each level with five lives, which you lose by getting hit by enemies or falling in pits. When you lose a life, you lose a percentage of your score bubbles, making it harder to get a high score. When you lose all your lives, you have to start the level over. Having a limited number of lives is rarely an issue--even when you die frequently, extra lives start popping up frequently from enemies and breakable items the moment you lose one. The real impact is how it affects your score.So the goal is to master each level, completing it with the highest possible score, collecting all the important items, and without losing a life. It seems fairly attainable at first, but by the halfway point in the game, Sackboy ramps up to offer a pretty significant challenge, even without the score chase. Mastering most levels should take a couple tries, and there's always room for improvement. That said, the game kindly avoids penalizing less competitive completionists; other than score bubbles, once you acquire an item, you have it for good. Even the dreamer orbs and costume pieces you've acquired before dying mid-level count as acquired.In addition to the standard levels, you can unlock short but extra challenging time trial levels that really push you to make every movement count. Even these levels feature a collectible-hunting component--most have clocks in the world that shave seconds off your time. Short and precise, these challenges feel very different from the long, winding campaign levels and give you the chance to mix things up if the standard flow ever starts to feel stale.There are also optional co-op-only Teamwork levels, which feature puzzles that require a certain amount of coordination. (In the interest of full disclosure: I'm quarantining solo, so I've only played one of these, just to get a sense of how they work. I'll say this: The puzzles are trickier when you're holding two controllers at once.) You can also play the core Sackboy campaign multiplayer via local co-op all the way through with up to four players. Everyone plays as Sackboy, but with different outfits, so you can put that wardrobe to good use. According to Sony, cross-gen online multiplayer is coming later this year. Personally, I prefer to play platformers solo, so I didn't see not having access to co-op as a real loss.Sackboy is a solid platformer and, despite its rote art style, makes great use of the PS5's enhanced visual and technical performance. It's a fun little romp of a platformer, with lots of interesting moments. At times, the visual design can look a bit flat. Even in those moments, though, the tight controls and interesting level layouts create gameplay challenges that make those flaws easy to overlook."
4476,Army Men: Sarge's Heroes,4.0,0,"The first game in 3DO's Army Men series for the console systems, Army Men 3D for the PlayStation, lacked a great deal of spit and polish but had enough going deep down to make you hope for a sequel, albeit one that was much improved. That sequel, Army Men: Sarge's Heroes, came out for the Nintendo 64 last year and has now arrived for the PlayStation, but not much, if anything, has been improved upon, and it contains even more problems. You once again take the role of Sarge, a soldier on the Green side of a world full of plastic army men. The Green are in a war against the Tan forces, who have recently begun importing terrible weapons from our own world, such as magnifying glasses, which they use to melt your men down to plastic puddles. Your mission is to gather your troops, a la John Belushi in The Blues Brothers, to create a unit capable of stopping them. Your arsenal is made up of weapons from Army Men 3D, such as a machine gun, a flamethrower, and grenades, with new additions like a sniper rifle and mines. The game camera in Army Men 3D's single-player mode was near perfect because it stuck right behind your back, but in Sarge's Heroes for the N64, it floated behind you, and when your character turned, it took a few seconds to catch up. You'd sneak around the corner of a barracks and confront an enemy, who would then fire on you immediately, only he wouldn't come into view for a few seconds. Luckily, the camera in the PlayStation version of AM:SA stays put right behind you, although it also zooms into the sky for dramatic effect at times. Another fix is that it's now very easy to strafe in the game - not having this option was one of the main complaints about the original Army Men 3D. Also, expected differences between the PlayStation and N64 versions, such as improved sound and CG movies between levels, are of course present.  You probably won't need to get close to too many troops though, since the autotargeting is set so you can pick off enemies situated in towers simply by firing in their general direction. That was in place in Army Men 3D, but you weren't really able to get away with just running around blasting opposing forces because you'd get eaten up by machine-gun fire. Now, while enemies still fall with one or two shots, your character is a lot tougher, and health-restoring power-ups can be found all over the place. One pitfall that you'll have to worry about though is that you'll stumble upon an odd patch of land where the collision detection has decided to go wonky, and while you are trying to unstick yourself, you might get mowed down by a machine gunner. This is a strange but real concern. Somehow the graphics in Army Men: Sarge's Heroes for the PlayStation have turned out worse than in the original game. Pop-up and fog are plentiful, the textures are repeated often, and the world generally looks very sparse and bland. Instances where you'll end up floating in midair or observe enemies walking through buildings are frequent. The sound effects are also similarly bad. Explosions, weapon fire, and your character's Duke Nukem-esque chatter all sound muffled, and the military-themed music is tinny. The multiplayer mode has been trimmed back to two players from the N64's four, taking any fun out of it. .  Those hoping for a more polished sequel to Army Men 3D will be disappointed to hear that this title is even more shoddily produced than the original and that it retains little of its embarrassing charm. Within minutes of playing Army Men: Sarge's Heroes, you will be surprised at what Sony will approve for final release these days."
2721,Silent Hill HD Collection,7.0,2,"Silent Hill has been reborn in Silent Hill: Shattered Memories, the next two entries in the series are up for rerelease. Silent Hill HD Collection includes Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 3, as well as Born From a Wish, the bonus chapter from Silent Hill 2 staring Maria from the game's special edition. Outside of the visuals, this collection is presented with a minimum of tweaks and additions but does a great job of bringing these two landmark horror games back for another scare.        Both games look great. The high-definition visuals let you pick up on small details, such as shop signs and the deformities of a monster's face, that were easy to miss in the original games. Fog remains prevalent but has been pushed back to reveal more of the scenery. The lighting effects have also been improved. Previously, darkness was darkness: black, oppressive, and nearly impossible to see through without the intense beam of your flashlight. Now the darkness isn't as thick, and the light sources have been softened to make everything easier on the eyes.     When you start Silent Hill 2, you can choose new or original voices. For all of the game's accomplishments, its original voice acting was awkward and flat. The new voices are a big improvement and add some much-needed emotion to a character-driven story. There's just one problem: James' breathing. When stopping after a long run, James breathes heavily. Whether by design or not, his breathing comes in harsh, metallic wheezes that make him sound like one of the game's monsters. It's a small but constantly jarring annoyance.        Silent Hill 3 doesn't include any audio annoyances, but what it does have is frame-rate lag. This typically occurs in large, open areas with lots of enemies. Everything eases into slow motion until you either kill the monsters or duck into a new area. This problem isn't exclusive to Silent Hill 3, but since Silent Hill 2 has more claustrophobic environments with fewer enemies, it doesn't occur as often in James' neck of the woods. By no measure do these performance dips render either game unplayable, but they are noticeable.     Both games play the same as they did before: James is still trying to find his dead wife, and poor Heather just wants to get home from the mall. In today's action-packed world of survival horror, going back to the slow, methodical controls of a Silent Hill game can be difficult. But in a strange way, the stiffness works to the game's benefit. Your character isn't a superhero and can be easily overwhelmed when two or more enemies attack. James and Heather get tired, miss gun shots, take slow, deliberate swings with their weapons, and reflect the capabilities of a normal person.       Silent Hill 4: The Room, released around the same time and on the same platforms as the previous two, escaped inclusion in this release. Nonetheless, Silent Hill HD Collection is a convenient way for fans to experience the series' early years on modern hardware.   Editor's note: This review originally stated you could disable trophy notifications via the PS3's system settings, which is incorrect. The review has been amended accordingly. GameSpot regrets the error. "
812,Luigi's Mansion,7.0,2,"Luigi's Mansion sees Mario's put-upon younger brother exploring a mansion after receiving a letter telling him that he won it in a contest. He arrives to find that not only is the mansion haunted and full of ghosts, but that Mario received a similar letter and has not been seen since he entered.When it released, the game represented a major shift away from the usual Mario format--there's no jump button here. Instead, Luigi has a flashlight and a ghost-sucking vacuum (the Poltergust 3000), which he needs to use to rid the mansion of ghosts and save a captured Mario in the process. You move through the mansion methodically, unlocking new rooms by vacuuming up the ghosts in the ones you've already opened.The ghosts are divided between your standard ghoulies, 'portrait' ghosts (mini-bosses and bosses, essentially, which have escaped out of paintings), and Nintendo's familiar Boos. Standard ghosts come in a few different varieties--some will grab you, others will punch, throw bombs, or hurl banana peels for you to slip on--and can be vacuumed up once you shine your flashlight at the heart visible in their ethereal chests. When you start up your vacuum, Luigi will be dragged around the room as they try to escape, and you lower their hit-points by pulling the stick away from them, as though Luigi was pulling back, while keeping the vacuum trained on them. It's a fun system, especially when you manage to nab multiple ghosts at once and have to put in the effort to reel them all in.Luigi's 'Strobulb' flashlight from Luigi's Mansion 2 has also been added. The Strobulb, which can be charged for an extra big flash of light, is useful in a few scenarios--I found that it was helpful for nabbing multiple invisible enemies at once--but the game was designed with a standard flashlight in mind, and I mostly stuck with it.Portrait ghosts are the main meat of the game and capturing them generally involves solving a small puzzle or figuring out the pattern of their movements. None of them are too complicated--you can examine each portrait ghost for a clue, and simply interacting with the objects in the room will usually trigger the ghost's 'stun' state so that you can begin to vacuum them. These are fun encounters, even if their patterns are usually easy to predict. Hunting the 50 Boos that scatter around the mansion at a certain point in the story is enjoyable for the first 40-or-so--a blinking light on the screen lets you know when you're close to one, and during a chase they can slip through walls and into other rooms--but the novelty of these pursuits wears out towards the end of the game.Once most of the mansion's doors are open and its rooms cleared are towards the end you'll have to do a lot of backtracking, which can get tedious. But it's worth tracking down every ghost--this is a short game, and you'll get more out of it if you hunt down everything. The brevity of Luigi's Mansion was a major complaint during the initial launch, and while our expectations regarding game length have shifted somewhat (six-hour games are less unusual than they were at the time) Luigi's Mansion still feels like it ends too early. While you can replay for a high score, dictated by how much treasure you find and earn, or play the more difficult 'Hidden Mansion' mode that unlocks after finishing the game, the core experience is still a tad thin. 2013's Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon was a big improvement in this regard, although there's still an allure to the original game's focus on a single location that you slowly master.The 3DS' second screen is put to great use too, now displaying a 2D map of the mansion at all times. This makes navigation much easier than it was on the GameCube, as there's no need to bring up a separate map screen, which cuts down on some late-game frustration. You now tilt the 3DS to dictate where Luigi is pointing his light or vacuum, which mostly works but can be finicky when the camera plays up in some of the game's tighter spaces. Although the game supports the C-stick on the New Nintendo 3DS, it's not viable since Luigi barely moves his torch or vacuum when using it--motion controls are essential.Despite these few tweaks and additions, Luigi's Mansion still feels like the same game it was in 2001. That means the little touches that made the game so memorable have remained. Luigi still charmingly hums the theme tune--confidently or fearfully, depending on whether the room you're in has been cleared or not--and his shaky animations are as much of a delight as ever. Luigi still carries a translucent purple 'Game Boy Horror', which can be used to scan rooms for clues. Even the hilarious interact animation that makes it look like Luigi is humping everything in the room, often paired with an enthusiastic 'oh, yeah!', is unchanged. The stranger puzzles and curious aesthetic elements that you might remember remain, and it serves as an interesting, fun look into how Nintendo managed the transition into their fourth console generation.Luigi's Mansion is the only GameCube port Nintendo has put onto the 3DS, and while some details have been noticeably toned down for the 3DS' smaller screens (the ghosts are less translucent, for example) there's nothing that feels like an unreasonable compromise. The game adapts to a lower resolution much better than many of the Wii and Wii U ports we've seen to the 3DS, giving the game the curious feel of an excellent tech demo for a system that is now on its way out.The main new feature is an offline co-op mode, which lets you play the entire game through with another player if they also have a copy of the game (or replay boss fights with anyone who owns a 3DS). The second player gets to control a version of Luigi made entirely from green goo, and can assist throughout the game by sucking up ghosts and helping to solve puzzles. This is likely to be a very niche feature--Luigi's Mansion is not an especially difficult game and playing together on your 3DS just doesn't appeal the same way a traditional console does--but it's a neat bonus. The whole game also supports 3D, and looks great with the slider turned up.The game also supports four amiibo--Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Boo--and each one will make your game permanently easier. Mario will change the poisonous mushrooms ghosts sometimes spit out into super mushrooms that restore health, Luigi gives you a chance of surviving death, and Boo will mark the location of five undiscovered Boos on the map. By far the most useful, though, is Toad--the Toads scattered around the mansion act as save points, and if you scan this amiibo they'll also restore your health. This is the one enhancement that should have been made universal--not having to shake every item in every room for hearts takes some potential tedium out of the game.Seventeen years after its first release, with one sequel out and another on its way, there's still nothing quite like Luigi's Mansion. Nintendo's strange foray into the paranormal has aged well--I was surprised at how much of it had stuck in my memory, and how good it felt being back in its haunted halls. It's a basic port with a few issues, but Luigi's Mansion still remains a charming and enjoyable game."
3472,Dragon Age: Origins,7.0,2,"         Great new music is another highlight of Dragon Age: Origins - Leliana's Song. The crooked tunes you hear during the first hour suit the gleeful malevolence of ""the game,"" and somber music enhances the emotional resonance of multiple scenes. It's nice to see the Orlesian bard get her due, though the by-the-numbers clashes and restricted party size keep this three-hour slice of downloadable content from hitting consistent high notes. But if you like the prospect of seeing the impish side of Dragon Age's most pious party member, this $7 add-on is a solid proposition.     "
261,Final Fantasy XIV Online: A Realm Reborn,8.0,2," This review features spoilers for Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker. Read at your own peril!That is a mark of a good trial.And of level 90 kits, I can only speak for Red Mage. RDM's kit in prior expansions hits the sweet spot between party utility and DPS--a job valued for Verraise but also decent damage output. And Endwalker doesn't mess with the formula. Along the way to level 90, RDM's will get Magick Barrier--a party-wide damage reduction buff that also enhances healing--and a new powerful AoE called Resolution triggered by Scorch. RDM does not get a total makeover like Summoner in Endwalker, but instead receives new spells that build on the job's strength and appeal.The final Zenos fight simultaneously reflects the best of what Endwalker has to offer, and also where it falls short. Immediately after defeating the Endsinger through the power of friendship and with Zenos' help, we find ourselves in a surprising solo combat engagement with said helper-slash-archenemy. I did not see it coming--not enough padding is established to cushion this particular landing--making it feel out of place with the prior portion's emotional arc.Was this a throwaway moment, where the writers just stuck the Zenos showdown at the end because they didn't know what to do with him? Or was this a meta nod towards the players who find the raiding and fight mechanics more of a thrill than the story, and thus here was an expansion-ending energetic battle? A generous narrative reading of course, could also contrast Zenos to Meteion--an inert, apathetic guy who rejects any and all outside influences versus a creation who is highly empathetic and absorbs despair like a sponge. And as the Warrior of Light, we need to defeat both of these entities to preserve ""balance,"" a constant FFXIV theme.But in the end, the feeling of the fight wins out over the confusing why of it. The battle with Zenos is hilariously enjoyable: Just him and me, me and him, fighting for the hell of it in the far reaches of outer space. It reminded me of when I first started FFXIV, the total joy in learning how to use a class and beating up ladybugs, rats, and butterflies. Before defeating the intergalactic villain Meteion, merciless Imperials, revenge-mad dragons, and serving justice in the name of greater causes, we were simply adventurers wandering around and testing where our sword could get us. The Zenos battle serves that initial spirit, and so while Endwalker could have threaded more Zenos moments to get us to this penultimate fight, I am satisfied.For all that Endwalker suffers from pacing issues and the sheer amount of plot lines it lobs at us, an earnestness carries the entire story. Endwalker is jubilant in its sincerity, and tender in the way it treats life and death, mankinds' inevitable failing and flaws. It doesn't shy away from grand proclamations that would come across as cheesy if it was any other game, with any other cast of characters. But because it's FFXIV and because the Scions are people who accompanied us through Ala Mhigo's revolution, averting the apocalypse on the First, and much more, Endwalker's loud and bold demands for hope, light, and love fall more on the endearing side rather than hamfisted sentimentality. Endwalker is a fitting, emotional conclusion to a years-long journey for us adventurers, and I can't wait to see what's next."
2810,Voltron,4.0,0,"     Thegame follows the titular robot through four episodes of the original 1980s television series, with each episode being split into four levels bracketed by vintage clips from the show. The plot loosely follows that of the original show and includes familiar moments (such as the climactic battle with the ""evil"" Voltron). On a superficial level, it's absolutely true to the spirit of the original series. It helps that the material is still pretty strong. The original show remains obscure in Japan because of the proliferation of super robot anime at that time, but the dub really did a great job of mixing in components that should be familiar to Americans without losing the original's distinctly Japanese flavor. As such, Voltron really managed to stand out and shine among its contemporaries, and its original charm has hardly diminished.             "
499,CrossCode,6.0,1,"It's been a long, long road for CrossCode to finally hit consoles. The 16-bit throwback RPG started life as a widely praised 2012 tech demo, enjoyed a super-funded 2015 Indiegogo campaign, and then arrived on Steam in 2018. Two years later, it's hard not to feel that all this runway has caused CrossCode to be overly ambitious and complicated--even for veteran genre players. As I was sailing into my 20th hour and still trying to not second-guess my shaky strategy for the vast amount of stats that can be customized and stacked, the game was still unspooling tutorials and rolling out new wrinkles. CrossCode is a lot of game to wrap your head around, and one whose expansive menu screens and tutorials double as a mechanically overbearing strategy guide that cannot be skimmed to even start to get your bearings. Playing CrossCode can be a bit like going on a road trip without GPS: Every few miles, you have to pull over and unfold an unwieldy road atlas.CrossCode, at its heart, is not a retro-styled hollow homage to Super Nintendo titles like 1993's Secret of Mana and 1995's Chrono Trigger. Instead, it's something more like a full-throated continuation of their tradition of exploring massive worlds full of side quests, puzzles, colorful characters, and gear to collect--while also building on their thornier, more tactical contemporaries. CrossCode's fondness for this era of action role-playing games is clear out of the gate: Both the opening menu screen and introductory sequences set the tone with plaintive piano, chiming bells, and an oozing chiptune soundtrack that wouldn't be out of place on one of those ""lofi beats to relax/study to"" YouTube playlists that lean more heavily into nostalgia. The pixel art style doubles down on all this.The above is in sharp contrast to the game taking place in a fictional, modern MMORPG called CrossWorlds. That is, CrossCode is a single-player game taking place in an in-game MMO where other characters speak and behave either as other players or NPCs. It's a world filled with guilds, griefers, and other player characters running through, too busy questing and level-grinding to hold still and talk with you. And just like in a real MMO, the other players you make your way on with will chat and open up about their lives--and give you due notice when they feel they've been playing way too long and need to log out and take a break.There's a layer to the story above and zoomed out from this, which is that your character, Lea, is not what she seems. A man named Sergey Asimov tells Lea she must play CrossWorlds to learn more about herself--and once you start playing, CrossCode's dominant note is more often meta commentary and jokes about MMOs and their players rather than making sense of the schemes and conspiracies pointing to what the hell is really going on.However true these in-game jokes and critiques ring, they unfortunately continue a legacy of games mistaking a self-awareness of tropes as license to get away with deploying them. Not that there's anything inherently wrong with tropes in themselves, but CrossCode repeatedly features characters you can overhear complaining about aspects of CrossWorld that legitimately are worth complaining about. The result isn't quite Westworld-style provocative questions on the nature of existence, but rather telegraphs a game developer who is apologetic about aspects or entire chunks of a game it fully expects people to groan through.Early on, another character will praise the game's combat but vent, ""The puzzles on the other hand… sometimes they're just a thorn in the side, don't you think? Especially in those dungeons."" It's hard to disagree. But it would be unfair to say we weren't warned: Curiously, the game's Indiegogo advertised five years ago that ""the essence of CrossCode is throwing balls at everything."" Again, it's hard to disagree.These balls come into play in combat as projectiles, but are pivotal for the many, many puzzles ahead: Well-timed and precise aim is required to throw switches, move boxes, and to hit certain things in a specific and required sequence. The dungeons further complicate this by making certain puzzle facets elemental-themed--you'll need the flame power to get through the ice dungeon, for example, but won't know this until after you've gotten stuck, hung in way longer than you thought you should across multiple levels of a dungeon, only to earn a new power you're expected to instantly have mastery over to manipulate puzzle elements.The unveiling of this elemental side to everything, while familiar to RPGs overall, can make progress halting and confusing--particularly because of how expansive CrossCode is, and how often you will find yourself fighting enemies who have an obvious element weakness but with no clue where to find the necessary weapon to make advancement more within your grasp. Before you start playing the game, a warning appears that CrossCode was ""designed with challenge in mind for both combat and puzzles,"" and, boy, they weren't kidding. The sheer number of puzzles is comparable to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's shrines, but unlike those puzzles, these ones aren't optional.In some ways, while CrossCode clearly is wearing its appreciation for games like Secret of Mana on its digital sleeves, that creates a skewed expectation for what the game really is. Yes, there is combat and leveling. But in many ways, CrossCode is much more like the more recent top-down hack-and-slash pinball-inspired dungeon crawler Creature in the Well. CrossCode's dungeons are full of puzzles, and its overworld map is, too: Pretty much every screen you traverse has at least one to two puzzles in it as well. Overworld puzzles are more about hunting for roundabout ways to jump from higher ground ledge to ledge to find a chest--only to discover the solution begins two screens back and the chest is locked with a key you've never heard of and have zero clue where to find. These puzzles are in the background, there to notice and take on if you feel like it--except for the times when they're mandatory. Those with little patience for either combat or puzzles can breathe a slight sigh of relief: The options screen has difficulty sliders to change enemy damage, enemy attack rate, and puzzle timer speed. The emphasis there is on ""slight,"" because while these sliders can make winning tough boss fights and solving puzzles easier, they aren't a magic bullet--you'll still need to deduce their winning strategies.Fortunately, just as the previously mentioned in-game critics say, the combat is strong and the staggering amount of skill trees you can unlock and invest in only makes it deeper. There is a learning curve to adjust to, but you will eventually (more through patient trial and error than anything else) get used to tossing balls for ranged attacks, melee for nearby enemies, dashing to dodge attacks, guarding to block, and juggling on-the-fly elements-gated strategies unique to each. Despite being a top-down action RPG, CrossCode often can feel like playing a fighting game in combat--especially when you unlock certain abilities deep in skill trees. This isn't a game where you can just mash buttons during combat. To survive, you need to become adept at parrying and dodging at just the right moments. And because the game boasts 120 enemy types and 30-plus bosses, there's no relying on simple muscle memory to get by; each has their own behavior and requires their own unique strategy. This all gets further compounded by each of the elemental powers being accessible at any moment--depending on how you've leveled, each elemental could instantly switch you into the equivalent of another character class like tank, damage dealer, etc.Combat has even further complexity to it with a ranking system--the more enemies you fight and kill without stopping, the higher your grade will climb, which increases the likelihood for enemies to drop rare items. And while you can stock up on healing items, the combat rank system rewards you for taking bigger risks as the higher your grade climbs, the more you will automatically heal during a cooldown. Relying on this healing system frees you up to stock up on non-healing items and partake in the game's item-shop barter system. Though you can just buy items, CrossCode has a whole in-game economy where you can swap items for other items to build a collection of merchandise that will hopefully become valuable down the road, allowing you to trade for something you could really use. But, honestly, the barter system is complex. Unless you know what you're saving up for, it's mystifying what individual trades will add up to--and why they're worth it. More often than not, I felt more inclined to brute force my way through with the gear I could find independently of these many storefronts with limited wares dotting the land.There's a similar hesitation I felt in the 100-plus side quests and challenges you'll come across. You will wind up organically accomplishing many of them--say, to kill a certain number of enemies in an area or to procure a certain number of an item. But because of the game's sprawling map and the huge, huge cast of characters you'll come across, good luck remembering who gave you the quest in the first place and where to go to collect your reward. Despite the game's many patient tutorial screens, you could be forgiven for not even realizing there even is an in-game map--though its usefulness is questionable, especially as you wander deeper and deeper into the game.Like Owlboy and Iconoclasts before it, CrossCode is the latest in a long line of longer-gestating labors of love that emerge with varying degrees of cohesion. The best thing that can be said about CrossCode is it doesn't feel at all dated or clunky on the other end of a prolonged development time. The biggest knock against it is that CrossCode can and often does wind up feeling both bloated and inspired simultaneously."
1428,Unravel,7.0,2,"Reminiscence is Unravel's defining quality. I'm not the type who goes weak at the sight of a floating plastic bag, but at the conclusion of this eight-hour adventure, I was moved by what it was communicating about my past. Its message is an uncomplicated, naked truth, powerful in its simplicity.Deliberately throughout, Unravel tries to kick loose memories submerged at the ocean bed of your mind--those you treasure, those that still hurt, those that are both--and asks you to let go of them again. Not easy, no, but helpful. It does this by looking through its own backstory, at pictures of its past, through scenes and moments that you’ll likely relate to.Hence the seaside level. The lazy afternoon in the back garden level. The cold and drizzly trip through the woods level. An identical Xerox of your life this is not, nor does it need to be. Unravel is more like an aroma you remember but can't quite put a time or place to. The memories it conjures are inexact yet poignant.Otherwise it's a fairly standard puzzle-platformer, mechanically at least. Yarny, our accident-prone, panicky hero made of wool, overcomes puzzles and obstacles by fashioning tools from his skin of string. But if you're curious about Unravel simply because you want to test your frontal lobe and thumb reflexes, this game will come off as solid but unspectacular. It isn't The Witness or N++.In a manner similar to Mario 64's castle paintings, Unravel's dozen levels are entered via framed photos dotted around an elderly lady's home. Whereas Nintendo's seminal platformer transports you to fantasy worlds of Goombas and Chain Chomps, here each picture sends you to what appears to be the time and place they were snapped in. Somewhere along the backgrounds of these 12 landscapes you'll find the subjects of each photograph, suspended in eternal camera poses, assembled in a towering glitter of fairylight. If real life has blessed you with happy memories of your own, you will see yourself in some of these photos, and it will ache.Physicists among you; please don't ruin your evening trying to make sense of the level-to-level objectives. At the end of each world, Yarny collects a knitted badge that, when returning back to the elderly lady's home in the present day, he places onto an empty scrapbook, thus populating it with photos from within each memory. Schrodinger sends his regards.How you reach each level’s finishing-line is the meat of the dish. Yarny is no taller than a wine glass and certainly more fragile, and it’s these drawbacks which amplify the challenge of something as simple as walking across a back garden. He is adorably useless, insofar as he can't swim or talk or punch or duck or back-flip or any of the arbitrary qualities of Mario and co. As he meanders through each world, Yarny's body unravels (think trail of breadcrumbs) which means if he walks too far he is reduced to a gaunt wireframe, tethered to the spot, tugging on his remaining stretch of string. Balls of wool, scattered throughout each world, must be routinely collected to replenish Yarny's ever-thinning body, and on occasion you'll also need to backtrack and simplify his trail in order to free up some slack.But Yarny's weakness is also his strength. His party trick is throwing a lasso of string out from his arm, Spider-Man style, which allows him to climb over rocks, abseil down trees, and swing across perilous puddles of rainwater. Conveniently, each level is dotted with knots of wool that Yarny can attach his string to, thus creating a range of tools from rope bridges to trampolines. Most obstacles, certainly from the second level onwards, demand a mixture of these tools fashioned in the correct order.If at some point over the past 300 years you got round to reading Gulliver's Travels, you'll know Unravel's depiction of life at ankle height is hardly innovative. The execution is very impressive nonetheless, showcasing an impeccable attention to detail as you saunter through its dusty wooden floors and lush garden undergrowth. It's the little things--quite literally--that win you over. Like how slabs of pier-wood have swollen and fractured from years of tidal abuse, or how the paint at the base of banisters has cracked and formed into a brittle skin.Much of Unravel's charm comes from how its puzzles, and their solutions, are concocted from everyday items. So a crushed can of cola is a couch-sized step, a fallen tree branch is a makeshift bobsleigh, a filthy fishing lure is an urgently required lifeboat, and a neglected bucket becomes an indispensable force field. Such imagination spreads into hazards and obstacles too. A clump of garden weeds is an impassable thicket. A murder of ravens becomes a terrifying fleet of Stuka dive-bombers. A field vole becomes your worst nightmare.Such a shame that the puzzles don’t reach the same standard. Aside from a few memorable exceptions, Unravel's underpinning mechanics prove too basic, to the extent that most conundrums aren't particularly satisfying to overcome. Eventually some solutions can be gathered just by observing the convenient placement of knots around you. The challenge becomes threadbare (sorry), with a lack of pondering and experimenting and stumbling into new problems. I found that, by level five, the challenges had lost creativity to the extent that they began to outstay their welcome. Unravel is also very good at exposing its own problems, particularly because most levels drag on a little longer than they should.Sometimes Unravel doesn't play by its own rules either. The length of your lasso, for example, occasionally stretches beyond its set limits when the game needs it to. Even more unpredictable is the distance you can travel before your woollen frame diminishes. And while tightly fastening string between knots can create bridges and trampolines, this only works when the game decides. Sometimes your lines will be limp for no reason other than Unravel wants you to solve its problems another way.Granted, had Unravel stuck to the laws of physics with scientific rigor, it would probably cease to be as fun. But for a game with physical conundrums at its core, it needs at the very least to be more consistent with its laws. Play Unravel long enough and a tiny but noticeable distrust will have built between you and the game. Devastating, really.Despite that fracture in your relationship with Unravel, you will nevertheless be dazzled by how beautiful it looks. It is strikingly rich in detail, right down to how the moss grows on the neglected side of a stone bench, and how wooden floorboards warp and splinter, to how flakes of dust blink under the gaze of a table-lamp. Yarny aside, the visuals verge on photorealism, but that’s not to say they are merely authentic; Unravel’s abandoned worlds are a ceremony of vistas, all laced a faint hallucinatory quality, like a perfect memory.The audio design is just as impressive. Unravel features no spoken words or narration, with developer Coldwood Interactive instead hinging much of the narrative on the soundtrack. The gamble has paid off tremendously. The aching sorrow of violins and panpipes, along with the inspirited Celtic folk music, swells and stirs along with you."
4223,Army Men Advance,4.0,0,"Army Men games were a moderate success when they were first introduced in 1999. After countless installments of the Sarge's Heroes franchise and just as many Air Attack releases, one of 3DO's few lucrative properties is running out of steam. This hasn't deterred the company from developing a new third-person Army Men game for the launch of the Game Boy Advance--the aptly titled Army Men Advance. While the series hasn't been overly impressive in 3D, it was hoped that the GBA's simplistic hardware would allow the company to inject some life into the property with a solid 2D installment.  Army Men Advance follows the same story that the Sarge's Heroes series has been beating into the dirt for three years now. Once again, the vile General Plastro and his army of tan figurines have decided to take over the world and it's up to Sarge and crack reporter Vikki G. to thwart the conquest. Throughout the game you'll be required to rescue team members, infiltrate tan bases, escape from a jail, investigate an extra terrestrial presence, and retrieve communications equipment. You can choose to play as either Sarge or Vikki, but the quests for each are identical and once a character has been chosen it's impossible to switch to the other unless you want to start again from the first mission.  The controls are simple yet unrefined. The A button allows you to fire your selected weapon, the B button tosses grenades, and the directional pad controls movement. Holding the right shoulder button keeps your weapon facing in one direction while you strafe in any direction and switching weapons is accomplished with the left shoulder button. This simplistic control scheme works well for the majority of the missions but in the tighter areas where there are many enemies its inadequacies become apparent. It takes far too long to get turned in the right direction and fire--resulting in constantly running away from enemies in hopes that you'll have time to turn around and shoot. In the areas where you have a small path to traverse, avoiding enemies is nearly impossible. This is made more infuriating due to the lack of a continue option--some of the missions can take some time to complete and if you die you must start again from the beginning. Another point of annoyance is that your character often gets stuck on objects and refuses to move. There are five weapons that you discover and use throughout the course of the game including an M-16, an M-60, a flamethrower, a bazooka, and grenades. The M-16 is the default weapon and it never runs out of ammunition. Using the higher-powered weapons isn't a necessity but they can make certain portions of the levels much easier. Beyond the third-person shooting that players have grown accustomed to with the Army Men franchise, there are several points in the game where you attempt to pilot gunboats and tanks through a gauntlet of enemies and hazards. There are even sections where you must cross rivers using floating logs a la Frogger. Once you rescue fellow soldiers you can take control of them and their special weapons. Considering how dull and predictable the average level can be, any sort of gameplay variety is a welcomed addition. The lack of any sort of multiplayer modes is also disappointing. While a head-to-head mode may be asking a bit much from a third-party launch game, even a cooperative mode would have increased the replay value considerably. Played from an isometric camera angle, Army Men Advance utilizes pseudo 3D graphics built out of 2D sprites. The 17 levels included in the game are similar to those from the other Army Men games. You must navigate bathtubs, bedrooms, garages, and base installations containing everyday objects at twenty times their normal size. Comprised mostly of flatly colored objects, the environments are so barren that the screen is sometimes one solid color. With only a handful of different enemies included in the game, combat also becomes monotonous rather quickly. The relative lack of bosses is also a point of contention. The explosions look passable in a cartoon sort of way but the rest of the graphics look like they could have been done on the Game Boy Color.  The sound included in Army Men Advance includes voice samples for when your character takes damage or for when the enemies die. But they are repeated constantly and quickly lose their allure. The sounds for guns and explosions are nothing special and could have been included as stock sound effects in the GBA development kit. The music consists of the traditional military fare with plenty of snare drums and flutes. The lead track sounds like a rip-off of the Hogan's Heroes theme. Army Men Advance perpetuates the franchise's legacy of mediocrity. Its graphics are at the bottom of the Game Boy Advance totem pole, none of the hardware's interesting features like multiplayer are utilized, and the one-player mode can be finished in one day. Kids will likely enjoy its simplicity but will find it difficult to complete several of the game's goals due to the irritating hit detection and cramped areas. With so many quality games available for the launch of the GBA, Army Men Advance should be near the bottom of your list."
630,Creature in the Well,8.0,2,"The Creature has laid out a dozen traps, all of which can only be deactivated by the glowing ball carefully balanced on the tip of my sword. At a glance, I can tell it's going to take an impressive display of geometry to bounce the ball into every target before an approaching laser cuts me in half. The Creature threatens that a worthless piece of trash like me has no place in its mountain before it disappears back into the shadows with a haughty growl, convinced that at least one of its pinball death machines will stop me. Unfortunately for me, this time around, it's right, and the Creature smugly returns to pick my limp body off the floor and throw it out of its well. After muttering a few curses under my breath, I pick myself up, restructure my loadout, and head back into the monster's home.In Creature in the Well, you play as BOT-C, a robotic engineer tasked with maintaining a weather machine that's built into a mountain and designed to dispel the constant sandstorms that blanket the town of Mirage. Angry at the townsfolk for encroaching on its home and ""worshiping"" a machine for protection against the storms, the Creature that lives in the town well breaks the contraption. You set out to undo the damage only to learn that the Creature has filled the caverns of its home with deadly traps to stop you.Developer Flight School Studio refers to Creature in the Well as a ""pinbrawler,"" a term coined by the studio to describe a top-down hack-and-slash dungeon crawler that utilizes pinball-inspired mechanics. It just so happens that the Creature's traps transform every room in the mountain into a giant pinball machine, allowing you to siphon energy from the bumper-like nodes that power the Creature's inventions by flipping balls into them. The energy you absorb can be used to unlock doors that lead further into the mountain.This fairly straightforward concept of hitting balls into bumpers evolves into more difficult puzzles as you delve into the areas beyond the first dungeon. Additional concepts are introduced at a steady pace, building new types of enjoyable challenges on what the game has already established so you're not blindsided by whatever you're up against next. Early on, the game only really tasks you with learning how to bank your shot, presenting puzzles where you need to angle the ball off of walls to hit nodes in a certain order. But then Creature in the Well starts adding cannons that shoot at you, lasers that disintegrate you, and other types of threats that need to be deactivated or dodged while you're also trying to position for your next shot.Few of the challenges in Creature in the Well are an equal combination of pinball and hack-and-slash. Instead, they fluctuate between the two to curate welcome variety in its dungeon-crawler gameplay. One room may not have a ball for you to use so you'll need to time your attack and use a shot from an enemy cannon as your ball, for instance, while another may task you with figuring out how it's possible to hit every node in a room within a specific time limit. Most of these challenges lean into the hack-and-slash inspirations and are more enjoyable as a result--largely because the flurry of frantically dashing between enemy traps as you try to calculate the trajectory of all the balls bouncing around the room produces the same thrill as battling your way through a difficult mob in a typical dungeon crawler.The pinball-focused rooms are designed to be a test of your intellect, but none of them are overly difficult. As a result, they mostly just stand out in stark contrast to the more plentiful hack-and-slash rooms as the handful of moments in Creature in the Well when the action slows down. They're still good, but Creature in the Well is just better as a pinball-inspired action game than a geometry-focused puzzle one, as its hack-and-slash mechanics better lend themselves to quickly overcoming obstacles through good reaction and precision instead of repeated trial-and-error. Though Creature in the Well does occasionally repeat puzzles, these duplicates rarely show up and they're typically only after the game has given you a chance to expand your arsenal or encouraged you to learn a new strategy. Tackling these recurrent puzzles with newfound efficiency each time helps reinforce that you are getting better (plus, it's really fun).Creature in the Well doesn't have much in the way of tutorials, but the game is fairly well-structured and teaches you most of what you need to know without exposition. The game never tells you that each room is optional, for example, but it provides enough opportunities at the start of the first dungeon to earn a surplus of energy so that you can try opening a few doors in the early areas without completing every puzzle. Likewise, almost as if it assumes most players will try, regardless, to complete every room at the start of the game anyway, Creature in the Well hides its first secret area relatively early in its campaign so that you learn hidden doors are only revealed by fully completing puzzles in certain rooms. In this way, you absorb enough of the basics to beat the campaign, but a few of the game's aspects that help alleviate some of its tougher challenges could have used additional explanation.The game doesn't tell you how to heal in the hub area after dying, for instance, and it doesn't explicitly reveal what BOT-C's core upgrades actually do. Without this knowledge, moments of Creature in the Well can, at times, feel frustratingly stacked against you, though it thankfully never gets to the point where the disadvantage feels impossibly unfair. And it's likely you'll eventually stumble into these mechanics and features before Creature in the Well's story is through. However, these things--that there's a pool of water in the hub you can bathe in to replenish your health and that core upgrades allow you to pull off more powerful strikes that siphon off extra node energy--feel like crucial information. Learning the purpose of the core upgrades, specifically, helped alleviate most of the struggle I was having with the late-game dungeons.There's an excellent diversity to each tool's effect--most of which seem inspired by traditional dungeon crawler powers and weapons--allowing for various playstyles.These dungeons are each structured around certain thematic challenges. To help you better respond to a dungeon's specific test, every one contains a tool designed to handle its threats. For example, the Lockdown Systems mostly contains rooms with nodes that move or require you to strike balls through a tiny opening. This area hides the Dual Blades, twin swords that help you make precision and long-distance shots by revealing a ball's travel path, allowing you to course correct before you even swing. Every tool is fun to experiment with, and it's exciting to discover how you might use a new one. And though each tool is designed for its specific dungeon, their special abilities can be reapplied in different ways to overcome the challenges found in other areas. You're thus encouraged to return to dungeons you didn't fully complete to see if the new tools you've acquired can help you solve any lingering optional puzzles you previously couldn't get past.Every tool is divided into one of two categories, charge and strike, and you can equip one of each to combine their special effects and build different loadouts for BOT-C. I most enjoyed pairing the aforementioned Dual Blades with the Focus Hammer, a strike tool that allows you to slow down time, to transform BOT-C into a sniper-like fighter. There's an excellent diversity to each tool's effect--most of which seem inspired by traditional dungeon crawler powers and weapons--allowing for various playstyles.The best moments to test out these different playstyles are in Creature in the Well's boss battles--each located at the end of a dungeon and all of which see you go up against the titular Creature. Each battle sees the Creature throw several waves of challenges at you that you must complete in a single run, with each consisting of a culmination of more difficult variations of the puzzles seen in that particular dungeon--further encouraging you to fully explore every area and experiment with multiple tool loadouts in each one. The boss battles are fast-paced and demand a higher level of tactical awareness than the rest of the game, as the Creature will also just randomly outright attack you as you're trying to hit the nodes scattered throughout the arena. Whereas most of the dungeons allow you the time to dissect how a problem can be solved, the boss battles force you into piecing together the solution on the fly.Though the abrupt change in pace between the slower dungeon puzzles and faster boss battles can be a little flustering, learning the different patterns of the Creature and overcoming them are gratifying challenges that require both careful aim and situational cognizance. Beating each boss rewards you with more dungeons to explore--and thus new challenges to tackle and tools to find--as well as lore-focused texts that further flesh out Creature in the Well's history. Though most of this lore isn't compelling enough to regularly be a fulfilling reward, the promise of more dungeons and new weapons eases away that disappointment.Both Creature in the Well's dungeons and boss battles are also improved via the portrayal of its antagonist. The Creature is terrifying, largely because you never actually see the entirety of it or learn its motivations. From start to finish, the Creature is a pair of glowing eyes and skeletal arms, most of its body covered in shadow. It growls, taunts, and even threatens you, but it never reveals what it is, remaining this demonic-like enigma that refuses to be understood or stopped. The Creature appears at seemingly random points in every dungeon, watching you from just out of your reach and cultivating this paranoia that it doesn't even have a physical form for you to fight. So when you do actually win and manage to push the Creature back a little further into the mountain, the battle feels hard-won, a boss fight on par with one in a traditional dungeon crawler.Creature in the Well manages to inject the geometry-focused experience of pinball into the frenzied gameplay loop of a dungeon crawler to craft a unique puzzle action game. On occasion, the game's hands-off approach to conveying information is a hindrance, but the well-structured dungeons and monstrous antagonist more than make up for it--producing an engaging hack-and-slash experience that allows for satisfying experimentation."
277,Forza Horizon 5,9.0,2,"For all the luxury cars that Forza Horizon 5 has to offer, the one I kept coming back to was an old Volkswagen Beetle, lovingly called a ""Vocho"" by the Mexican locals. It was a reward for a lengthy string of challenges, all taking liberties with what the recognizable but otherwise unremarkable car could be with the right love and care. More than that, it became a special car because of what it meant to one of the main characters in Forza Horizon 5's more personal story missions, letting her recount a love of racing that stemmed from her grandfather's adventures with this very vehicle. This single chapter encapsulates not only why the Horizon series has endured, but how developer Playground Games keeps thoughtfully iterating on it. It's not just about the familiar high-octane racing, it's also about the stories that people and their cars can tell, and what it means to those who continue that legacy.These moments accentuate a more personal campaign that gives your created driver more of a voice than previous entries, increasing the conversations between its ensemble of racing-hungry characters while also giving plenty of opportunities for its new locale to be explored outside of the Horizon Festival. Forza Horizon 5 doesn't replace anything with this shift in focus, but instead delivers another stellar open-world racing experience that delicately balances arcade sensibilities with the series' simulation roots. Mexico is one of the best regions the series has visited thus far, too, offering a stunning backdrop to each race while also providing varied surfaces and landmarks to make each one feel special.While the pristine countryside of Britain might have been a bit too sterile for the ridiculous nature of the globe-trotting Forza Festival, Mexico fits right in. Like the Australian outback in Forza Horizon 3, Playground Games turns the map into a tasting menu for all of the features the country has to offer, from densely-packed cities to barren sand dunes and sun-kissed coastlines. The transition from one hub to another feels natural as you zip around the map, but the visual variety that each one offers gives each corner of the map personality in a way that the series was missing in its last outing.Forza Horizon has been a technical and visual treat with each release, and this latest entry is no different. Despite releasing on both the older Xbox One and newer Xbox Series X|S consoles, Playground Games has evolved its engine to bring out even more details from the hundreds of cars on offer and the gorgeous lighting that bathes each of your excursions. One of the most impressive improvements is just the sheer density of the map; each corner is teeming with small details that make them stand out. Whether it's complicated rock formations on the edge of an active volcano bubbling with a warm, orange glow, or the light scatter and destruction caused by a furious sandstorm, Forza Horizon 5 is a stunner in both its Quality and Performance modes, and especially so on the Xbox Series X (which is where I played), letting you get the most out of your new console purchase.The variety of Mexico is not just for visual pleasure either, with each of its distinct biomes offering small but meaningful changes to racing surfaces and weather conditions that change the way races play out. Road races can only be slightly changed by a rain-slicked surface in a storm, but that same weather radically changes how a mud-covered sprint in a dense forest needs to be approached, for example. The environment allows Forza Horizon 5 to introduce new types of races, too, including Baja events (this game's version of dirt road races) that play out over the messy sand dunes near the coast, or the Wild series that reintroduces cross-country races but with far more variable surfaces to play with. Weather still gets cycled in and out during real-world week-long seasons, but these are now relegated to seasonal events as opposed to directly influencing the entire open world. Races are also designed with specific seasons in mind, so that you're not trapped in a week of conditions that you'd rather skip entirely. It's a small but good improvement over this system that debuted in Forza Horizon 4.Progression has also been slightly tweaked, with less of a focus on moving from one part of the map to another as you complete events and instead letting you author which events you want to tackle and when. As you complete races, take on open-world activities, and engage with Forza Horizon 5's latest story events, you'll be able to spend points to unlock new tiers of the festival. This includes unlocking access to specific race types, such as Apex for standard circuit races, PR stunts for daredevil antics, or Street Scene for dangerous races in crowded suburban areas. Each additional point in each festival-type opens up more story-specific events for that type, consisting of multi-tiered story missions and the more traditional showcase events that Forza Horizon has become known for.Playground Games keeps thoughtfully iterating on [Forza Horizon]. It's not just about the familiar high-octane racing, it's also about the stories that people and their cars can tell, and what it means to those who continue that legacyThese story events all feature similar formats that are changed up by the racing style that they represent, dropping you in the most interesting parts of the Mexican map. There are ancient runes and derelict airfields ripe for exploration, all on the way to setting up the next big racing festival that unlocks even more points of interest on the map. The most interesting of these are the ones that pair you up with one of the new team members and citizens of Mexico, be it a talented mechanic or budding university student looking for someone with high-speed data.These carpool sessions bounce between serious and comical, from poignant tales of the importance of a car to a family and over-the-top photoshoots that take you through some of the worst weather the region has to offer. They each layer familiar events--timed sprints to an objective, points-scoring skill sessions, or massive, physics-defying jumps for example--with a human element that has mostly been missing from the series. Hearing your created driver respond in these dialogues makes each conversation far less one-sided too, giving your legendary status as a masterclass driver more texture than just a voiceless avatar that does silly dances on the podium. Forza Horizon 5 is still miles away from what you might consider as story-driven, but these small detours do wonders for the overall pacing when there's so much racing to be done outside of them.These character-driven aspects are what stand out the most in this latest entry in the series, and one that's required given how similar it can all feel without it. The Forza Horizon series has established a formula that it's stuck to quite closely for several years now, and while it definitely doesn't feel stale in a way that many other open-world franchises can, it doesn't always have the grin-inducing surprises as it used to. Playground Games has a knack for great, exhilarating races across its incredibly detailed worlds, but there's not enough here to convince you that this is the entry to jump in if previous ones haven't done it for you. Its changes are profound enough for long-time fans to appreciate the change, but they don't have a significant influence on the overall structure that the Horizon series has become comfortable with.The variety of race events can change over time, too, especially as the community engages with the tools that Forza Horizon 5 offers to create custom events. Each race can be altered by players and played by anyone online, giving the already expansive number of races even more replayability over time. There are new types of multiplayer modes, too, that join the returning staples from the previous entry. Forza Arcade turns the arcade racing into something even sillier, with a variety of minigames contained in a small area of the map that you collaboratively participate in with other nearby players. These include a hunt for colorful piñatas that you need to smash up with your sports car of choice, or colourful demolition derbies where you need to race around knocking over giant bowling ball pins. It's a fun distraction as it stands, but it requires a bunch of players to pause the more exciting prospect of head-to-head racing in order to participate in without offering the same captivating competitive edge that the rest of the strong stable of multiplayer modes do.Being confined to a small area of the maps is also counterintuitive to what makes Forza Horizon's brand of open-world exploration so fun. Playground Games has iterated on its approach to open-world design over the course of the series, and Horizon 5 epitomizes why it works so well. It's laid out so that you're consistently rewarded for engaging with its world, even when you're just moving from one race to the next. Speed traps, drift zones, small duels with other racers, and just simply traveling in style reward you with points that drive forward overall progression, making each action feel rewarding and purposeful. It's dense with activities without also feeling overwhelming, letting you map routes from events that are littered with side activities that interest you to tackle along the way."
747,Wargroove,8.0,2,"It's not often that fans' calls for a new entry in a series are ignored, only for an unrelated developer to come along with the perfect answer. And yet that's precisely what we have in Wargroove, an apparent facsimile of the Advance Wars series, which has has been dormant for more than a decade. But while its immediate appeal lies in filling a gap that few games have in recent years, Wargroove introduces smart improvements and impressive custom content tools that make this an experience that stands on its own as a terrific strategy game.Wargroove's most basic gameplay is nearly indistinguishable from that of Advance Wars (a point of comparison that developer Chucklefish itself hasn't avoided). It's a turn-based tactics game set on a tile-based map in which you assemble an army, take control of structures that can build units or generate gold, and (usually) work to eliminate or destroy a particular target. Every action is a significant commitment; because units can't stack on the same tile and buildings can only produce one thing per turn, you have to carefully think through your strategy on each turn. The same is also true of engaging in combat; because damage is dictated by the amount of health a unit has, being aggressive can help ensure you take less damage later. None of this is new, but it serves as a solid base that Chucklefish improves upon.Wargroove rekindles not just the classic gameplay of Advance Wars, but also its visual style. The pixelated, cartoonish maps are filled with small flourishes that help them to feel alive; birds fly overhead, fires burn, and the shadows cast by clouds slowly move along the ground. When combat begins, the action shifts to a 2D side view depicting the two units squaring off and showcasing a great-looking set of animations. The best of these belongs to the dog commander, Caesar, who exhibits a frankly impressive level of nonchalance, scratching himself and enjoying his time as his crossbow-wielding attendants do all the work. (Commendably, despite the presence of dog units--battlepups!--the amount of whining they do when taking damage is kept to a minimum.) For as nice as it all looks, I did find the breakdown of units' strengths and weaknesses--which consists of small, often similar-looking portraits--needlessly difficult to read.Aside from swapping Advance Wars' firearms, jets, and tanks for swords, dragons, and magic, the most obvious change is how commanders work. Rather than serving only as a special ability that can occasionally be wielded, commanders are powerful units on the map you control like any other. In most cases, eliminating the other team's commander is one of the available victory conditions, so you always want to keep yours safe. But what makes commanders so interesting are the ways in which you're encouraged to use them aggressively.Commanders each have a unique ability--the titular Grooves--such as healing nearby units, allowing adjacent units to act again during the current turn, summoning a friendly unit, and so on. These build up passively but are gained much more quickly by eliminating enemies with your commander, who unlike standard units also regains a small amount of health each turn. As a result, you're often wise to push forward with your commander in order to maximize how often you can use your Groove. But this presents you with difficult choices. Does it make sense to hurt but not kill a strong unit with your commander to mitigate the damage it can do and kill a weak enemy with another unit? Or should your commander secure that final blow to get your Groove that much faster, but risk suffering the strong unit's next attack doing heavier damage? Units each have enemies that they are strong and weak against, and terrain can provide defensive buffs or nerfs to account for. Along with that, commanders offer an additional consideration that make even a simple engagement into something you have to more thoughtfully examine.The same can also be said for Wargroove's critical-hit system. Rather than being something that happens randomly, each non-commander unit has a specific criteria for when a critical hit will occur. Pikemen get critical hits when adjacent to a friendly pikeman, rangers when they attack without first moving, trebuchets when their target is at the edge of their attack range, and so on. As a result, you sometimes have to weigh the risk of overextending yourself to get a critical hit against the risk of leaving yourself in a more vulnerable position. In one case, you might put a spearman in danger just to ensure another one lands a critical hit; in another, you might retreat slightly with a knight on one turn so that on the next they can utilize their maximum movement range (triggering a critical hit) to kill an enemy and avoid suffering a counter-attack. The logic behind critical hit requirements is uninspired in some cases--those for naval units merely ask you to be in a certain type of water tile--but they add another welcome layer of depth to combat and an extra point of differentiation for units.How you heal your damaged units is another tricky decision. The primary method requires you to move next to a structure you own and then pay gold that would otherwise be used to buy units or activate certain abilities. But healing like this comes with the downside of trading health from that structure (which slowly regains health each turn) to the unit (which does not). At times this means you won't necessarily be able to heal everyone, even if you have the gold to cover the cost. It also can mean leaving your buildings--and thus your source of income and additional units--susceptible to being lost. There are no easy choices here, and the aforementioned health regeneration of commanders provides you with the risky option of letting them tank damage and hoping they can recover from it for free.Despite having so much to juggle, the action is rarely overwhelming. That's due in part to a manageable number of unit types being available; Wargroove's four factions are different in appearance only, although each has three commanders with their own unique Groove. While it's disappointing to realize the introduction of a new faction means very little, there are enough unit types and systems at play to keep things interesting. Having to account for dozens of additional unit types would have slowed each turn to a crawl as you try to remember how they all work.What does unfortunately slow the action down is the process of determining the danger zone in which you can be attacked. Rather than allowing you to see the full potential attack range of the enemy team, you're only able to see it unit by unit. Especially when managing expensive aerial units who can be easily downed if they end a turn within range of certain anti-air specialists, it's essential to carefully check and re-check these ranges. This adds an unnecessary layer of tedium to every turn, particularly in the large-scale battles that see significant numbers of units in play simultaneously. As a result, turns take more time than they otherwise would in order to facilitate this busywork.Those match times proved to be frustrating on occasion in the campaign. While I found myself having trouble in only a small handful of missions, those I failed often came near the end of 20- to 30-minute matches. With no way to create a mid-mission save, a loss can be dispiriting, especially if it comes as a result of an accidental click (it's far too easy to end a turn or order a unit to wait by mistake) or because you didn't notice an enemy unit and thus didn't account for its attack range.Some of my frustration in those failures stemmed from the fact that I was eager to see what the next mission held. Most offer some new wrinkle, like the introduction of a new type of unit or a different overall mission structure (such as assisting in a retreat). While dialogue is funny at times, the story is forgettable, consisting of a string of conflicts that could be avoided if characters made a real effort to explain why they aren't enemies. The story is not a major part of the experience, though, and much of the world's lore is consigned to a codex. Besides, the consistently fresh ideas the action itself offers are all the reason you need to see the campaign through.Even after completing the campaign, there are plenty of other ways to keep playing. Arcade mode presents you with a series of five battles and a light narrative wrapper for each commander, giving you a light campaign of sorts that you can see through in a single sitting. Puzzle mode more intriguingly presents you with a level that must be completed in a single turn, forcing you to ensure every move maximizes your damage output. Four-player multiplayer, with support for both local play and online, works well and presents a more worthwhile, unpredictable challenge than what the AI can muster. However, the lack of online support for private matches and AI players (available offline) are unfortunate omissions.Wargroove's greatest potential lies in its custom creation tools. These allow you to make not just maps but entire campaigns filled with main missions, side missions, and cutscenes. These can be easily shared and downloaded right through the game. While the creation aspect of Wargroove is initially overwhelming--you're left to discover the many tools at your disposal with zero direction--the end result is the ability to create a campaign on par with the one that the game ships with. Diving into this creation suite won't be for everyone, but everyone stands to benefit from those who do. One minor gripe with this setup: There's no way to jump directly into a new map when browsing for new content, and failing on a standalone map unceremoniously boots you back to the main menu.Outside of campaigns and standard missions, there's also the opportunity for map creators to develop entirely new ways to play. One example of this is baked right into the game with the Chessgroove map, which lines up two teams in a standard chess formation and permits players only a single move per turn. It's an intriguing concept, but one that quickly grows tiresome; because units aren't instantly killed as in chess, you can't quickly evaluate potential moves, turning what should be a relatively fast-paced affair into a boring slog. As disinterested as I was in playing Chessgroove again after my first match, it does offer a glimpse at what kind of outside-the-box concepts people might be able to come up with.That's good news, because Wargroove is a delight to play, and the possibility of an endless supply of content for it is a tantalizing prospect. Chucklefish could have offered up a prettied-up take on Advance Wars with online multiplayer and called it a day. Instead, it's made meaningful improvements that make this both a satisfying answer to starved Advance Wars fans' wishes and a genuinely great experience on its own merits."
2147,Crimson Dragon,5.0,1,"Panzer Dragoon series under a new name, fitted with light RPG elements and a dash of asynchronous co-op. Unfortunately, these added systems don’t make a meaningful impact on the game at large, and the genre’s focused action is perverted by wildly concocted paths that send you and the camera into a tizzy. This, coupled with unusually aggressive enemies, makes Crimson Dragon a frustrating experience. There are rare, fleeting moments of greatness near the end of the campaign, but you have to fight the urge to put the controller down if you hope to catch a glimpse of them. Plot is not Crimson Dragon's strong suit either, but it suffices in so much as it provides an explanation for your ability and need to command dragons. Not long after the colonization of the planet Draco, the inception of the Crimsonscale virus wreaked havoc on the human population and enraged the indigenous wildlife. Some people, dubbed the Seekers, were immune to the Virus. As one of the lucky few, it's your job to fight back against the rising tide, and investigate the cause of the Crimsonscale outbreak. All levels consist of phases that last from one to five minutes apiece. You ride on the back of dragons, fighting swarms of enemies, collecting items, and occasionally facing a boss or a strong group of variations on common enemies. For each phase that you complete, you're rewarded based on your performance with credits or items. Credits can be used for many purposes: acquiring new dragons, hiring AI-driven wingmen, undertaking missions, and purchasing extra-life-like revival jewels. Regardless of how many enemies you shoot down or items you collect, the most important thing is that you survive. You can attempt to better your chances by recruiting other players' dragons from the game's leaderboard, but these wingmen never make much of an impact. Granted, this fluctuates slightly based on the availability of high-level dragons and your ability to afford their contract, but the difference between low- and high-level wingmen is hard to recognize in practice. Regardless of who’s watching your back, you're still the primary target. The most any wingman ever brings to the table is a powerful but limited-use attack that hits every enemy and recharges your health. It’s helpful, but there’s no reason it couldn’t have been a function of your dragon to begin with. At best, wingmen provide you with a last-ditch attack, but at worst, they instill a false sense of security. Though the game tries to instill confidence by offering backup, Crimson Dragon’s enemies are ever relentless, even on the easiest difficulty setting. Standard enemies fire dozens of projectiles at once, forcing you to constantly barrel roll to avoid impact in the face of large swarms. In some levels, it feels like all you do is bash the shoulder buttons to barrel roll, and simultaneously hammer on the trigger to fit an attack or two in between rolls. Ostensibly, your ability to shoot down enemies and minimize damage relies on elemental relationships, which you can alter prior to heading into battle. However, though you're given a readout of the balance of your abilities and enemies’ resistances prior to starting a mission, choosing the right dragon and assigning the proper abilities rarely makes a meaningful difference. Likewise, your dragons can evolve twice, but these are mostly cosmetic changes, with an ever-so-slight bump in base stats. The imbalanced relationship between stat growth and difficulty is disappointing, but struggling to overcome these odds is nowhere near as frustrating as coping with Crimson Dragon's camera. When you're flying in a simple pattern, it's easy to settle in. The left analog steers your dragon, and the right controls your weapons' aim. Free-flying stages, which allow you to control the speed and trajectory of your dragon, turn the standard control scheme on its head by assigning the camera controls to the same stick as movement. It's confusing, not to mention ineffective in the midst of combat when you have to track fast-moving, hard-hitting enemies.   Granted, there are only a few free-flying stages in the game, but erratic paths in standard levels also prove to be problematic. Quite often, you're sent careening around corners, with an unreasonable amount of visual interference, while under fire, without enough time to react to threats. If you submit, you can simply take some damage and move on. If you attempt to kill everything and lose control, you're more likely to be unprepared when the camera finally rights itself. Fight your way towards the end of the game, and you'll discover stages with greater visual appeal than the initial selection of barren landscapes, and more sound level design, but it’s too little too late. Crimson Dragon frustrates more than it entertains. Flying your dragon can feel good, but it's only when the game takes a rare breath and slows down that it feels right. The ability to raise dragons is mildly intriguing, but they take forever to evolve into slightly more effective warriors, making the process more of a distraction than a rewarding challenge. It doesn't take long to realize that for all its efforts to be something more, Crimson Dragon misses the mark. It's occasionally sloppy, usually frustrating, and ultimately disappointing."
3553,X-Squad,5.0,1,"X-Squad takes the now-standard third-person action game concept, adds a touch of squad-based combat, some messy camera work, and controls that feel more like those of a first-person shooter. If it weren't for the overly touchy control and the game's overall lack of difficulty and length, X-Squad could have been a contender. Instead, it stands out as one of the first average PlayStation 2 games to hit US shores.   In X-Squad, you control Ash, leader of the X-Squad. After receiving a cryptic message concerning the mysterious Project Medusa, the squad heads into action, attempting to find out more about Medusa, as well as rescue the people who got too close to the project's sinister truth. Your mission manifests itself as a third-person shooter with FPS-style controls. The left stick of the Dual Shock 2 moves you around in all directions, while the right stick is used to aim. The control scheme works well, for the most part, but aiming really causes the camera to jerk around quite a bit, making it difficult to accurately draw a bead on anything. Fortunately, the game has a rather liberal lock-on system that makes aiming practically automatic. Another problem is the action button, which manipulates switches when necessary and causes your character to roll forward when you aren't near any interactive items. It's way too easy to run up to a switch and roll forward instead of hitting the switch, a timing mistake that can cause you quite a bit of shield energy or life if made in a hostile situation.   The gameplay is rather basic. You progress through each level, occasionally running into locked doors that are opened by hitting switches, which are usually nearby. Along the way, you'll encounter opposition in the form of enemy troops, automated guns, and end-of-level bosses. The troops are amazingly accurate, even on the easiest difficulty setting, making full frontal assaults a fairly large mistake in most situations. Instead, you're forced to inch forward, poking your head around corners to see if there are any guards in the vicinity. Once you've found some enemies, you can simply run out, bust off a few rounds, and strafe back to your hiding spot. Unfortunately, the rest of your squad doesn't seem to understand the tactic, and they'll occasionally just stand in the enemies' line of fire, shooting wildly until the enemy drops. You can assign different tactics to each member of your squad, but they don't have a major effect on the way the AI reacts to most situations.   Throughout the game, you're treated to quite a bit of voice acting, as the rest of your squad is constantly relaying useless information to you, and there are numerous scripted cutscenes that show your team drawing away enemy fire or getting into position for a small assault on a fortified enemy position. The voice work is, for the most part, laughable, and the characters' lips seem to be moving to the original Japanese soundtrack, making the cutscenes feel even more chintzy and out of place. Graphically, the game has a good look to it, but your characters look really, really shiny - almost as if they'd be more at home in one of 3DO's plastic-filled Army Men games. It's an odd effect. The reactions when you get hit are pretty nice, however. If your shield is taking the brunt of the attack, your whole body takes on a liquid metal-like effect while you're being hit. If your shields are down, getting hit reduces your health and causes a large amount of nice looking motion blur.   More levels and varied level design would have really worked wonders here. An additional mode (two-player cooperative, perhaps?) wouldn't have hurt, either. X-Squad is the sort of game that can be completed within an afternoon, and as such, is probably more suited for a rental than a purchase."
334,Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart,9.0,2,"Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart is a game about counterparts. In this strange new setting, everyone has a doppelganger who looks almost identical to the one we know, but their circumstances have changed them. Ratchet's new alternate dimensional counterpart, Rivet, may have had a harder life than him, and it's shaped her personality in surprising ways, but she's still the same heroic person at heart. The same can be said for Rift Apart. The new generation of hardware has made some dramatic changes for the better, but in a very welcome and comforting way, this is still the Ratchet &amp; Clank you've come to know and love.The title may be ""Ratchet &amp; Clank,"" but Rivet is the real star here. Ratchet and his robot buddy Clank are the template that helps inform what we learn about Rivet and her own journey, and the vast majority of Rift Apart takes place in her universe. She also seems to get slightly more playtime, even if the stages are split roughly evenly as the two heroes divide-and-conquer to enact their universe-saving plan.Once the game begins in earnest, after a brief tutorial in Ratchet's Megalopolis, the bumbling but sinister Dr. Nefarious transports himself and the titular duo to another dimension. When Nefarious gets there, he finds that it's ruled by an Emperor Nefarious. The Emperor is conspicuously absent at the moment, so our Dr. Nefarious just helps himself to the throne, and no one, including the evil executive assistant, seems to notice that he's a pretender. Meanwhile Ratchet and Clank are separated, and Clank is picked up by the freedom fighter, Rivet.Most of the game centers around these dimensional counterparts, who are not exact twins but rather similar characters with different names and slightly different personalities in this new world. Rift Apart rewards longtime fans with little nudging winks on how the alternative characters break from our expectations. For example Mr. Zurkon, a violent autonomous robot that has been both a weapon and a character in past Ratchet games, now owns a bar with a strict no-fighting policy. Giving the alternate characters their own identities and names helps reduce what might otherwise be confusing dialogue about who matches who. Ratchet, naturally, thinks this mysterious lady Lombax has taken Clank, but thankfully the ""heroes in strife because of a misunderstanding"" trope is resolved quickly and they begin working together.But this game belongs to Rivet not just because it takes place in her dimension, but because she's such a fantastic addition to the larger Ratchet &amp; Clank universe. Having finished Rift Apart, I would love to play a standalone Rivet game, set in this or any other dimension. Part of that is the performance of Jennifer Hale as Rivet, who introduces a disarming amount of emotional heft. Unlike Ratchet, Rivet has experienced a string of defeats from the oppressive Nefarious regime, and Hale imbues the character with little tinges of self-doubt and loneliness even as she maintains her heroic determination. This is a character like Ratchet who fights for justice, but she hasn't had a partner like Clank. Ultimately, the story is a sweet-natured but relatively conventional one about friendship and trust, elevated above its conventions by Hale and the surrounding cast.Despite the fact that the dual heroes barely ever talk face-to-face, they share one pool of equipment. The game gives a sci-fi gobbledygook explanation, but more importantly, having one weapon wheel between both characters ensures that you can switch between your favorite guns without having to pause the fun and look for what you need. Ratchet is known for its inventive munitions, and aside from a handful of returning guns like the Warmonger and Buzz Blades, almost all of the weapons are new. They largely fit into familiar archetypes, but the PS5 DualSense makes a massive difference to how the weapons behave and how you interact with them.For the most part, the DualSense lets you control different functions with a half- or full-pull of the right trigger. The Negatron Collider, for example, is an energy beam that will charge up and then hold the charge at a half-pull, and fire at a full-pull. The default Burst Pistol swaps between a fairly accurate single-shot and a less-accurate triple-shot. Several of the grenade-types use the half-pull as a targeting reticle. These functions seem deceptively simple but once I got into a rhythm, it felt completely natural to call up functions without a second thought, encouraging me to experiment with satisfyingly complex strategies. For example, a favorite of mine, the Blackhole Storm, is a gatling gun that spins up at a half-pull and then fires at full. With a little experimenting, I found you can keep it spinning without firing by easing up on the trigger, saving ammo but keeping the weapon at the ready. It's that kind of smart implementation that makes the DualSense functionality more impactful than a mere gimmick.Even the DualSense speaker is welcome. I never enjoyed the controller speaker on the DualShock 4, but here it's used to subtly signal when your weapon is charged, or to give you a crisp and satisfying ting-ting sound of collecting bolts. At some points the haptic vibration and speaker prompts blend so seamlessly it's hard to tell where one ends and the other begins.Smart implementation makes the DualSense functionality more impactful than a mere gimmick.Like past Ratchet games, the weapon upgrades come in two complementary tracks. The first simply upgrades your weapon through use, so the more you use your favorite weapons, the faster they'll upgrade. The other is obtained by purchasing nodes on an upgrade tree with Raritanium, a limited resource scattered throughout the planets. The upgrade tree unlocks more nodes as you upgrade the weapon through use, so the two systems sync together very well.Some of the weapons feel a little off with how many uses it takes to earn an upgrade, though. The Ricochet gun, which bounces off your enemies like a pinball, upgraded much later than some of my other weapons even with heavy use, and very specialized or situational weapons like the Bombardier or Cold Snap are achingly slow to upgrade. Playing a Ratchet game as I do--where I basically abandon any weapon that's already maxed except in cases of emergency--I started to find that the very situational weapons were lopsided toward the back half. That meant that I spent the last handful of encounters firing off low-level weapons so as to not ""waste"" the experience before switching to my fully upgraded arsenal to actually take the fight seriously.Rift Apart is an action platformer, and Insomniac has built further on its already robust traversal options from past games. Complementing the usual suite of jumps, rocket boots, and contextual swinging mechanics are two new moves: the Rift Tether and the Phantom Dash. The Rift Tether pulls you into a dimensional hole in such a way that it looks as if the world is moving around you, while the Phantom Dash lets you phase out of reality and functions like a dodge roll. In the platforming segments, these combine with the existing Ratchet &amp; Clank mainstays to make for some breathless, harrowing setpieces, as you transfer from rail-grinding to wall-running to rift-tethering with reckless abandon.Even better, these traversal tools sing when you apply them in combat scenarios, especially in tougher encounters when you're swarmed with enemies. The Rift Tether lets you close distances or get away for a breather quickly, and the Phantom Dash feels different than a standard jumping dodge because it breaks the continuity of your fire--including the charge for weapons like the Negatron Collider. Whether you want to risk a dodging jump to hold your fire or play it safe with a Phantom Dash is the kind of split-second risk-reward decision that makes combat feel exciting.Not all of the traversal is quite as satisfying, though. A few times you have to jump on the back of a pterodactyl-like creature named Trudi to navigate a particular stage or snag some collectibles. While it's seemingly intended to add variety, the beast feels sluggish and temperamental compared to the smooth and intuitive controls of Ratchet and Rivet. These segments are short enough that they don't detract too much from the overall experience, but they stand out as a weak spot when compared to the rest.More successfully, Insomniac mixes in moments of variety with two types of puzzle stages. A series of Clank puzzles has you placing orbs with different effects (like super-speed or heavy weight) to guide a constantly running line of Clank ""possibilities,"" Lemmings-like, toward a goal. A more action-oriented puzzle section, featuring an adorable spider-robot named Glitch, has you unlocking and then zapping viruses to open computer systems. Similar to the guns and bolt pickups, the tap-tap-tap of Glitch's tiny metallic legs sound and feel very satisfying on the DualSense. These interstitial segments aren't deep enough to support their own games, but they're a welcome brief change of pace in this one.Those puzzles are also entirely skippable if you find they're not to your taste. The challenges and Trophies aren't gated by difficulty level, and you can use accessibility options like the slowdown mechanic to finesse your way past tricky parts. Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart comes across as a game that's comfortable in its own skin and unafraid to let you engage on your own terms. Not into this or that? ""Hey man, that's cool,"" it seems to say. ""Just enjoy the rest, we're all here to have a good time."" All of this is delivered in such a refined, recognizable package that the technical prowess on display doesn't often call attention to itself. The Rift Tethers refresh your perspective almost instantaneously. Cutscenes and gameplay blend so seamlessly together you might often miss the transition. Pocket dimensions hidden throughout planets open an entirely separate environment that feel like they've punched a hole in the fabric of space. A couple of particular planets let you switch back and forth between entire realities in a snap. And load times are non-existent, either so fast that you'd never notice or hidden behind scene transitions. It makes the whole game feel cinematic and harmonious in a natural, unselfconscious way.If you do pause for a moment to take it in, it will be to gawk at the stunning visuals. The environments are richly detailed and differentiated. Both the enemies and major characters have the kinds of stretchy, expressive faces and inventive design elements you'd see in an animated feature film. The textures are so well-realized you can practically feel the difference between Clank's shiny steel and other types of painted or rough metals. Each time I reached a new planet, I would take a few moments to just rotate the camera and soak it all in. It's just astounding to look at, even if that level of visual fidelity isn't as noticeable when you're in the thick of the action.Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart is flashy and technically impressive without feeling self-important. It's just as silly, sweet, and earnest as the Ratchet &amp; Clank series tends to be, while the new generation of hardware makes this entry look and play better than ever. Like the heroes and villains and their dimensional counterparts, this one may appear different or carry itself with a new accent, but there's an underlying truth to the person underneath. At its core, it's still your trusty old pals on another grand space adventure. That's what's important."
3044,Transformers: Dark of the Moon,3.0,0,"  What makes a Transformer a Transformer? You don't need to know the difference between Soundwave and Shockwave to know that it's their ability to change from robots into vehicles, weapons, boom boxes, and other things that defines the Transformers. How strange it is, then, that Transformers: Dark of the Moon: Stealth Force Edition strips the robots in disguise of this quintessential characteristic. Here, you're limited to the Transformers' vehicle forms and their ""stealth force"" forms, which are slower, more maneuverable versions of their vehicle forms with weapons attached to them. Yes, this is a Transformers game in which you never play in robot form, and this bizarre limitation prevents it from feeling like an authentic Transformers experience. This might have been forgivable if Stealth Force Edition managed to be a fun vehicle combat game, but it isn't; it's a shallow, short, and dull game that has nothing to offer Transformers fans or anyone else.           "
4864,Alliance: Future Combat,2.0,0,"  Settle into a real-time strategy game called Alliance: Future Combat and you naturally expect a little sci-fi. The name of Serbian developer Gameyus Interactive's wannabe epic evokes thoughts of cataclysmic battles taking place many years from now, a feeling emphasized by a box emblazoned with space-age soldiers and jets that look like Vipers, as well as a plot about genetic engineering. But not so fast. All of this ""future combat"" actually takes place in the distant year of 2008. All of the fighting is done by contemporary-looking soldiers and tanks. And the gameplay takes you back in time to the days when RTS programmers had yet to figure out such intricacies as pathfinding, level design, and visual presentation.        The absurdity of the plot is the least of this game's flaws. And that's saying a lot when you consider that the storyline deals with the United States setting up a secret military base to make genetically enhanced supersoldiers in a new Middle Eastern nation called the Democratic Republic of North Dzombystan (DRND). Granted, there have been goofier stories in other RTS games, and the two campaigns that follow the saga from the perspectives of the US and the DRND are a proven staple of the genre. But no other games have ever tried to present such an outlandish saga taking place a mere 14 months from the present. Gameyus might as well have set the game next Tuesday, robot tanks and all. This absurd saga is all you get, too, as there is no skirmish option (unless you count the ability to replay finished campaign missions) and no multiplayer modes.     At any rate, the ridiculous story doesn't matter much once the game begins, as the plot isn't developed at all. You're given the barest of details when it comes to motivations, and you're typically plopped down in a generic RTS map in each mission and told to go from point A to point B, killing everybody you meet along the way. There is neither resource gathering nor much else to manage, aside from the regular appearance of reinforcements. Instructions are spectacularly vague, though, so it's probably good that the gameplay is so simplistic. Mission commanders appear in little pop-ups at the top of the screen and issue orders that are always either complete nonsense due to the game's translation problems (""Learn few things!""), or so terse that it's better to ignore them entirely and suss objectives out on your own.     But doing so isn't all that easy. Almost all of the maps in Alliance are composed of pixelated, muddy terrain (that, incidentally, looks more like Western Europe than anything in the Middle East) and grimy towns that make it very tough to spot enemy units. Soldiers are so tiny and dark that they vanish into the landscape like camouflage-wearing Waldos. Vehicles like personnel carriers, tanks, and mortar trucks are a bit easier to eyeball but still blend into the background, as they are clothed in slate gray and brown. Many missions take place at night, as well (particularly in the DRND campaign), which doesn't exactly improve the situation.     Making matters even worse, the fog of war has been cranked up so high that it is actually more of a thick pea soup of war. This visibility issue is a one-way street, because it only affects the Americans. Even though the DRND troops remain invisible to you until you're practically falling over them (which makes a bit of sense, as they're supposed to be terrorists), they have no problems spotting you from long range and opening fire. So when playing the Yanks, you're constantly hammered by rockets and machine-gun fire from enemies that you can't see and can't target.        Missions are constructed around these blind ambushes. Levels are typically artificial constructs where you need to follow a winding, narrow path from the start to the finish and deal with lots of enemy units set up to bushwhack you around every turn. Cutting across country is often flat-out impossible, due to impassable terrain (although a lot of these verboten sections sure look like gentle, rolling hills) and atrocious pathfinding. Go off-roading and units instantly start playing demolition derby. They slam into each other, backtrack and stop for no apparent reason, and even ignore commands in tight spots. Coordinating an attack across fields or hills is pretty much hopeless, as is even moving across the map in an orderly fashion. Even if the controls cooperated, there are no formations and no way to make speedy units keep pace with slower ones. So confusion is difficult to avoid unless you micromanage every step of the way. And most missions feature such a staggering number of well-armed enemies (you'll quickly grow to despise the rocket-propelled-grenade-armed rocketeers) that victory is extremely hard to achieve.     Finally, just to rub it in a little bit more, Alliance crashes and/or locks up Windows on every exit and features the most annoying death ""Arggghhhh!"" ever included in an RTS. You don't need to look back from the far-flung future of 2008 to know that this game is going to be remembered as one of the worst of the year.    "
441,The Solitaire Conspiracy,7.0,2,"As I played The Solitaire Conspiracy, I couldn’t help but wonder what other classics of tabletop gaming would benefit from the treatment that the solo card game receives here. Story-driven checkers? Chess with hero characters? Mancala with a leaderboard? The latest project from Bithell Games reimagines solitaire as a means of espionage. And while the FMV story that frames each hand is pretty predictable, the mechanical ramifications of this conceit make for a fantastic take on the traditional card game.You are an unwitting spy, kidnapped and put to work by Protega, an intel organization working outside the confines of any nation’s government. Protega is represented to you by Kinda Funny’s Greg Miller as Jim Ratio, your handler and constant companion throughout the campaign. Ratio tells you that you need to take down a mysterious figure called Solitaire, who has shut down Protega’s means of communication with their operatives out in the field. It’s your mission to regain control of this spy network.Your spy work plays out through games of solitaire. According to the credits, the versions of the game that The Solitaire Conspiracy takes inspiration from are Beleaguered Castle and Streets and Alleys. These variants are less popular than Klondike or Spider, to be sure, but they’re intuitive enough and easy to pick up. The board is made up of three columns, each with four rows. In the central column, you place the ace for each suit that’s currently in play, then build on it until you reach the King. You draw these cards from the outer columns, where the cards are dealt in piles. Unlike in some other popular solitaire variants, you can only move one card at a time, rather than picking up the furthest consecutive card in and moving the stack. But, you can move each card to any pile, regardless of suit, as long as the numeric value on the card is lower than the topmost card on the desired pile. These core rules are fairly simple, and will be easy to pick up for anyone who’s played a hand or two of solitaire before. But that simplicity provides a solid framework for Bithell Games to use as it builds out its unique, hero-based take on solitaire.As you progress through the game, you’ll unlock new suits. But, instead of the traditional hearts, diamonds, clubs or spades, each set of face cards represents a new team of spies at your disposal, each with game-changing abilities. You begin the campaign with just one team, Mantis, who, according to Ratio, “are messy, but they get the job done.” Play the King, Queen or Jack from this suit on any pile of cards and they’ll cause an “explosion,” scattering that pile’s cards across the seven other stacks in play. If you need a card from the bottom of a pile, Mantis may make it easier to access it, but the explosion will have ramifications for the rest of the board.You unlock new teams with unique skills every few levels, and this hook kept me interested across The Solitaire Conspiracy’s five-hour campaign. Learning each team’s skills is exciting and satisfying. After playing with Blood Legacy, a team that reorganizes a pile so that the highest cards rise to the top and the lowest sink to the bottom, I was stoked to finally unlock Alpha Division, which accomplishes the opposite, making it significantly easier, for example, to access a 2 or 3 buried at the bottom of a stack. Each team has its uses, but it’s up to you to determine when the time is right to use their special skills. For example, Humanity+ will explode any suit that you play them on, scattering sorted cards from the central pile back out onto the flanks. These cards need to be handled with care, especially in Countdown, a timed mode where you gain seconds back for each card played. Replaying exploded cards won’t gain you time back, so misplaying a Humanity+ operative is a surefire way to run out the clock.As you play, you gain experience and rise through the ranks. After each level gained, Ratio gives you new instructions and/or a pep talk. Often you gain a new team and unlock new missions. Once those are completed, you can come back for more missions. All of this is in pursuit of Solitaire. Ratio tells you that when you reach level 15, you will be ready to take him on and hand control of the stolen network back to Protega.As Ratio, Miller is a little distracting here. In a rare acting role, the busy host spends most of his time monologuing at the player. Miller’s built a massive audience with his high-energy affability, and that’s on full display for much of The Solitaire Conspiracy. But, when he shifts into very-serious-spy-mode, he’s less believable, speaking with a clipped intensity that doesn’t feel like a natural fit for his easygoing appeal. The small cast is rounded out by UK actor Inel Tomlinson, who plays Diamond, another spy who is often at odds with Ratio. He’s mostly fine, but isn’t given much to do.That’s the campaign’s primary problem, really. It works well as a five hour long introduction to Bithell Games’ terrific take on solitaire, gradually teaching you each team’s unique mechanics before unleashing you on the timed Countdown mode, and its enticing leaderboard. But, as a bit of FMV storytelling, it’s far too static to work well as a spy thriller. It mostly feels like a dress rehearsal via Zoom call.Outside the campaign, though, The Solitaire Conspiracy benefits from not having to split its focus between story and gameplay. As a pure solitaire experience, it’s a great, inventive take on the game millions of players know so well. Skirmish allows you to create custom games, picking up to four teams you want on your side. This mode is fine, but it has a weird quirk that will kick you back to the start screen after a completed game, instead of back to the team select. This has the implicit effect of making it feel like you should only play one round of Skirmish at a time.Countdown, however, is where the game really shines. This fantastically frantic ranked mode is what will keep me coming back to The Solitaire Conspiracy. The rules are simple: the clock is constantly ticking down, and playing cards adds time back. This iteration forces you to not only master the basics, but also to memorize each team’s abilities. In the campaign and Skirmish, your success is measured by how low you manage to keep the turn counter. You’re encouraged to take your time and make the proper move, not the quick one. But, in Countdown, you can only keep playing if you play quickly. It pushes you to approach the game in a fundamentally different way, and I love that The Solitaire Conspiracy includes both options.In the end, The Solitaire Conspiracy’s most unique aspect--its story-driven approach to the well-known card game--is, ultimately, its biggest weakness. The narrative doesn’t go anywhere particularly interesting, and if you’ve ever engaged with spy fiction to any degree, you’ll see its twists coming from a mile away. Its approach to FMV storytelling is pretty limited, with its cast monologuing at the camera from the same angles throughout. This is likely a limitation of shooting during COVID-19, but it means that the presentation feels oddly staid. We never see any espionage in action, and there’s not much dynamism to what we do see, either.But, if you’re looking for a solid take on solitaire with an interesting injection of hero-based action, The Solitaire Conspiracy is exciting, well-paced and genuinely unique. You just need to decide if you really need to play another take on solitaire. Especially given the fact that multiple variations of the game likely came pre-installed on your computer, anyway. But, then again, do any of those have hero characters?"
3912,WinBack 2: Project Poseidon,5.0,1,"  WinBack 2: Project Poseidon is a third-person shooter that has the uncanny feel of a mid-90s arcade game that never was. The matchbook-sized levels and the simple, often mechanical visuals do little to push the hardware of either the PS2 or the Xbox, and much of the gameplay can be easily summed up as Time Crisis without the light gun. It's a mostly inoffensive title that brings a certain focus to its somewhat sloppy predecessor, but it quickly becomes monotonous, and the whole experience feels too generic and nonessential to warrant much excitement.        Rather than choking itself with a story that no one cares about, WinBack 2 opts for premise over narrative, putting you in control of a team of three special operatives taking on a string of assignments that require you to run through corridors and shoot basically everyone you see--they could be international terrorists, they could be drug cartel thugs, but in the end, all that really matters is that they're shooting at you. In most scenarios, your life bar is limited enough that a few hits will take you down permanently, and playing the game as a run-and-gun shooter won't get you past the first level. Instead, the game opts for a more methodical stop-and-pop style of gameplay that puts the emphasis on firing from a cover position and waiting to take your shots.      The familiar, intuitive cover system makes it easy to take shelter, line up your shots, and then lean out and fire. You can also toss grenades and flashbangs from the cover position, though there's no blind-fire option--not that you really need one, since the AI has a tendency to simply fire from an established position, and will rarely advance on your position. Firing from an exposed location isn't recommendable, though these situations are made somewhat less lethal by the implementation of some decent auto-targeting. If the opportunity presents itself, you can run up to an enemy and subdue him without firing a shot, which can be quite useful since the game is pretty stingy with ammunition. You would think that making the most of what you've got and aiming for headshots would be the best plan of action, but oddly you can only recoup weapons from enemies if they are taken down with non-lethal force, which is done by aiming for the extremities rather than the head or torso.      The individual mechanics are functional enough, but WinBack 2 makes the mistake of mapping a surplus of contextual actions to the X button, and it's frustrating when you're trying to activate a door lock or take cover behind an object and your character just keeps performing a dive-and-roll maneuver over and over again. Each scenario is also split up into two parts, one after the other, with each part putting you in control of a different team member in a different area. There are not many discernable performance differences between the characters, but there are specific action points when you have to help out the other team member by unlocking doors or clearing out a room full of bad guys before a countdown timer runs out. These sequences could have led to a really dynamic experience, but their net effect is that you'll gain an extra dot on your life bar if you go through them with notable expediency.      Poor performance in the first half of a stage will come back to haunt you, though, as both characters in a scenario inexplicably share the same life bar, which will inevitably force you to double back and retry the first parts of many scenarios. The most significant problem in WinBack 2, though, is the plain fact that the core gameplay isn't as great as the game seems to think it is, and the action never really changes. It treats the cover-fire mechanic as though it were still fresh and innovative enough to carry an entire game, a concept that kill.switch proved wrong when it came out almost three years ago.     Incidentally, WinBack 2 includes multiplayer functionality for up to four players via split-screen, but the already clunky gameplay translates even more poorly into a multiplayer experience. The fact that all the maps are all teensy and that there's no proper multiplayer tutorial to be found in the game or in the manual to explain some of the ancillary modes doesn't help.        There's not much in terms of presentation to dazzle you, either. The Metal Gear Solid-baiting box art for Winback 2 is unusually portentous--you will play as three different characters, there will be bullets, and basically everything will be navy blue and gray. The drab environments and the army of blocky clones you'll fight look dated, and the sound design doesn't fare much better, loaded with some seriously overenunciated and wrongly inflected voice acting, shallow weapon reports, and generic ""action"" music. And if you should choose to jump into the split-screen multiplayer, the frame rate and resolution both take a gigantic hit.     The original WinBack had the benefit of hitting the PlayStation 2 not long after it had launched, before there was a surplus of options. Five years later, there's such a great selection of truly exceptional games that cover the exact same ground with so much more aptitude than WinBack 2 that the game is basically irrelevant.   "
4465,The Simpsons Skateboarding,4.0,0,"Save for Konami's original arcade beat-'em-up, the lineage of games based on The Simpsons has been less than stellar. The last two games to feature Matt Groening's maladjusted family unit, The Simpsons Wrestling and The Simpsons Road Rage, threw together the colorful characters of Springfield with gameplay that was remarkably similar to that of certain other popular game franchises. Now that pro wrestling and a Crazy Taxi clone have both been checked off the list for Simpsons game concepts, EA and The Code Monkeys have sought to mimic the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater formula to produce The Simpsons Skateboarding. The concept isn't exactly inspired to begin with, but the game itself is executed poorly enough that neither fans of the cartoon nor fans of action sports games will want to have anything to do with it.  When you begin play, you'll initially have access to only one level, as well as Homer, Marge, Lisa, and Bart as playable characters, though fulfilling objectives in the first level will unlock the subsequent level, and finishing the game will net you other playable characters like Nelson Muntz, Krusty the Klown, Otto the Bus Driver, and others. The levels you'll go through are all broad approximations of Springfield locations designed as skate parks. You'll start off in the area surrounding Springfield Elementary and move on to downtown Springfield, also visiting Itchy and Scratchy Land, the nuclear power plant, and the Springfield Gorge.    In each of the 10 levels in The Simpsons Skateboarding, you'll have to complete a set of goals before you can move on, and the goals remain largely identical from level to level. You'll start off with six quick lesson objectives in ""skillz school,"" where the game essentially forces you to master a few key maneuvers before you can move on. Once you've completed skillz school, you'll move on to the regular level objectives, none of which should surprise action sports aficionados. In each level, there's basic item collection (like grabbing three donuts), three high-score score objectives, a destruction objective (like knocking the head off the statue of Jebediah Springfield), and a letter-collection objective, which changes from level to level and includes spelling ""skinner"" or ""squishee"" or the like. Finally, each level also has a competition component where you have to earn a certain point score on a specific area on the map before the time runs out. There are also two perfunctory multiplayer games, which include a basic score-based competition and a game of horse. There's nothing in The Simpsons Skateboarding we haven't seen in a dozen other action sports games. The game will occasionally get rather devious with the item placement on some of the collection goals, but that edge is dulled by the big arrow at the top of the screen that directs you to your next objective. This simple, linear format might be more forgivable if the gameplay was solid, but such is not the case.     The gameplay is just a stripped-down Tony Hawk, with a handful of basic kickflips, grinds, aerial grabs, inverts, and manuals and a special trick or two. The limited number of tricks isn't really so bad, but the boards handle lousily, turning wide, moving rather slowly, being needlessly difficult to bring to a stop. Rotating your skater while pulling a vert trick is theoretically done with the shoulder buttons, but either the timing is incredibly specific or this mechanic is just broken, because half the time the skaters simply ignore the spin command. Grinding, on the other hand, is stupid easy, as the balance meter will stay at dead center as long as you don't move to the left or right while you're actually on the rail. The game is full of these kinds of gameplay quirks that make it unexciting to play.    As unenjoyable as the gameplay is, the single biggest offender in The Simpsons Skateboarding is its graphical presentation, which is just bad. The township of Springfield has been rendered in a flat, blocky fashion, with lots of four-sided buildings and six-sided trees, and the textures range from passable to downright awful, exhibiting lots of blur and occasionally some really nasty color banding. The actual character models do kind of resemble their animated counterparts, but their proportions don't look quite right, and joints between the distinct head, torso, and limbs portions of the models are all very visible. Remember the episode of The Simpsons where Homer and Bart fall into a weird three-dimensional world and are rendered with polygonal models? Those models are head and shoulders above anything that The Simpsons Skateboarding is even remotely capable of. Topping it all off is some really vicious and sporadic slowdown, which brings the game to its knees. The only positive thing to say about this game's graphics is that the levels are large and the draw distance is unnoticeable, but these merits hardly make up for the rest of the visual deficiencies in The Simpsons Skateboarding.  The game sounds only slightly better, featuring a blasé soundtrack of reinterpreted Simpsons themes and lots of voice samples. Actually, there's just lots of voice, but you'll hear bystanders like Apu, Barney Gumble, and Ralph Wiggum say the same few phrases whenever you get near them. Springfield Action News anchor Kent Brockman serves as commentator for the game, and he'll call out every single trick as you pull them off. With only two different inflections for each phrase, this becomes preternaturally annoying within the first level.    With so many other quality action sports games on the market at the moment, the only possible reason you might be attracted to The Simpsons Skateboarding is the Simpsons themselves. But unfortunately the game makes such ham-fisted use of the license that only the most casual of gamers or the most hard-core of The Simpsons fans will be able to enjoy The Simpsons Skateboarding. Everyone else truly has no excuse for playing The Simpsons Skateboarding and should steer clear of this tired excuse for an action sports game. "
1895,Child of Light,8.0,2,"  Unfortunately, the game's writing sometimes distracts from the emotion of its story. Characters speak in rhyme, and at times, the words they use are clumsy and forced, chosen to fit into the rhyming structure rather than to effectively communicate what the characters are thinking or feeling. At least the game has some fun with its own convention via the character of Rubella, an aspiring circus jester who goofs up every exchange, using a word that doesn't rhyme with what came before (""vocalist"") when a perfectly common and obvious word (""singer"") would have worked just fine. The Neverending Story and The Dark Crystal than of the Tolkienesque high fantasy that informs so many games. Your quest takes you high and low, to platforms held in the sky by massive balloons and into crystal caverns under the surface of the land. and everywhere you go, their melancholy beauty makes them a pleasure to behold, and their imaginative design creates the feeling that you don't know what other strange wonders Lemuria might have for you to discover. You travel through Lemuria from a two-dimensional side-view perspective, and though you're bound to the ground like an ordinary girl when the game begins, early on you gain the power of flight. There are plenty of treasure chests for you to discover and optional side quests to complete, giving you an incentive to venture off the beaten path, soar up into the skies and explore every nook and cranny of these lands. Many areas also have environmental hazards and traps for you to avoid, and though these never pose too much of a challenge, they make navigating the world a bit trickier and more involving than it would be if it didn't have any dangers. The real danger of Lemuria is in its monsters. You can see them in the environment which typically makes avoiding them easy, but more often than not, you'll want to fly into them, both because Child of Light's combat is enjoyable and because you'll want to level up your characters to prepare them for the challenges ahead. Battles are built on a foundation of traditional turn-based role-playing game combat, but there are enough wrinkles here to give you plenty to think about. You can rarely just spam standard attacks endlessly on your way to victory. You can only have two characters in combat at any one time, but you can swap out one character for another instantly when his or her turn comes along, and switching between characters with the offensive muscle you want and those with the healing abilities you need to stay alive is one concern. And you can use the glow of Aurora's firefly friend Igniculus to slow down enemies' progress along the timeline. Your goal with this is typically to have your attacks strike enemies just before they would have attack you, which interrupts their attacks and knocks them backwards on the timeline, effectively denying them a chance to act. It's particularly satisfying to get into a rhythm where you keep knocking enemies back, using Igniculus to slow them down just enough so that they're right where you want them and then using your characters' own attacks to interrupt them again and again. Battles are also rewarding because of the steady clip at which your characters level up. After almost every battle, at least one of your characters advances, getting boosts to stats as well as earning skill points that you can use to unlock additional stat boosts or more powerful skills. Of course, it's fun to see your characters become stronger over the course of the game, but what makes Child of Light meaningful is the way that Aurora grows emotionally stronger. Eventually we have to leave the realms of fairy tales behind and face the challenges of reality once more, but Lemuria is the kind of fantasy realm that stays with you as long as you remain a child somewhere in your heart."
2145,LocoCycle,6.0,1," Who could have imagined that a game featuring so much ridiculousness could be boring? Well, it's not all boring, though most of the fun comes not from the act of playing LocoCycle, but from watching it. Clever live-action cutscenes introduce you to Iris, Pablo, and a variety of other kooky characters, laying out the events that lead to a motorized battle machine dragging a Spanish-speaking mechanic down the open road. These wacky scenes had me laughing out loud frequently, especially during the first 30 minutes. Iris' translation functions are fried early on, so she constantly misinterprets Pablo's cries to be set free as encouragement, and she lets loose hysterical one-liners proving her single-minded focus. ""Pablo, do you think in Scottsburg, Indiana, that the streets are paved with flags?"" she drones. ""I hear that freedom rides an eagle, which rides a motorcycle."" Elsewhere, the references fly fast and furious, with Iris dropping quotes from Top Gun, Back to the Future, and Allstate insurance commercials. (Though I wouldn't argue that Pablo is, in fact, in good hands.) The giggles flow freely when the evil motorcycle called Spike picks up his own happy-go-lucky human companion. While Pablo routinely begs Iris for sweet release, Spike's jocular friend keeps a grin firmly plastered on her face. She happily sips iced tea as Spike pulls her down the open road, and the strange situations that duo finds itself in are great sources of chuckles. As for Iris and Pablo, Pablo's dialogue is all in Spanish, with subtitles splashed across the bottom of the screen, even during gameplay. At first I was annoyed that I had to keep taking my eyes off the action so I could read Pablo's dialogue. But in time, you realize that Pablo has absolutely nothing to add, and that you can safely overlook his repetitive pleas, just like Iris does. And truth be told, the game's biggest joke--having Iris pulling Pablo down highways and across rivers--is stretched thin by the time you reach the end after about two hours of play. LocoCycle has no sense of when enough is enough. Typically, you drive down the road as you might in a driving game, though there is no danger of crashing into guardrails and dying a fiery death; the game just nudges you back on track as an on-rails shooter does. You usually take down the vehicles and robots that hound you in one of two ways: either by shooting them from behind with your unspectacular guns or by mashing buttons in similarly unspectacular hand-to-hand combat. Or would that be bumper-to-bumper? In any case, the cartoonish cars and trucks that speed in front of you erupt in sparks as you fire at them, but the shooting sequences suffer from sameness and are kept separate from the melee sections. More importantly, there is absolutely no sense of danger, and thus no tension instilled. LocoCycle is the easiest game I have played in quite some time. There is little need to swerve around traffic, and there are no nail-biting shootouts between you and your enemies. The gameplay is a mechanism for delivering jokes, not for delivering interactive fun. The close-quarters combat also suffers from a major dose of shallowness. At first, these sections prove to be a visual delight. Iris leaps into the air and pummels flying combatants in jetpacks with her tires and chassis, occasionally tossing poor Pablo around like a spinning top. (That's gotta hurt.) But once the craziness of the concept wears off, you're left with a simplistic combat system that only requires you to hammer on the same two buttons over and over, occasionally hitting another button to counter an attack. These battles are so easy that I don't think I missed an entire counter in the game, and I racked up enormous combo scores without breaking a sweat. The whole idea of combo scores in this game is silly, actually, given how aimless mashing makes you an instant LocoCycle expert. You earn points to unlock passive benefits, but I'd unlocked them all before I even hit the final stage, and none of them meaningfully deepened the gameplay. Its roads may be bumpy, but LocoCycle feels oddly flat from beginning to end. LocoCycle does try to diversify, but most ideas wear out their welcome before the game moves to the next one. Side-view boss battles are fun diversions at first, but the bosses repeat the same few attacks over and over again, and possess so much health that it takes seemingly forever to bring them down. A top-down vertical shooting sequence is a nice change of pace for two waves, but it, too, fails to rise above the most basic ideas. By the time I hit the third wave, I was bored. By the time the fourth wave arrived, I was actively annoyed. LocoCycle has no sense of when enough is enough, and as a result, too many of these detours feel like padding as opposed to creative variations. ""I hear that freedom rides an eagle, which rides a motorcycle."" Ninja Blade in all their dramatic insanity. You dodge falling boulders and careening school buses, evade Spike's frightening chained wheels, skim under semi trucks, and hang perilously from speeding helicopters. There's also a joyous minigame that has Iris flinging Pablo forward like a saw blade and spinning through legions of oncoming agents riding hoverbikes and surfing missiles. I loved seeing LocoCycle through to its zany finale, because I enjoyed the jokes and Iris' robotic line delivery, and because I loved seeing the characters get themselves into silly situations. This would have been a great short comic film. But LocoCycle is a game, and in an unexpected twist of fate, it makes the act of catching rockets, fighting soaring robots, and rushing through the rural fields outside of Scottsburg, Indiana, blander than they deserve to be."
244,Land of Screens,6.0,1,"Land of Screens begins as life as Holland knows it comes to an end: After five, long years together, her partner has just called it quits on their relationship. Before she even has the time to process her feelings and what this means for her life, Holland finds herself pacing around her bedroom thinking about how others will process the news, and thus begins to search for the right way to share the news on social media. As she debates word choice and attempts to find the middle ground between detached and devastated, she realizes she's been tagged in her ex's breakup announcement, which naturally leads to a wave of comments and bad feelings she'd rather ignore.Desperate for some sort of outlet, Holland racks her brain for someone she can reach out to. However, it doesn't take long for her to realize that--thanks to being in a comfortable relationship, her busy work schedule, and the advent of social media--she's failed to actually nurture her relationships in a meaningful way and feels a bit isolated. Holland ultimately decides to pay her ever-accommodating childhood best friend, Cody, a visit, tacking on a quick detour to her already busy weekend filled with a work conference and a family reunion. She quickly packs her things and heads over to Cody's home, realizing a bit too late she forgot her charger and her phone is nearly dead.While Holland finds little ways to keep her phone just charged enough to reach the places she needs to go (and be reminded of her breakup), what ensues is a series of situations where she is tasked with getting people off their phones in order to foster connections and make people a bit happier. These events take the shape of short, point-and-click adventure sections, wherein you must walk around a given environment and figure out ways to make people lose interest in their tablets, phones, and imitation Nintendo Switches. Each of the game's handful of levels requires a bit of light puzzle solving as you talk with folks and interact with objects in an attempt to figure out what will coax them away from the blue light's glow. However, these puzzles--along with much of Land of Screens--suffer from one major drawback: They're just way too straightforward.Land of Screens' few puzzles require no strokes of cleverness or close inspection to resolve. Instead, Holland must merely talk to people until they have nothing left to say and things more-or-less work themselves out. While some simplicity is nice, ultimately these tasks end up feeling like small-scale fetch quests as you click back and forth between characters.Even more unfortunate is that the game's narrative also suffers a bit from the same over-simplification problem that makes everything feel a bit too on-the-nose We all know that for all the benefits and conveniences social media, the internet, and technology as a whole offer us, there are just as many downsides. It's all too easy to become dependent upon your digital devices and the validation of people who barely know you--it's all too easy to trade in genuine happiness and your ability to live in the moment for the appearance of happiness and the ability to post about that moment. The entirety of Land of Screens is spent attempting to drive that point home, but unfortunately the game doesn't go about it in a subtle or innovative way. At times, it feels a bit more like the game is lecturing its characters (and you) more so than it's reflecting upon the issue in a sympathetic and insightful way.A lot of this stems from the game's lack of nuance. All of Land of Screens' online-obsessed characters come across as caricatures, from the selfie-obsessed fitness bro and dog-loving girl riddled by anxiety, to online trolls and the kids at the family reunion who just won't stop playing those darn video games. In addition, all of the interesting things that could have been said about how technology is a tool that can foster real-life connections are left unspoken. This is especially interesting considering Holland makes new friends on her journey that she intends to keep in contact with via phone or social media, engages with people who use the internet to interact with others/find events to attend, and speaks to people suffering from social anxiety. While the game's core message is absolutely true--we are too reliant on social media at the expense of forming real connections to our others and ourselves--the way it goes about talking about it feels slightly belittling.There is an undeniable sweetness, however, to Land of Screens. A large part of this comes from the game's soft and lovely vector art style, which adds a youthfulness and charm you can't help but admire. The message, while not expertly executed, is also incredibly earnest, and Holland's journey to rekindle her relationships also leads to some tender moments that might make us reconsider our own approach to our relationships as well as where we draw our sense of self-worth from."
3966,Daemonica,5.0,1,"  If you've ever been stuck in a small, boring town with little to do but talk to unpleasant locals and pick weeds, then you have a pretty good idea of what it's like to play Daemonica. This is an adventure game first and foremost, though the puzzles are few and mild at best, and the inclusion of a potion-making element and a real-time combat system--while laudable in concept--ultimately do little to abate the tedium.        You play the role of Nicholas, a brooding tattooed man in medieval England, living the life of a ""hunter,"" someone who uses their knowledge of potions, the afterlife, and the ancient language of Daemonica to hunt down killers. His line of work brings him to Cavorn, a truly miserable village with murky skies, drab buildings, and a borderline-hostile population. Here, a young undertaker has been freshly hanged by a craven bully of a mayor for the savage murder of the undertaker's fiancé as well as a reclusive couple. Though the mayor himself summoned you to basically back up his shortsighted, impulsive actions, it's quickly apparent that the undertaker is not the killer, especially once more locals start coming up missing. So, through lots of stilted conversations, randomly wandering the city-block-sized village, some light alchemy, and the occasional swordfight, it's up to you to figure out just what exactly is going on in Cavorn.     There is a lot of talking in Daemonica--too much, in fact. Nearly all of your interaction with other characters starts and ends with a dialogue tree, and the game's not afraid to pack on the exposition during conversation. Even for its paltry size, the village of Cavorn is pretty underpopulated, and you'll end up speaking to maybe a dozen different people over the entire course of the game. Some of the characterizations are pretty pronounced, but there's not much for sympathetic or even mildly likable characters. The actual conversations are usually text-only affairs, though there are also plenty of voiced sequences where an embarrassingly miscast Nicholas drones on and on, almost defying you to find something redeeming about the character. As a story-driven game, Daemonica fails to deliver a very compelling story or cast of characters.     The best trick a hunter can perform is to brew up a potion known as soulgreep, which lets the drinker commune with the dead, who are often quite knowledgeable about the details of their own demise. You'll concoct several different types of potions over the course of the game, and they all require you to harvest specific plants you'll find around the village. This could have been a fun and organic addition, but there are only six different kinds of plants to be found, and after a few hours of wandering, it becomes apparent that the plants only have a few different places to grow. Since the game gives you clear and precise instructions on how to make the different types of potions you'll need, of which there are really only three or four, the whole process is just tiresome for most of the time.     The soulgreep potion just about kills you when you drink it, sending you into a special chamber in the afterworld where you can request the presence of a specific soul. This happens several times over the course of the game, and it serves as a recurring puzzle, since you need to know how the person died, what motivated them in life, and what sign they were born under. Though working out the kinks of how the system works can take you a few tries the first time, knowing what information you need to be looking out for, plus the fact that your journal will retain any pertinent details that you might not have picked up on during one of those incredibly dull conversations, makes each subsequent journey into death a total cakewalk. And, if worse comes to worst, the number of options you have to choose from in each scenario is so limited that it's not that tough to just brute-force your way through.     The game also throws a few swordfights at you, which are always one-on-one affairs that require you to just hold the spacebar to block incoming attacks, then click repeatedly on your mouse to dish out sword slashes. There really isn't any more depth or strategy to the action than that, and it's easily the most tacked-on feature in the game. Daemonica touts that it has alternate endings, but in practice, all you get is some anticlimactic scrolling text, and the decisions you make that affect the ending are so late in the game that you need not alter your gameplay style dramatically to see them all.        Though there are a few subtle puzzles for you to get snagged up on, it will likely take well less than 10 hours to get through Daemonica, but the game's generally unpleasant presentation will make it feel like much longer. Despite the morbid, supernatural nature of Daemonica, the world itself looks flat and bland, and it's so small that you'll know the whole thing front to back before it's all over. There are only a few different unique character models that get recycled a few times, all of them uniformly crude in design and stiff and mechanical in animation. As mentioned before, the voice actor for Nicholas is quite bad, sounding like someone trying very hard to do a stern British accent and failing miserably. There are a few pieces of music that kick in pretty much randomly. Some of the music is actually okay for setting the mood at first, but it all repeats so often that the effect wears off quickly.      There are some decent ideas at the heart of Demonica. The macabre premise of talking to the dead to punish the living, conjuring useful potions out of found ingredients, and mixing adventure-game dialogue and puzzle conventions with real-time combat are all fine ideas, but in practice, the result is something too dull for the average player and too easy for the weathered adventure game enthusiast.     "
3509,Mass Effect 2,8.0,2,"  Now this is what Mass Effect 2 is all about. This excellent add-on has great action, a smattering of memorable moments, and a final sequence that's unlike anything you've seen in the series thus far. Overlord is a short but sweet microcosm of what makes the main game so entertaining, spiced with a neat hovercraft and a few quick puzzles to vary the tempo. The vehicular sections are a missed opportunity, and some of Mass Effect 2's occasional glitches have carried over into the latest content. But these minor gripes barely lessen the dramatic impact of Shepard's latest mission--which also happens to be one of his (or her) best.       Mass Effect 2: Overlord begins with a summons to a newly marked planet on the galactic map, where Cerberus has been conducting some rather questionable--or perhaps honorable, depending on your viewpoint--experiments. The problem? A chilling virtual intelligence has sequestered itself in a fortified research facility, and the project's lone surviving scientist warns you of potentially dangerous consequences if you don't stop this malevolent entity from spreading its influence across the galaxy. And Overlord does a terrific job of impressing upon you the maliciousness of this viral consciousness. The VI's digitized groans that plague you during your adventure are absolutely chilling and only grow more so as you begin to understand its growls. Haunting new music instills a palpable sense of tension, and the dark interior spaces provide a sinister contrast to the shimmering waterfalls and scorching lava rivers on the planet's surface.         Mass Effect 2: Overlord features a nice mix of gameplay elements, punctuating shooting segments with scripted set-piece events and smooth vehicular exploration. You even solve some light puzzles in between exciting encounters and tension-building travel, such as one in which you use a console to move platforms about so you can cross to your destination. It may only last 90 minutes or so, but at $7, this is one downloadable delight Mass Effect 2 fans shouldn't miss.     "
1348,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,8.0,2,"Blood and Wine is sometimes as thematically dark as its predecessors. The vampire-focused main story explores the creatures’ innate lust for blood, among other quirks and passions, and the related scenes are dramatic and distressing in fine Witcher tradition. Yet compared to the rest of The Witcher 3, Blood and Wine is brighter and more ebullient, downplaying the melancholy and bringing humor to the forefront. That isn’t to say that this series has never been funny; in fact, it’s always possessed a wicked sense of wit. The humor has never been this ubiquitous or straightforward, however. You might hear a local singing “El Condor Pasa” under his breath as you pass by on your search for a statue’s missing testicles, or you may do a double-take when you notice not-so-subtle references to GOG.com, publisher CD Projekt’s digital storefront.The self-referential humor reaches a head during a side quest involving hallucinogenic mushrooms, though it’s best that I don’t reveal the specifics. Suffice it to say that developer CD Projekt RED has no qualms about making fun of its own foibles. I can’t say the references always work in Blood and Wine’s favor, though. All too often, the fantasy I wanted to be living reminded me of the world I actually inhabit. Perhaps if Blood and Wine’s main story and characters were more engaging, the references wouldn’t have been so distracting, but none of Geralt’s new cohorts can match Yennefer’s lusty spark or The Bloody Baron’s brutal sorrow. Dwarfs in this universe have often been bankers--but in Blood and Wine, that’s almost the only role they play. It’s sensible, then, that the game’s most boring quest envelops you in a morass of financial red tape at the hands of a dwarven-run bank. And it isn’t made less boring by the quest’s knowing references to its own tedium.Don’t get me wrong: it’s easy to pick apart these details only because The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt is such a stunning game that anything less than phenomenal is bound to stand out for being “merely” great. I missed the diversity of the old cast--Toussaint is inhabited mainly by normal humans--but I still got swept up in the populace’s squabbles and stresses. Family drama is often at the forefront (one of blood’s several meanings in Blood and Wine), whether that family be a set of violence-minded brothers, estranged sisters, or a married couple that continues its petty bickering even in death. The finest quests, however, are those that begin with odd mysteries and tell the bleakest tales. What should you make of a creature that collects thousands of spoons, and what is the best way to confront the curse that afflicts it? How is it that a tree can bleed, and what role does a local witch play in the matter?The combat scenarios rising out of these quests are similarly involving. Blood and Wine sets a challenging tone straight away by pitting you and a group of friendly knights against a charging colossus, and even if you enter the expansion at the suggested level of 35, you might find the battle more taxing than expected. Toussaint hosts a parade of grotesquely beautiful creatures prepared to defend themselves at any cost. Some of these sequences grow repetitive--how many predictable battles against those pus-spewing plants did the game really need?--but most are fun not only in their own right, but doubly so because of how they’re intertwined with the adventure surrounding them. In one quest, for instance, you accompany a photographer of sorts on an expedition to catalog the local wildlife. It’s a terrific mix of scouting with your Witcher senses, protecting your buddy from burrowing centipedes, and engaging in Blood and Wine’s delightful small talk, all of it capped by an adorable and memorable sequence involving peacocks.Blood and Wine’s new mutations system is there to ease at least some of the challenge. It delivers an additional array of passive bonuses, and also unlocks new skill slots. (And thank The Fire for that.) You can skip the side quest that reveals this system, but I wouldn’t recommend it, lest you end up wasting skill points on abilities you don’t care to use and have no slots for. The addition does have a bit of a balancing issue, however. Blood and Wine goes from a nicely challenging adventure to somewhat of a cakewalk when you enable the skill that adds a freezing effect to the Aard sign. Pushing away a horde of bandits with a fling of the wrist is even more delightful when some of them freeze and shatter on the spot, I admit, but the final battles lose a bit of their sting when you have such power at your fingertips. (I cannot deny the cleverness of those battles, however, from both a mechanical and a visual perspective.)The other notable addition is Geralt’s estate and vineyard, which you can upgrade by spending a bit of coin for a new bed, weapons racks, and other sundries. The vineyard is a minor element, all things considered, but it offers yet another chance to admire Blood and Wine’s extraordinary attention to detail. You get to name the wine your vineyard produces, and then nab and quaff bottles of it once it’s in production. Depending on your earlier choices, you might bring on an unexpected staff member to arrange meals, giving an otherwise unrelated quest additional emotional heft.The vineyard is also thematically appropriate, in two distinct ways. Firstly, Toussaint is wine country, so it’s sensible enough that Geralt would be based at such an estate. More importantly, however, the vineyard is a commemoration of Geralt’s adventures, as is Blood and Wine in its entirety. An artist paints Geralt’s portrait; you fight in a tournament, possibly under a crest that represents an almost-forgotten past; you celebrate your accomplishments with your major-domo with a glass of your own wine. These are all acts of tribute, a send-off to a hero. And make no mistake: Blood and Wine sees Geralt as a hero, not just as a monster-hunter for hire, no matter how much you haggle over your fees. The vineyard is a symbol of the retiring hunter, who leaves behind not just a mass of griffon entrails, but a legend referenced throughout Toussaint’s entire culture."
583,Shenmue III,5.0,1,"Shenmue III is an anomaly, a game that feels like it doesn't really exist. It's as though it was beamed here from a parallel universe where the Dreamcast was an ongoing success and early-aughts game design remained the norm decades later. The truth is much more banal, of course: It's the result of a (sometimes rocky) crowdfunding campaign and the hopes and dreams of a fervent fanbase. Unfortunately, while it's fascinating as a weird curiosity from a long-gone era of gaming, it's simply not that fun to actually play.Shenmue III picks up right where the last game left off--as though 18 years haven't passed since players wrapped up Ryo Hazuki's last adventure--resolving Shenmue II's cliffhanger in a way that's surprisingly unexciting after such a long stretch. Once that's over with, Shenmue III's story revolves around a small martial-arts village in the middle of China (and later, a larger harbor town), as he investigates various happenings, interacts with the populace, and engages in time-wasting activities like mini-games, gambling, scrounging for herbs, and levelling up his fighting skills. In other words, it's Shenmue.In terms of setting, Shenmue III succeeds quite admirably in making the world pleasant to be in. There are some gorgeous vistas both in and outside of Bailu village, making the day-to-day strolls warm and inviting. The village itself is a charming setting, too; it's filled with interesting landmarks that give it character, like a massive sunflower garden and a small collection of gambling facilities on the riverbed. Niaowu, the port city where the game's latter half takes place, also feels like a real and engaging place, with the massive variety of shops you'd expect from a trading city on the water. The characters who live in these places also give them a nice flavor; NPCs all look distinct, have individual quirks and personalities, and are easy to recognize--which is nice when you have to find and talk to specific people in the absence of quest markers.Shenmue III retains a lot of old favorite activities from previous titles--collecting capsule toys, gambling with games like Lucky Hit and turtle races, simple arcade mini-games like whack-a-mole, and the all-important Shenmue staple of forklifting--while also introducing a handful of new activities. You can wander around the countryside looking for herbs, selling and trading sets for money and valuable scrolls that teach Ryo new attacks, or you can kill a few hours fishing and hope your day's catch will net you some money and a cool prize. If you need some fast cash, you can do manual labor and chop wood in a brief minigame. And if self-improvement is your goal, there's always spots to train and raise your martial arts proficiency.Exploring all of the side activities and enjoying the atmosphere of the locations in Shenmue III is fun, but it highlights one of the game's biggest problems: How utterly boring and unengaging the main story is. Ryo is still a dull-as-dishwater character who we're told is motivated by a sense of vengeance and justice, but his wooden dialogue and complete lack of a personality totally undermine any sense of urgency or intrigue this ongoing martial-arts drama might have. It doesn't help that the main plot moves like molasses, often requiring repeated, tedious wandering and interaction to find the character or place you need to get a tiny sliver of information that moves the plot along ever-so-slightly and unnaturally gating you off from places.For example, It takes hours to find a pair of thugs at the game's beginning that you probably could have chased down in minutes if you were allowed to enter the area they're in from the get-go. Usually games gate off areas in order to better pace out the narrative they're trying to tell, but nothing interesting happens in the hours between the game's beginning and the confrontation with the thugs. I found myself frequently opting to do everything except what I needed to do to advance the story, not because the mini-games were particularly amazing (though they are quite satisfying), but simply because the story itself was so unengaging that I preferred to spend my time doing practically anything else instead of moving it along.It's not just the pacing of Shenmue III that's a holdover from the Dreamcast era, either. There's all sorts of mechanics that, seen through a modern lens, are downright nonsensical and only serve to make the game less fun. For example, there's the stamina system: Ryo has a stamina bar that continuously drains even if he does so much as stands around, falling significantly faster if you choose to do activities like training, working, or even just running to get to a place more quickly (since fast travel is limited). Ryo needs to eat constantly in order to refill it throughout the day, and woe be to you if you stumble into a fight with less-than-ideal stamina, since it doubles as your life bar. In a game where exploration is a focus, it's a baffling mechanic that only frustrates.Then there's the dialogue, which is every bit as unnatural and awkward as it was in previous games. If for some reason you find yourself in a conversation you didn't want to be in, you can't just cancel or even button-mash out of it--you're going to have to listen to someone babble on until Ryo clumsily apologizes for bothering them and escapes. Since you're often in situations where you have to bother everyone you see to find a person with the info you need, you're going to hear a lot of pointless blather. While there are some fun characters with cute personality quirks that are entertaining to engage with, a lot of the dialogue seems like banal filler meant to make conversation seem substantial when it really isn't.The worst element of Shenmue, however, continues to be the combat, which is every bit as clunky and unsatisfying as it was back in the Dreamcast days. You're forced into an awkward angle where it's hard to see everything around you (which is awful when you have more than one opponent), the button combinations needed to perform various skills don't flow together well, and it simply feels laggy and unresponsive as a whole. You can ""cheat"" somewhat and simply do training exercises to level up your strength and stamina if you want to struggle a bit less with fighting, but it still doesn't serve to make the combat itself any more fun."
2972,Driver: San Francisco,8.0,2,"Driver 3 to rest and reinvigorates the franchise.        Driver: San Francisco picks up where Driv3r left off; it continues the story of Tanner and criminal mastermind Jericho. After escaping from Istanbul, Jericho takes refuge in San Francisco, only to be tracked down and imprisoned. However, a routine prison transfer gives him the opportunity to escape. Tanner gives chase and--after an explosion-filled action scene of Michael Bay proportions--catches up with the criminal, only to be run down and left in a coma. It's in Tanner's coma-induced dreams that Driver takes place; the battle against his coma manifests itself as the hunt for Jericho and real-life news reports on the TV in his hospital room influence his actions. While the narrative is completely implausible and at times downright confusing, it allows Driver to free itself from the shackles of the real world and introduce the unique shift mechanic that underpins the entire game.     Shifting allows you to take control of any vehicle with just a few buttons presses. Activating shift lets you float above the city, from varying levels of zoom that allow for up-close views of roads all the way to a bird's-eye view. You can highlight any car you like, and with another button press, you're in the driver's seat, ready to take on the criminal horde. With a city the size of San Francisco, the gameworld is huge, and there are hundreds of miles of road for you to drive on and explore. Fortunately, any worries about laborious driving to reach missions are laid to rest with shift. Zooming out to a bird's-eye view allows you to see all of the missions on the map, which are marked by clear icons that, when hovered over, detail the content. You can zip from a mission on one side of the city to another in seconds, minimizing downtime and letting you get straight into the action.        There are a huge number of missions available, with a wealth of types from which to choose. Even for something as simple as racing, there are multiple types, such as checkpoint racing, with marked and unmarked routes; smash racing, where you have to smash objects along the route to gain time; and team racing, where you have to shift between two competitors to ensure that they finish in first and second place. Then, there are the police missions in which you have to chase down criminals by using your boost ability to ram them off the road or shift into oncoming traffic to ram them head-on, with replays letting you view the carnage in glorious slow motion. The stunt missions are the most fun: You have to perform feats of daring driving, such as drifts, handbrake turns, and huge jumps over moving vehicles.     Each of the main missions has a story attached to it. Sometimes they relate back to the main narrative, while others involve ordinary citizens who've gotten themselves into a spot of trouble, such as parents whose child has been kidnapped or irresponsible teens who have entered street races. These stories aren't especially engaging, thanks to corny dialogue and merely passable voice acting, but references to kitsch '70s cop shows and past Driver games let you know the game never takes itself too seriously. To progress, you have to complete most of the story-based missions to unlock Tanner missions, which reveal more about his history with Jericho and his current condition. In addition, there are heaps of optional missions scattered around the city. Completing them awards you with will power points, which are also given to you for daring driving such as overtaking in the wrong lane or big drifts.        You can use will power to buy new cars, which are available from garages around the city. All of the vehicles are officially licensed, and there are a lot from which to choose. They range from slower vehicles, such as Fiat 500s, to supercars, such as Ford GTs and Zondas. More cars are unlocked as you complete missions or when you buy extra garages, including classic models and cars from films. Buying extra garages unlocks yet more bonus missions to play through as well. If that weren't enough content to keep you occupied, you can collect tokens from around the city, which open up missions inspired by classic movies. These remove your shift and boost abilities, making you rely on good old-fashioned driving skills to complete them.        Each car shares the same over-the-top feel--think Hollywood car handling rather than all-out realistic. Performing handbrake turns, doing reverse 180s, and driving under moving trucks is par for the course, though there are subtle differences between cars. For example, American muscle cars, such as the Ford Shelby GT, are very fast but a handful around corners, while cars like the Aston Martin Rapide combine speed with better cornering ability. Neither is particularly great off road, so there are Land Rovers and Baja Bugs for sale that let you tackle such missions with ease.     Thanks to the official licences and detailed visuals, each car looks the part too. There's a real feeling of pride as you drive around in your newly acquired supercar, with the sun glinting off the shiny paintwork along with the reflection of passing buildings and signs. Cars don't stay that way for long, though, with crashes and aggressive driving taking their toll on your car's bodywork. Windshields crack and lights smash, while hoods and side panels fly off in all directions. The environments are less impressive, but a lot of life has been injected into the city. Roads are always filled with cars, requiring you to weave through traffic at breakneck speeds to complete certain timed missions. It also means there's always a car around to shift into, so you're never left empty-handed. There are also lots of pedestrians on paths, which add to the living feel of the city--even if they have the uncanny ability to leap out of the way of speeding cars at a moment's notice.        Even if you exhaust the many hours of content in the single-player modes, Driver features a range of multiplayer options, including split-screen. There are six different types of multiplayer on offer, each using your boost and shift abilities in different ways. Initially, you can only play Free for All in which up to six players face off in Trailblazer and Tag games. In Trailblazer, each player has to follow a DeLorean, which leaves a long yellow trail behind it as it moves. Driving in the path of the trail earns you points, but only one car at a time can catch the trail. This makes races a manic affair, as cars battle with each other using shift and boost to catch up to the DeLorean and ram competitors off the road.      In Tag, one car holds a tag trophy at the start of the race. Whoever holds the tag earns points, while the other cars have to ram that car to steal the tag. This cat-and-mouse system is a lot of fun, and with rapid shifting going on around you, any one of the AI-controlled cars on the road is a potential tag stealer. To unlock further modes, you have to earn experience points and level up, which is irritating if you just want to jump straight into something different. There are standard eight-player races that don't let you use boost or shift; takedown races, in which players take on the role of the police and chase down a getaway driver; and shift races, in which the first person to drive through a checkpoint gets the points. There are also cooperative team events, such as capture the flag and relay races.     The addition of shift to online races is excellent. Thankfully, you can't just spam the ability in races, with a gradually replenishing energy bar limiting the number you can make. If you'd rather take on a friend face-to-face, split-screen offers all the same modes. There are also additional co-op races like Clean the Streets, where you have to prevent marked vehicles from reaching their destinations, and a Freedrive mode, where you can kick back and enjoy a leisurely drive around the city. While on the whole these modes work well, there is a noticeable amount of slowdown when you enter heavy-traffic areas on freeways, which turns races into something of a slideshow.         While Driver: San Francisco is a lot of fun, it isn't without its faults: Missions can get a little repetitive toward the end (particularly if you're doing all the side missions), the storyline is ludicrous, and the less said about the incredibly frustrating final boss battle the better. These issues do little to sully what is a great driving game, though. A wealth of content, fast cars, and the inspired shift mechanic mean you're always kept in the thick of action-packed, over-the-top driving missions that are a thrill to play.    "
4783,Armorines: Project S.W.A.R.M.,3.0,0,"There's a reason why Acclaim has never brought Turok, its well-known first-person shooter series for the Nintendo 64, to the PlayStation. Why? Because the system doesn't handle the 3D world very well, and the company cares enough about the brand name of line not to malign it with a clearly substandard effort. However, that's not the case with Armorines, another of Acclaim's first-person shooter releases for the N64. On that console, the game is widely acknowledged to be ""all the things that you didn't like about Turok 2 and little of what you did."" On the PlayStation, it fares even worse.   What's it about? It seems that Acclaim must have noticed that Microprose had neglected to properly exploit its license for the giant bug-filled sci-fi film Starship Troopers for the console systems, because the inspiration behind Armorines is crystal clear. Though the title comes from a little-known Acclaim Comics property wherein the members of a military unit possess futuristic suits of armor along the lines of Marvel Comics' Iron Man, the alien race that you clash with in the game is totally dissimilar to the one found in the comic book. However, it does bear more than a passing resemblance to the swarm of creatures found in Paul Verhoeven's cinematic ode to fascism.    The inventive weapons, well-designed monsters, and challenging enemy AI found in Turok 2 are all missing here, and the only scripted events you'll come across are an onrush of monsters after you've opened a door or acquired an item. Remember the big levels in Turok 2 where you had to backtrack for half an hour just to find a key or kidnapped child? Do you recall how your enemies disappeared after they died so you didn't have a clear indication of whether you'd been in that area before? Don't have an N64 and haven't played it? Don't worry, both of those elements are well represented in Armorines, with a dash of poorly explained mission objectives tossed in for good measure. For example, in one of the Jungle missions, you're charged with destroying 34 alien eggs before they hatch. Expect to run around the level looking for all the batches for quite some time, all the while wondering how many you have remaining because the only indication of your progress is an open checkbox on your mission list (indicating you haven't completed the lot and likewise the mission). ""What do I do now?"" and ""Which way am I supposed to go?"" are questions that come up far too often in this game.    Elements that were bland and boring in the Nintendo 64 version are downright offensive here. But beyond the sparse environments, pathetic monster animations, and dismal soundtrack, the PlayStation port has a set of problems all its own. The game's control scheme is one of the worst you'll ever encounter. There are four configurations to choose from, all of them equally bad. In one, for instance, forward and back movements are assigned to the right shoulder buttons, the camera direction to the left directional buttons, and strafe to the square and circle buttons. And there's no analog support. It's true that the control scheme in Dreamworks' FPS game Medal of Honor took some time to get used to, but in Armorines it's the worst enemy you'll face. One of the game's few plusses is its two-player cooperative version of the main game. It's a nice gesture, at least, as the main game isn't very fun. A stripped-down no-frills two-player deathmatch is available as well, which is comparable to playing tag in an open field with blinders on.    There are so many problems with Armorines on the PlayStation that to discuss them all would be like flogging a dead horse. Simply put, it is not a good game. The quality level clocks in somewhere between Rainbow Six on the PlayStation and Superman on the Nintendo 64, two games whose names should be infamous enough for you to be able to put Armorines in its proper context."
2496,Pid,7.0,2,"   Limbo and Braid, Pid clearly desires recognition as art. You hear this impulse in the eclectic rhythms that punctuate Kurt's travels through labyrinthine attics and opera houses, and you see it in the robotic non-player characters that look like close cousins of Pablo Picasso's nameless metallic sculpture in Chicago. The world itself, drenched in an inviting soft focus, occasionally erupts into explosions of unexpected variety, whether it's in the scattered signs that impart both creepy and humorous messages, or the visage of a gigantic red balloon boss decked out in a crook's mask that takes potshots at Kurt.   Portal, save for limits on both duration and range. In the first few creative puzzles, the Beam hints at the possibility of future goodies to come. Tossing them on both horizontal and vertical surfaces, Kurt can use them to impale robots guards on the spikes that line the walls, floors, and ceilings he encounters; and he can use the beams to shift security cameras and transport himself over otherwise impassable gaps. In Pid's best moments, the concept achieves something like wonder, as when our boy hero has to use the beam to transport objects through a deadly maze.     Super Meat Boy (down to a tally of your total deaths during the credits), but the repetition of missile and laser obstacles and the tragic abundance of imprecise jumps and poorly placed platforms rob Pid of the same sense of achievement. The good news is that powerful hidden secondary items such as bombs and slingshots stave off the tedium, as do the constellations scattered throughout each level that act as currency for extra ammunition and a life vest that allows Kurt to take a few more hits.      Still, it doesn't help that Kurt's movements have a mildly ethereal, floaty quality that likely springs from Pid's interplanetary setting. Kurt's lazy hops may complement the dreamy mood and the precision required by some of the puzzles in the normal levels, but they interfere with the acrobatics demanded by the six lengthy boss fights and their overreliance on the beam mechanic. One battle demands that Kurt land on a tiny spot unless he wants to suffer the ordeal of enduring a barrage of deadly projectiles; another bids him to climb the shoulders of a boss while avoiding the missiles flying about.      Amid such chaos, even spending stars on a life vest seems foolhardy since Kurt may already have lost it by the time he starts to whittle down the bosses' excessively large health pools. Pid's local cooperative mode tempers these concerns to some degree, but it presents its own challenges by limiting each of the two onscreen Kurts to a single beam and forbidding players from dropping in or out.        Other minor issues mar the otherwise enjoyable experience, such as Pid's annoying tendency to start you at a faraway checkpoint after a reboot, which can discourage continued play if this issue pops up before one of the harder puzzles. The PC version in particular suffers from an awkward default control scheme that binds Kurt's movements to the directional keys, although a welcome option to change the keybinds allows for more intuitive setups. And perhaps worst of all, it's possible to forget that there's a charming story going on beyond the frustrations arising from Kurt's hundreds of deaths.      Kurt's trials partly arise from the traditional platforming challenge, of course, but trimming the more repetitive sequences and draining the bosses' health would have edged this effort toward the greatness enjoyed by some of its contemporary cousins. Even so, there are some rewarding levels in store for those with the patience to master Pid's quirks, and it's worth checking out for its art style alone. And with eight to 15 hours of gameplay followed by an even harder mode unlocked at the end, Pid justifies its price of admission.     "
4219,Hard Truck: Apocalypse,4.0,0,"  Hard Truck: Apocalypse proves that a fantastic name can only take a game so far, and without compelling content a game just isn't worth playing. It's an appealing concept: a role-playing game set in a postapocalyptic future where you have to drive heavily armored (and armed) trucks across a vast wasteland, delivering supplies, scavenging loot, and blasting gangs of bandits off the road. In execution though, Hard Truck: Apocalypse is about as exciting as counting the grains of sand in a postapocalyptic desert.         The game opens with a brief explanation of a cataclysmic event that led to the poisoning of the air, which killed off most of the planet's inhabitants. The prologue is by far the most interesting part of the story in the entire game, and it quickly degrades after the opening cinematic. You play the game as a young driver who just celebrated a birthday and is now officially a man. As such, you get a pep talk from your father, the keys to the family delivery truck, and your first mission to deliver some supplies to a nearby town. You head on down the road to get accustomed to life behind the wheel, and after a few scrapes with some local outlaws and some chance encounters with some mysterious characters, the adventure begins.     The gameplay in Hard Truck consists of driving from town to town across a large map and talking to people to accept missions and to get paid. The missions are mostly simplistic delivery tasks, escort missions, or extermination runs. Sometimes you'll have to deliver supplies to a distant town, blow up as many enemies as possible, or just travel from one town to the next and talk to the right person. There are a few mysteries to investigate and solve, but the majority of the missions are exceedingly dull.      There is no experience system in the game, so instead of leveling up your character, you simply get money that you can use to buy new and better parts for your truck. You can purchase new guns, new cargo boxes capable of holding more loot, more heavily armored cabs, or entirely new trucks. However, the upgrade system feels limited because there are only five different truck types, and they're all fairly similar save for slightly different stats for speed, armor, and fuel capacity. Most of the items are expensive too, so you'll have to complete dozens of dull missions before you can pick up that machine gun you've had your eye on.      You start off with a basic truck that isn't especially intimidating, but is certainly capable of getting from one point to another and blowing up a few enemies here and there. As you explore the vast, empty world you'll run into small packs of outlaws who will drive up to you and start shooting. The battles consist of driving around in circles using the WASD keys, and aiming your turret weapon with the mouse. Since the camera follows the turret, you'll just have to hope that you aren't driving off a cliff or into a tree as you're shooting your enemies. Of course, you can just stop and shoot, but you'll make yourself an easy target, and you'll miss out on all of the underwhelming action of vehicular combat.      Some of the enemies in the game are pretty tough, but only in the sense that they can take a lot of damage. The poison has apparently corroded the intelligence of people in this world, because you'll often see enemies run into trees and get stuck because they apparently don't know how to back up. Other times you'll get to see enemies drive right off of cliffs. It's not just the enemies that are stupid, as the allies are extremely dim as well. In some missions you'll have to escort allies from one town to another, and you can watch them drive right through fences, into trees, or just stop and wait while enemies open fire on them.      When you kill your enemies they'll usually drop some cargo, which you can pick up and use, or sell for more money. The money is important not only because it's required to upgrade your truck, but also because you'll often need to fork out a lot of cash for repairs and fuel for your rig. Fortunately there are enough gas stations and towns throughout the world that fuel and repairs are easy to come by, as long as you have enough money.      The world of Hard Truck: Apocalypse is actually fairly nice for being a supposed wasteland and all. There are green fields, smatterings of trees, large rivers, and quaint little farms. There are some areas that do look more appropriately barren, such as vacant, crumbling cities that you can check out. For the most part, though, the world is just a huge empty space that doesn't do much to encourage exploration. It doesn't help that your truck moves slowly, and with natural barriers like mountains and rivers to impede your progress, you'll often have to take lengthy detours to get where you want to go. Most of the towns look the same, and you don't even get to actually explore them because while you're in a town all of your interactions take place on menu screens.         The sound in Hard Truck is acceptable except for the voice acting. The conversations all sound awkward and unnatural, and there's not a single bit of enthusiasm or emotional inflection in any of the spoken dialogue. Even worse are the inane phrases that your driver will utter when enemies approach, like such catchy one-liners as, ""The roof is on fire!"" The music is actually decent, although it's still not good enough to make the experience of crawling across the country in a beat-up truck any more interesting.     Hard Truck: Apocalypse is a lifeless and boring game that lacks any sort of depth or excitement. If you're expecting an action-packed, Road Warrior-esque romp through a lawless desert wasteland, you won't find it here. Instead, you'll find yourself taking a trip down a long road that will have you asleep at the wheel.  "
3293,Gran Turismo 5,8.0,2,"      Although the used-car dealer invariably has dozens of cars in stock, your purchases are limited not only by your available funds, but also by your driver level, which starts out at zero. You earn experience points toward your next level every time you complete a challenge or race, and as you gain levels you unlock additional events as well as the option to buy more powerful cars. You might think that being prevented from buying the most powerful cars at the outset keeps those early events competitive, but as in previous games, it's all too easy to win most races simply by entering in a car that's significantly more powerful than the rest of the field. The 45 different race series that make up the A-Spec (drive yourself) and B-Spec (give instructions to an AI driver) portions of your career all place restrictions on the kinds of vehicles that can enter, but they're rarely stringent. The result is that you end up winning races easily, which, while rewarding financially, isn't particularly satisfying. Even race series that restrict you to using certain car models aren't competitive unless you go out of your way to make sure that they are, because there are no rules in place to prevent you from upgrading that car in the impressively comprehensive and easy-to-use tuning shop. On the flip side, it's also possible to unwittingly enter races in cars that are hopelessly underpowered, in which case you're likely to quit before you even finish the first lap.        Gran Turismo 5 is quick to punish you if you do something wrong, though you'll be dozens of hours into GT Life mode before the damage to your vehicles becomes anything more than superficial. A number of the game's driving aids (traction control and driving line, for example) are turned on by default, but while these certainly make staying on the track at speed much easier, they by no means guarantee that you're going to do well. These driving aids are nothing that hasn't been seen in racing games before, but what's especially great about Gran Turismo 5 is how scalable the assist options are. If you're a newcomer to simulation-style driving, you can augment the driving aids with a ""skid recovery force"" option that automatically gives your wheels extra grip anytime they start to slip. You still have to make some attempt to drive believably, because this option can cause understeer if you try to corner too quickly, but it's a huge help if you're finding the game too difficult, and there's no penalty for using it. If you're a veteran of simulation-style driving, on the other hand, you can turn all of GT5's aids off and enjoy a significantly more realistic and challenging drive with wholly believable vehicle handling and physics.       Top Gear test track and multistage rallies, to go-kart competitions and NASCAR challenges. Like the license tests, these challenges don't give you an opportunity to choose or customize your car, which makes them a far better test of your driving prowess than many events elsewhere in the game. Taking the twitchy controls of a kart makes for a welcome change of pace, though it's unfortunate that your AI opponents in this particular motorsport don't pose much of a challenge. Still, racing around in these diminutive open-wheelers is both a lot of fun and a great way to start honing your race craft on a level playing field. Similarly, the NASCAR challenges that are presented to you by an awkward-looking likeness of driver Jeff Gordon do a good job of preparing you for the oval races and NASCAR series of events that you unlock toward the end of your GT5 career. Other highlights in the special events include the AMG Driving Academy's wet weather time trials at the Nurburgring and Sebastien Loeb's fiendishly tricky rally challenges.      Outside of the GT Life mode, where you can participate only in events that both you and at least one of your cars are eligible for, you can set up custom events in Arcade mode that include both solo and two-player (with no AI opponents) split-screen races, time trials, and drift trials. There are more than 75 different tracks to choose from if you include those that can be raced at different times of day or in wet weather, though for some reason wet conditions are unavailable if you're playing split-screen. Regardless, it's a great selection, and after you've decided where you want to race, you're presented with an equally impressive array of vehicles to choose from. More than 50 premium cars spanning the game's entire garage are available for use in Arcade mode. In addition to those, you can nominate up to 100 of your GT Life cars as favorites so that they appear here, and you can import up to 50 cars from your Gran Turismo PSP garage as well. When racing in Arcade mode, you can set the difficulty level of your AI opponents to beginner, intermediate, or professional, though as in career events, tougher opponents don't necessarily equal smarter opponents; they're just faster.       To find smarter opponents, at least in theory, you need to head online. Gran Turismo 5 supports up to 16 players simultaneously without any noticeable lag, and it smartly deals with those who think it's hilarious to drive backward or to park their cars across the track by making them translucent and possible for others to pass through unscathed. Furthermore, as the host of an online session, you have numerous options with which to customize your races, including one that temporarily reduces power to the engines of anyone who collides with other racers or ends up riding rails around corners rather than slowing down for them. It's true that you might occasionally be penalized for minor and accidental collisions, but that's a small price to pay for encouraging everybody to race clean. As the host, you also get to decide which cars are permitted in races, and although you're free to let players use cars from their own garages, the more interesting option is to have everyone be allocated comparable cars at random, with an additional option to make sure that the winner of the previous race gets the slowest car.     It's a lot of fun to race online in Gran Turismo 5, and provided the host of the session you're playing in allows the use of driving aids, there's no reason you can't enjoy close contests with players of very different skill levels. You don't even need to race if you don't want to; in the online free run mode, a group of you can just drive laps of your chosen circuit as if you're at a track day, while the game keeps a note of who has recorded the fastest times. The only major weakness of GT5's online suite is that it's not nearly as easy as it should be to find sessions that you want to join.       There's no automatic matchmaking in GT5 whatsoever, so the only way to find a game assuming none of your friends are already playing is to pull up a list of lobbies that aren't already full, determine which of them offer the best connection speeds for you, and then hope that the lobby names typed in by the hosts give you a clear indication of what sorts of races they're running. Sadly, there's no good way to filter your search by, for example, the maximum power or level of the cars being used. The only search filters you get are the course being raced (which is likely to change after a race or two anyway), the region that the host is playing in (which defaults to your own), and whether the host has disallowed the use of the skid recovery force option (though not whether the host has chosen to allow it since your search options are ""off"" or ""all""). Furthermore, there's no easy way to invite friends into sessions that you're playing in or even hosting. Friends can join the game you're playing in by visiting your in-game profile, but there's no quick way for you to send them an invite that they can simply choose to accept. Each room is also assigned a unique 20-digit code that you can distribute to anyone who isn't on your friends list via forums and such, which is a functional if inelegant way to get people into your room, and a necessary evil given the lack of matchmaking.     When you're not behind the wheel or looking for online races, you might find that you spend a lot of time checking the used-car lot for rare or favorite vehicles. Among the 1,000-plus vehicles on GT5's roster are some real gems: one-of-a-kind prototypes, classic racecars, modern supercars, and all manner of historically relevant models from mainstream manufacturers. There are also an awful lot of vehicles that bring very little of worth to the game; for every car you ever contemplated putting a poster of on your wall as a kid, there are several that look more like something you were probably dropped off at school in. There's something to be said for the novelty of racing in a station wagon, or for trying to score points drifting in an underpowered antique, but there are a large number of cars in GT5 that aren't useful for a single event. And even if you get a kick out of trying to collect as many of the game's cars as possible, do you really want more than 25 variants of either Honda's S2000 or Mazda's MX-5?       You can try to ignore cars that you have no interest in, of course, just as you can do your best to drive only premium vehicles, but less desirable and standard rides are everywhere. Even if you avoid buying them when there's nothing else at the used-car lot, you end up racing against them. It's not just the standard cars that disappoint visually; many of the tracks in the game are also recognizable from earlier games, and while they clearly look a lot better in GT5, they're still not up to the standards being set elsewhere in the genre. Taking advantage of GT5's 3D functionality doesn't help matters either; not only does it add little to the experience and occasionally cause noticeable drops in the frame rate, but it's tricky to calibrate correctly because you don't get to see what effect your changes are having as you mess with the parallax and convergence settings. Just as they don't look as impressive as premium cars, many of the standard cars don't sound great, and when the soundtrack jarringly switches between forgettable rock and forgettable jazz, it's hard not to wonder if so much attention was paid to the premium cars during development that other aspects of the game were neglected.     Regardless, if you've ever fantasized about a Ferrari or dreamed of driving at Daytona, Gran Turismo 5 is a game that you're sure to get a lot out of. This is simultaneously the most accessible GT game yet and the most uncompromisingly realistic driving game on a console to date. It's unfortunate that much of what makes Gran Turismo 5 so great is under the hood rather than on display for everyone to see, but a powerful engine trumps a perfect paintjob every time.   "
2241,Flashback,4.0,0,"        Tron and Blade Runner, and all of that is beautifully reworked for modern systems. Gunplay is another highlight. The audio design gives weapons a solid, powerful oomph, and the ease with which you can pull out a weapon and take out some baddies reflects the altered focus of the design team.  Flashback is a tremendous disappointment, and a reminder that fond memories are often better left as just that: memories. The original game is included in emulated form with each copy of HD, but it's easier to appreciate for its influence on future games than it is to enjoy the act of playing it. Just skip this particular excursion into the past."
289,Rainbow Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan,8.0,2,"Final Fantasy Friendship. Suikoden Kindness. If you want a quick description of what Rainbow Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan is all about, those are a good start. While it's classified as a ""2.5D Adventure-Puzzle-Platformer"" on official marketplaces, Rainbow Billy is an RPG at its core, thanks to its team-building mechanics and a ""battle"" system worthy of those vaunted franchises. The exploration and platforming elements do add an air of adventure, but those moments aren't as smooth sailing thanks to some weird technical issues. The issues won't ruin the game though, as the entire experience is wrapped in a rainbow-colored warmth that's hard to describe. It has a constant ""glass half full"" attitude, playing out through dialogue between characters that mirrors a lot of real-world situations. The message alone makes the game worth checking out.You play as Rainbow Billy, a denizen of the World of Imagination. A massive water-faring dragon called Leviathan lays a terrible curse on the land, draining it of its color, and Billy must board his tugboat--named the Friend-Ship--and sail across multiple islands to solve puzzles, make new friends, and restore the world's vibrant colors. Joining Billy on the journey is Rodrigo, a sentient fishing rod-looking creature that helps Billy get around the world through swinging, gliding, and more. The main focus of the game--and the idea that sets Rainbow Billy apart--is its ""battle"" system. You'll see that words like ""battle"" and ""confront"" are in quotes throughout the review, and there's a reason: there's no ""battle"" to be had. Instead, Billy and the friends they recruit are attempting to restore the color in each black-and-white creature they ""confront,"" and they do it through dialogue and simple minigames.Here's how it works: You'll choose from recruited friends and place them on the battlefield in designated lanes, assigning one of three colored shapes to each friend. Once these ""battle lines"" are formed, minigames begin based on the lead creature in a lane. Some involve a slot machine-esque game where rainbow stars must stop on a line, others require button presses in a certain sequence. Upon winning a minigame, the colors then travel to the ""enemy,"" filling in any corresponding blank shapes above their heads. Enemies will fight back, depleting Billy's Morale meter, and an empty meter means a failed battle that must be restarted. Fill all the shapes in, however, and voila! A new friend is recruited.As the game progresses the confrontations get a little more involved, whether increasing the number of colors to fill in, adding more complicated minigames to complete, or adding unique parameters during a fight. One enemy, for example, worries about others being more ""perfect"" than they are, so any time you complete a minigame with no mistakes, they negate all of the colors immediately. The wrenches thrown into the battle system keep an already unique mechanic from growing stale, giving every instance its own spin and making the entire game better in the process.The creature being worried about how others view them actually speaks to a core tenet of the Rainbow Billy experience. Every single one of the 60 creatures that you'll find is feeling some sort of anxiety, causing their loss of color. One rodent-esque creature doesn't want others focusing on their giant front teeth. Another acknowledges that they snack too much, even if the snacks are healthy. A third is a champion boxer coming to terms with the end of their career and the need to pass the baton.Every one of these stories feels real, rooted in real-world feelings that are absolutely relatable to most players. These new friends are telling tales of anxiety over identity, having trouble making friends, and being bullied, all very prevalent real-world issues. Granted you may not relate to all 60 of them, but there's definitely one or two that will make you think, ""huh, I've felt that before."" The game then follows up with talking through the issues, working on them, and once color is restored, acknowledging the character's personal flaw and moving past it. It's wonderful, inspiring stuff that could genuinely be helpful to some people, all found in a cute rainbow-tinged adventure.This idea isn't limited to the battle system either, as each of the 60 characters can increase in power--and gain more colors to use in confrontations--by fulfilling their requests. Items found while traveling the world--ranging from a teddy bear to video games to art supplies--are requested by the creatures, and giving a creature the item they desire further explores the roots of their flaws. Their colors are already restored, sure, but they're still working through what made them lose their colors in the first place. These sometimes use similar elements--a lot of these animals reference school-based trauma, for instance--but the situations they describe are very much based in the human experience.Take Alpharoar, one of the first friends you'll meet. Alpharoar is super protective of his little brother Bark, so much so that he also got expelled from his school once for going overboard defending Bark from a bully and getting into a fight. Through his dialogue, he realizes that overdoing it could have gotten him separated from the family he's trying to protect, thus leaving his sibling vulnerable to bullies in Alpharoar's absence. He understands the need to tone things down, giving him more understanding of why what he was doing is wrong. This is just one example of the 60 stories you'll be told, and all of them are as heartwarming and as real as this one.Billy's past that will be explored throughout the adventure, culminating in Billy dealing with some difficult topics head-on. Like the others, this story is told with respect and realism, never straying too far into the cartoonish despite the cartoon it's set inThese mini-stories all set up the overarching tale of Billy themselves, who is dealing with heavy trauma of their own. Avoiding spoilers, there's a lot in Billy's past that will be explored throughout the adventure, culminating in Billy dealing with some difficult topics head-on. Like the others, this story is told with respect and realism, never straying too far into the cartoonish despite the cartoon it's set in. It's a remarkable experience that will leave a lasting impression on a lot of people.Outside of ""battle"" the basic gameplay loop establishes itself early: You pull up to a dock in the Friend-Ship, do a bit of platforming or puzzle-solving before meeting a creature, ""confront"" the creature to restore its color, and move on to the next island. Some islands have more gimmicks than others--from having multiple creatures to confront, to needing multiple visits to complete--but otherwise, this is the gist of the game. It's repetitive, but you never feel that repetition weighing on you. The game does a good job of giving each island its own unique properties and making them feel like individual experiences.That said, traversing the islands tends to be frustrating. Billy has a major problem with ledges and cliffs. Walk too close before jumping and Billy gets stuck, requiring some maneuvering to get unstuck and try again. Sometimes Billy will stick to an edge during a jump, sending them into the water instead of up in the air. A few island layouts create some confusion during traversal too, putting an obstacle further out of reach than it appears and causing some unintended drops off of a ledge. Luckily, there are no ""lives"" in Rainbow Billy, meaning there are no repercussions for a trial-and-error platforming approach. If at first you don't succeed, you can try and try again.This lack of consequences also applies to the puzzles, which are simple brain teasers involving pushing snowballs or aiming beams of light. Sometimes a single button press is all you need to complete a puzzle, making sure that the item you're pushing is heading in the right direction. You may consider the bulk of these puzzles too simple--a few can be solved by pressing switches in a natural order with little thought--but honestly, that's the whole point. Rainbow Billy is billed as, among other things, a highly accessible experience. The game puts no pressure on you to succeed on your first, second, or even third try at a puzzle, knowing you can just flip a switch and start again. That lack of pressure is freeing in a sense, letting you experiment without having to worry about, well, anything.As the world expands, the Friend-Ship's abilities will as well, thanks to the game's main collectible: Thoughts. These tiny grey creatures dot the world, and collecting them lets you upgrade the ship by chatting with the computer inside. Some upgrades don't add much--hooray for Photo Mode filters?--but things like having more turns in ""battle"" or more creatures to choose from during a turn are crucial to victory later in the game. The best part of the Thoughts are the tiny bits of personality they're given in the in-game menu; each one having a small message like ""is a hot dog a sandwich"" or ""If it's called a waterfall, does that mean its opposite is a firefly?"" These silly jokes, much like the rest of the game, will put a smile on your face.Honestly, the best way to summarize Rainbow Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan was performed by Cyndi Lauper 35 years ago. This is a game about showing one's ""true colors"" to the world, teaching that being oneself is the best way to approach all aspects of life. Its messages of love, friendship and self-discovery are inspiring, the sort of Ted Lasso-esque positivity the world could use a lot more of right now. The package delivering the message doesn't always impress, especially with its platforming, but the unique battle system and rewarding exploration pick up the slack.Rainbow Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan is the role-playing game equivalent of a warm hug from a good friend, and sometimes all you need is love."
511,SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated,2.0,0,"SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated is rarely amusing or challenging, and completing it is an entirely dry experience. It looks nice, and brings back fond memories of a classic cartoon through iconic set pieces and tight voice acting, but its uncomfortable and outdated mechanics make you feel frustratingly trapped and are ultimately outclassed by countless other modern and classic platformers.SpongeBob is a show built on rapid-fire humour and good pacing, but this game misses that mark. The game is a remake of the 2003 cult classic 3D collect-a-thon platformer of the same name. There were three versions of the original: a 2D platformer, a 3D platformer, and one full of minigames. This version took me around 20 hours to play through the main story and get a bunch of bonus collectibles, and from the movement to the jokes, the whole thing feels slow, with none of the comedic timing that makes the show so beloved.It starts off when Plankton accidentally creates an army of uncontrollable robots that you have to defeat as a rotation of familiar faces: SpongeBob SquarePants, Patrick Star, and Sandy Cheeks. The main menu is a hub world where you can select stages based on notable SpongeBob locations like the Flying Dutchman's Graveyard, Jellyfish Fields, and Goo Lagoon. Your main objective is collecting Golden Spatulas. They're littered around the world and are used to unlock stages. You can also find Shiny Objects and Socks which can be spent to buy spatulas from Mr. Krabs or Patrick respectively.Diving into the game is exciting at the beginning. The Greater Bikini Bottom Area is carefully re-imagined into a clean, revitalized style that’s popping with a new paint job. It looks glossy, but you have to wonder how necessary the whole visual update is when the original doesn’t even look bad. It’s got the same voice track as the original, with almost all of the voice actors from the show picking up their roles for the game, directing you around to various objectives and making short conversation. You can tell the voice actors are trying hard to carry the experience, but they can’t do that because they're only given a few canned lines that repeat over and over again outside of the cutscenes. In a sense, Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated functions as a SpongeBob museum, highlighting the environments that give life to the series. There’s a keen attention to detail in recreating the original's charm, which is done well, but this underwater world's allure falls flat without quality-of-life updates that consider how differently we play today.After the first few areas, exploring quickly becomes a chore. Some spatulas are thrown at you for doing nothing, and others feel impossible to get due to bad camera angles and unexplained systems that you’re somehow expected to know. Luckily there are a ton of helpful existing forum posts and walkthroughs for the OG game that can guide you through the most annoying parts. But that lack of consideration given to the spatula’s locations is off-putting and causes the game to start dragging within the first few hours.Movement is just as unpleasant. It’s a constant wrestling match with mechanics that are both restrictive and awkward to a point that they remove your focus from the current objective and makes you want to put the controller down. Moving platforms are slow, and you have to jump on them often. If you miss them you end up bored, sitting there, waiting for the platform again while looking at an idle animation for too long and listening to the same short music loop on repeat. Even if you like the Stephen Hillenburg bangers, this gets annoying fast. Once you ace a moving platform’s weird rhythms, it doesn't mean it's over. Sometimes there are robots placed right at the end of those sequences that are too large for your character to move around properly because of their lack of mobility. It just feels cruel. It feels like your only options are to have SpongeBob try to jump to a place out of bounds and get escorted back to the stage by the giant floating hand named ""Hans,"" or fall to the start....this underwater world's allure falls flat without quality of life updates that consider how differently we play today.There were multiple points in the game where I climbed up to the top of a high structure and a rogue robot knocked me all the way down into water. Ironically, none of the protagonists can swim, so I instantly died and respawned at a checkpoint. Having to start all over is truly deflating. I’m willing to learn how to excel with a game’s controls even if they're difficult to grasp at the start, but with Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated, it isn’t a matter of understanding the controls and abilities--it's a case of the controls just not working well. It's fine for games to punish players for being bad, but this game just feels constantly punishing for no reason, and it doesn’t seem to notice it or acknowledge it. Sometimes there are different ways to get to golden spatulas, but the game also randomly blocks paths with invisible walls, rendering your attempt to get there useless and telling you that your solution isn’t right. Walking into those walls feels like a slap in the face just for thinking creatively.The levels revolve around walking to recurring characters around the map, picking up tasks from them, fighting robots, and swapping between two characters to utilize their strengths and complete the area. The loop could be enjoyable, but you can’t run in this game. Or dodge. Or swap characters conveniently. It's grueling. You have to walk around slowly, fight almost every robot in your path (some areas are way too packed with enemies), and frequently move back and forth to Bus Stops that are out of the way 90% of the time for character swaps. The protagonists all have distinct play styles that grant you access to different parts of the maps--if SpongeBob can't jump there, then run over to a Bus Stop so you can swap characters to Sandy and Lasso Glide over. But if you die, good luck keeping your cool. Deaths can feel beyond unfair, restarting your progress to the point that you may end up looking into the dark depths of the loading screen abyss thinking, ""Why? Why me?""The fleeting fun I had during this game happened during the boss fights. They wake you up out of autopilot mode by transforming the game’s monotonous motions into something that demands your attention. Your colossal foes and the tricks up their sleeves cause you to start thinking about your movements carefully. The cutscenes before the start of the fights are genuinely funny, backed by an intense synth tune, and each battle is commentated live by a talking fish. These moments are a bright light in the game and make it feel alive, just for a moment. It’s a delight to have the game make you laugh at these points, because most of the other jokes in the game just don’t hit.If you find you still have fond feelings about the original SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom, you should watch a speedrun of it or find your old copy and dust off that PS2. This one isn't it. Remasters, ports, and remakes are nice because they make games more accessible to new audiences, and the ones that excel understand that some features from the game's era are antiquated and should be updated or removed. SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated flops like a fish out of water when it comes to this. It’s a game so focused on emulating and embellishing the original that it doesn’t know the parts of itself that are fun and the parts that aren't. It lost sight of the basic elements that make a collectible platformer enjoyable. This game doesn’t promote curious or keen gameplay, the movement isn't smooth, and gathering collectibles never feels rewarding. Ultimately, the game winds up being an unpleasant nostalgia trip that nobody should pack their bags for."
3531,Tropico 3,8.0,2," Live and Let Die. Personality traits, backgrounds, and new costumes have also been added, so you can play as a guy with a green thumb, installed in power by the mob, who likes wearing a fat Elvis jumpsuit. Or not.        Not quite so brand-new is the 10-mission new campaign. It sees you island-hopping from one Caribbean dictatorship to another, just like in the original game, but the objectives are now more outlandish. Whereas the old scenarios dealt with mostly down-to-earth goals, such as increasing farm production, making a killing off oil, and so forth, here you do zanier things, such as rig an island for anti-industry hippies, make peasants believe in the existence of chupacabra, deal with a rift in time and space, and even look into unsolved mysteries by setting up a secret police unit called the Alpha Files. These out-there goals are tempered in that they lean on the same city-building/political mechanics that have always been at the heart of the Tropico games, although they do provide a more involving story to each mission. Everything you do is more purposeful now, instead of feeling vague like many of the original game's scenarios.     Even though you might be dealing with Rastafarians and maybe even aliens in Absolute Power, you continue to focus on keeping the treasury flush and the citizens happy through building farms, factories, churches, police stations, and casinos and messing about with politics as in any other Tropico game. But things have been spiced up with more options across the board. A new political faction called the Loyalists has been added to the old mix of Capitalists, Communists, Militarists, and their other pals. They're not particularly loyal, though, unless you do things that inevitably offend almost everybody else, like building a museum to your greatness and canceling elections. Factions are easier to manage, because lists of major and minor needs are now included in the interface to keep you from guessing what you need to build to make a particular group happy. The whole interface is actually improved where information is concerned, giving you more little hints like the above and keeping you in the know about even little matters, such as how many months until the next farm harvest.     New buildings have been tossed into the mix, adding options and fixing minor flaws in the original game. Garages have been shrunk so they're easier to place. Generating electricity is possible with cheap wind turbines, so you can get the juice flowing early in missions without spending huge bucks on a power plant. Grade schools boost intelligence and can be used to indoctrinate kiddos into the Loyalist faction. A pricey nuclear program can fend off circling US and USSR warships. You can try to please environmentalists by constructing garbage dumps that come with recycling options. A satellite dish lets you hunt for aliens and spy on the superpowers. Entertainment and tourism have been revamped with Ferris wheels, marinas, and balloon rides over monuments like ancient pyramids. Giant monuments can be used to satisfy your ego. If you've got the cash, you can build a towering Eternal Flame to awe people into respecting the dear leader, a massive Christ statue like the one that towers above Rio to endear yourself to the religious faction, or even a huge golden statue of yourself, a la Nero, to please the Loyalists. Industry hasn't been altered much, although you can make a few bucks by processing metal into military hardware in the new weapons factory. These aren't huge changes, though they open up scenarios in many subtle ways. You'll soon wonder how you ever managed without them.        Ten extra edicts have been introduced for you to unleash on those poor, unsuspecting peasants. Like the above, there isn't anything here that could be considered earthshaking. But it's good to have additional options to lean on when clinging to power or trying to goose citizen happiness up a few percentage points. Outlaw Faction is helpful when you need to take a group completely out of the picture and have a strong army ready to handle the inevitable outpouring of support for the rebels. Print Money gives you $20,000 immediately at the cost of a huge inflation hit, but this can come in handy when you're in need of cash to close out a scenario win and don't care about the long term. Clicking on National Day earns cheap respect and blasts off fireworks over the island once a year. Kill Juanito not only shuts up the loudmouthed deejay, but it eliminates rebel attacks for a full three years. That's handy when you're sorting out the army and worried about an uprising. In the same vein, Lure Rebels starts a battle with the revolting populace right away, so you can fight at a time of your own choosing.     Absolute Power keeps the Tropico 3 party going. Nothing revolutionary can be found here when it comes to game design, but all the offbeat new islands, new buildings, and other extras do a great job of extending and improving the core experience. There is also a ton of content in the lengthy campaign scenarios, which should occupy virtual dictators for at least 20 hours--which isn't entirely positive, as this running time exposes the lack of new music and the tiny smattering of new radio prattle from a whiny revolutionary named Betty Boom. Still, even with the repetitive tunes and dialogue, consider this expansion a must for anybody who enjoyed the original game's take on tropical tyranny.  "
2036,South Park: The Stick of Truth,7.0,2,"Let's get super cereal, shall we? South Park: The Stick of Truth is the closest there is to an interactive South Park film. It nails the animated television show's look, its humor, and its obsession with the human anus. If you come to The Stick of Truth for the South Park-ness of it all--for Cartman's aggressive profanity, for Butters' good intentions, for Randy Marsh's masturbation addiction--then you'll enjoy 10 or so hours of hysterical, offensive, gross buffoonery. Does the phrase ""anal beads"" make you giggle? Have you daydreamed of tossing poop at the people you hate? Then you know where you can shove The Stick of Truth: right into your console's disc drive. South Park, 10 or 11 hours of listening to Cartman call you a douchebag could prove tiring. Nevertheless, given developer Obsidian Entertainment's pedigree, you would rightfully expect a certain amount of systemic depth, or perhaps an epic-length quest loaded with narrative choices. As role-playing games go, however, The Stick of Truth is notably light on, well, everything. It's light on challenge: on medium difficulty, combat is a cakewalk, entertaining to watch but rarely engaging your mental faculties. (If you were hoping to turn your brain off and laugh at abortion jokes, you might see this as a mark in the game's favor.) It's also light on depth: if it weren't for the profanity, cartoon genitalia, and the sight of a grown man engaged in gentle coitus with a farm animal, you might have retitled The Stick of Truth as Baby's First RPG. As for choice, the game asks you to make very few narrative decisions, and the one that most obviously masquerades as a game-changing opportunity is quickly thrown away and rendered moot.   A deep role-playing experience this is not. It is fun, however, in an ""I just farted on a Nazi zombie fetus"" kind of way. The overarching plot tying events together is paper-thin, putting you in the role of the new kid in town and inviting you to make friends with the potty-mouthed residents of South Park, Colorado. And Jesus. You can think of yourself as the Gordon Freeman of your social group: you're a silent protagonist upon whom the fate of the fabled Stick of Truth rests, and you become well regarded for the incredible rate at which you add buddies to Facebook. There's a mystery plot involving Taco Bell, an alien invasion, and yadda yadda yadda, but that's all beside the point: The Stick of Truth's story is a joke-delivery mechanism, leading you through many of the game's running gags by way of Kyle and company's high-fantasy hijinks. Does the phrase ""anal beads"" make you giggle? Have you daydreamed of tossing poop at the people you hate? Jackass, or The Jerry Springer Show. And so you hobble about the town as a customizable cardboard cutout--meaning that you fit right in among the rabble-rousing youngsters. Most of your exploration comes after you've chosen one of four character classes: fighter, mage, thief, or...Jew. Your choice determines your special abilities in the game's turn-based battles; in my case, I could fling stones at enemies using the sling of David, and use circum-scythe to inflict bleeding damage to my foes', er, groinal regions. (There's no mention of whether the skill accounts for the victim's adjusted penis size when you attack.) Don't get too hung up on your choice of class, however. While you are assigned default gear and occasionally earn new class-specific gear at specified story points, you can wear any armor and wield any weapon you find or purchase. You can further customize your weapons with strap-ons (say, a Jew-pacabra claw for your alien ray gun that reduces your enemy's armor upon a perfect attack) and armor with patches (say, a brown badge of courage for your crown of thorns that enhances your health). Again, however, you needn't give this system much thought: just equip the highest-level gear you can, add whatever strap-ons and patches most appeal to you, and all is fine. The cash pours in quickly, and there are so many recovery items like health potions (Snacky Cakes and such) and mana potions (Hot Pockets and the like) scattered around that you run out of room for these items faster than you can use them. In fact, The Stick of Truth is so easy that you will likely forget you've even collected some of these objects. You can throw water balloons at your enemies to remove their buffs, and you can quaff some Tweek Bros Coffee to gain another turn, but the chances of needing them are practically nil. There's no reason, then, not to spend freely on wigs, glasses, and other accoutrements. After all, nothing says ""professional Jew"" like a blond Lolita wig, 3D glasses, and muttonchops. The most valuable combat items aren't the most effective, but rather the most entertaining to unleash. I used every toilet I came across in The Stick of Truth, because doing so yielded feces I could fling in combat to gross out the hobos and hall monitors I was fighting. I could have used those turns for more effective attacks, perhaps, but watching bullies barf every turn was too fun of a possibility to pass up. Your choice of which buddy to invite into battle with you is similarly balanced in favor of fun over effectiveness. Only one other character can be in your party at any one time (Butters, Cartman, and Jimmy are among the choices), and while your buddies all have different skills, there's no real advantage in choosing one over another. In fact, apart from the moments the game forces a particular party member upon you, you could easily stick with a single buddy from beginning to end. The mechanics of those battles are utterly simplistic: the two teams take turns beating each other up until the bad guys are defeated. There are some peripheral considerations like power points (aka PP, aka peepee) and mana, but there's not a lot to them. There are two major reasons to stay fully conscious during combat. Firstly, battles capture the essence of the show and the essence of each character. It's almost impossible not to adore the ever-sweet Butters when he heals you by patting you on the back and giving you a little pep talk. And I dare you to suppress your guffaws when Jimmy takes the stage, stuttering out a madrigal that rhymes ""hollow"" with ""swallow"" before dropping the mic. Secondly, almost every attack requires some kind of interaction--sometimes in the form of a well-timed button tap, sometimes in the form of a twirl of the thumbstick, and sometimes in the form of a Dance Dance Revolution-type minigame. (PC players: plug in an Xbox 360 controller. Doing so will save you the frustration of discovering the many keyboard-unfriendly ways in which this is a console game through and through.) Battles might be easy, but at least they keep your fingers occupied, if not your brain. A deep role-playing experience this is not. Some skills allow you to avoid combat entirely, though these opportunities are heavily scripted, so don't go thinking you'll suddenly have a wealth of new choices when you unlock new fart attacks. I admit to cracking a smile every time I burnt an enemy to a crisp by farting onto a nearby open flame, but few such scenarios exhibited mechanical cleverness, so I never felt particularly smart for taking advantage of the possibility. Indeed, if you were to remove the license, The Stick of Truth's shallowness would be achingly apparent, with a journey to the great nation of Canada standing out as the game's shrewdest scenario. But The Stick of Truth cannot be separated from its license, and it's in its vulgar attitude that it finds redemption. On your Facebook wall, which functions as your in-game menu system, Priest Maxi writes: ""I'm glad you found Christ, my son. Be ever vigilant, for He may be found in the unlikeliest of places in the time of need. I found Him in my chimney once."" South Park: The Stick of Truth is not the second coming of role-playing games, so if you come seeking Jesus, you'll be disappointed by the veritable second-rate televangelist you find in His place. But it's as funny as the merry tune of Stratford, and more enjoyable than Butters' favorite game, Hello Kitty: Island Adventure."
3356,EA Sports MMA,8.0,2,"   Fight Night Round 4. You move with the left analog stick and throw punches with the right, and the shoulder buttons are used to modify those controls to target the body rather than the head, to throw kicks or fakes instead of punches, and to block. Face buttons are used for clinches, sprawls, takedowns, submissions, and ground position changes. The choke submission system involves rotating the right stick in search of a sweet spot and takes some getting used to, but like the rest of the default controls, it works well. There's an option to play with a completely different controller setup that uses face buttons for punches and kicks, but it doesn't afford you the same level of control, and because you'll almost certainly want to use the superior default controls at some point, it's not recommended. Even if you're not familiar with the controls in recent Fight Night games, there's an MMA 101 option accessible from EA Sports MMA's main menu that does an excellent job of teaching you the basics, and there are also ample opportunities to familiarize yourself with the stand-up, clinch, and ground controls when you start out in Career mode.     Depending on how narcissistic you are, you might be disappointed with the level of customization that's available when you create your career fighter. There's support for EA Sports' Game Face technology, but regardless of whether you use your console's camera or photos uploaded to the EA website to put yourself in the game, the results are disappointing. Furthermore, there are no options to manually tweak the physical properties of heads and faces in the game; if you don't use Game Face, you're limited to choosing one of around 50 premade heads. You can play around with different hairstyles, eye colors, skin tones, and tattoos, but even these options are limited compared to those offered in other EA Sports games. Licensed clothing options, on the other hand, are excessive, and picking out a shirt from the 245 that are available is hardly worth the effort given that your fighter only wears a shirt briefly before or after fights. Scrolling through 160 different pairs of shorts isn't much fun either, especially when you're prompted to choose not only a primary pair, but also an alternate pair that--even when you're matched up with an opponent wearing identical gear--never comes into play.       While creating your Career mode fighter you're also prompted to choose one of nine different specializations, all of which have key strengths and weaknesses. Play as a boxer, for example, and your kicks aren't nearly as effective as your punches. Specialize in judo, on the other hand, and your takedowns and ground skills are much more useful than your striking, and you have a glass jaw to boot. You can train in other styles by visiting different gyms once your career gets under way, but a kickboxer is never going to be great at submissions, and a sambo practitioner isn't likely to win many fights with powerful kicks. Once you settle on your look, your fighting style, and on the name that announcers will call you, you get to meet your trainer, retired MMA champion Bas Rutten.     After training with Bas and turning pro, the first thing you need to do is decide which of two fictional leagues you want to start your career in. EA Sports MMA features six different leagues, including the Strikeforce league that many of the game's licensed fighters compete in. The rules vary somewhat depending on which leagues you choose to fight in, but regardless of whether or not elbows and knees are allowed on the ground, the action plays out in much the same way. The most interesting fights tend to be those that pit two different fighters against each other, because then the two of you have very different agendas and force each other to adapt. Wrestlers want to take the fight to the ground at every opportunity, while Muay Thai guys stop at nothing to get their opponent into a clinch, for example. You can defend against both with a single well-timed button press, and blocking incoming strikes is just as easy. The ease with which you can defend, coupled with your fighter's finite amount of stamina, means that going on an all-out offensive is rarely a good idea, at least not against a skilled opponent. Sadly, there aren't a lot of those to be found in Career mode.       If you play Career mode on the default difficulty setting (there are two more-difficult options that improve things somewhat), the AI opponents don't always put up much of a fight, particularly early on. You can win fights simply by spamming jabs over and over again or, later on, by stacking your opponent and hitting him in the gut for minutes at a time while he pointlessly protects his face. It's not a satisfying way to win a fight, and it's unfortunate that you might spend far less time fighting than you do training early on, but things do improve as your career progresses. Regardless of where you are in your career, you're forced to spend eight weeks training in between fights. Most of the weekly training challenges take under a minute to complete and do a great job of forcing you to use different moves while simultaneously beefing up your fighter's stats. To improve your movement and range, you might be asked to survive for 60 seconds in a fight without the option to block or strike back, for example. Some of the training challenges can be completed very cheaply (at least one instance of the aforementioned example can be aced by circling an opponent who does nothing but try to circle you at the same time), but most pose a reasonable challenge and, appropriately, get easier as your stats improve.      One of the best things about the training in EA Sports MMA is that after completing a challenge, you gain the option to just push a button and simulate it anytime you want to reap its benefits. You're graded when training, so simulating a challenge that you scored only a D on isn't as effective as simulating one that you scored an A on, but it's great that once you get that A there's no reason to do the same thing over and over again. Another neat feature of the Career mode is that after getting your first few fights out of the way, you can travel to different gyms and complete challenges to learn new moves. You can learn one additional move before each fight, and although there are more than 25 moves available, you're limited to 16, so figuring out which moves to learn and when adds a welcome element of strategy to the proceedings.       The action inside the ring (or cage) also demands strategic thinking once the difficulty ramps up, particularly when you fight against human opposition locally or online. Not only must you always be aware of your stamina--which appears onscreen by default but can be turned off--but you also need to figure out your opponent's strengths and weaknesses and adjust your game plan accordingly. It's extremely satisfying to finish an opponent after taking a beating from him for the first several minutes of a fight, and by the same token, it's frustrating to suddenly lose against an opponent that you've been dominating. These changes of fortune rarely feel unrealistic, though, and the fact that they're quite common prevents you from becoming either complacent or completely disheartened during a fight. There might be times when your stamina is all gone and you feel helpless as your opponent forces you up against the cage, or when you seem unable to escape a string of submission attempts, but there's almost always a way out, and there's always a way to avoid finding yourself in that situation in the first place.     Sadly, if you choose to play EA Sports MMA with the stamina bar and the health indicators for head, torso, and legs turned off, it can be overly difficult to get a feel for how well you're doing. Punches and kicks don't always feel like they have much power behind them, and the use of realistic-looking blood is limited and, since it's possible to be dominating a fight and still look worse than your opponent, can be misleading. Another problem inside the ring is that often when fighters launch attacks simultaneously, they inexplicably manage to avoid making any contact with each other, instead anticlimactically returning to their original stances.     Unsurprisingly, the most satisfying fights are found online, where opponents are far less predictable than the AI. Players are already gravitating toward powerful fighters like Fedor Emelianenko and Randy Couture, but if you're good and you know how to play to your chosen fighter's strengths (which won't be a problem if you choose to use your Career mode fighter), nobody is unbeatable. Online play doesn't suffer from any noticeable lag, and it benefits from a number of options that go beyond the usual ranked matches and leaderboards. Every time you fight, you earn points toward new rankings and different-colored belts; you can create custom fight cards for groups of up to 10 players who watch and comment on each other's fights while waiting their turn; and there are regular leaderboard-based tournaments that culminate in live broadcast finals. Fights that appear during live broadcasts are commentated live by MMA experts and can be watched by anyone not participating either through the game or on the official EA Sports MMA website. This is a great feature that, even if you don't get to appear in one of the fights yourself, makes you feel like you're a part of something big.       Even outside of live broadcasts, EA Sports MMA does a good job of replicating the look and feel of a pay-per-view event. Great-looking fighters enter arenas accompanied by their chosen entrance music; the commentators do a solid if repetitious job of calling the action; and the crowd noise swells up at all the right moments. The ring announcer's lip-synching could use some work, and the camera occasionally appears to be torn between two locations and so sways frantically between both of them, but these are minor complaints. If you have even a passing interest in mixed martial arts, EA Sports MMA is unlikely to disappoint. The Career mode offers a lengthy and ultimately very rewarding challenge that you'll probably want to play through at least twice using different fighting styles, and both local and online multiplayer matches are a lot of fun. It's unfortunate that the AI isn't more convincing and that lengthy load times permeate every aspect of the game, but EA Sports MMA is deserving of a spot alongside UFC Undisputed 2010 in your collection even if it can't yet replace it.   "
3927,Mind Quiz,5.0,1,"  Mind Quiz: Your Brain Coach is a shameless clone of Nintendo's brain-training DS game, Brain Age. Like that game, it offers tests that use shaky-looking science to determine how ""old"" your brain feels, along with various minigames designed to give your brain a bit of a workout. Mind Quiz has some similar tests to Nintendo's game and essentially comes off feeling like a cheap knockoff.        The main part of Mind Quiz is the mind quiz itself, which is broken into a brain stress degree test and a brain age test. Both tests place items on the screen that you need to tap in the correct order. One test has you alternate between letters and numbers, while the other test is just numbers. The game keeps track of your score in these tests over time, showing you if you've been improving or slipping. The training section is broken into a few different sections and offers different minigames, including slide puzzles, a voice-recognition test that showcases the game's truly awful voice recognition, a shooterlike game where you have to tap dogs as they run across the screen or throw bones at a running man, and so on. Whether they improve your mind or not is questionable, but what's more certain is that most of these training games aren't much fun. They're all very simple exercises without any real variety or major challenge, unless you can get excited about competing with your high scores.     Visually, the game is plain looking thanks to the basic nature of the various tasks you'll complete. But there is a cohesive visual theme to the different games that usually revolves around a dog and a man with a rainbow where his brain should be, which is utter madness. The sound effects are lackluster and feel as if they were thrown in as an afterthought. Each game ends with a woman proclaiming ""this is the end"" in the most monotone voice possible, making her sound as if she's just about to snap and slit her own throat.     This game isn't good enough to serve as a game for Brain Age players who are looking for more of the same because it's too similar yet too shallow to entertain that crowd. If you fall into the group of people who haven't played Brain Age, you should go with that one rather than waste your time on a pretender like Mind Quiz.  "
3066,Hunted: The Demon's Forge,5.0,1,"Gears of War and co-opted by countless games since. It's a shame that a game with such promise feels so unfinished. Imagine this scenario: you take up your bow, and a buddy grabs his mace and shield. Together, you cut through swaths of maniacal monsters, seeking the most effective ways of ridding your fantasy kingdom of a rising menace. When Hunted comes together, it captures the essence of such a rambunctious adventure. But sloppy locomotion, technical glitches galore, and all sorts of basic flaws rise up to smite you. PC players also get a special problem to call their own: barely functioning online play. And that's a damning issue in a game designed to be played with another.        In spite of its numerous foibles, Hunted: The Demon's Forge isn't devoid of fun, and it boasts a great concept: combine the best parts of fantasy hack-and-slash adventures and Gears-style cover shooting, and then throw in some loot. One player assumes the role of Caddoc, a bald-headed melee specialist. The other takes over the ample assets of E'lara, an archer with impossible curves and no desire to shield her backside from swords, arrows, or the stares of lascivious passersby. Together, you move through dungeons, flaming villages, and more dungeons, slicing away at the titular demons while occasionally casting spells, grabbing loot, and trading barbs about who killed the most meanies in that last battle. Caddoc and E'lara are in it for the cash and are hardly heroes worth remembering once your eight hours with Hunted's campaign come to a close. Yet they share an easygoing camaraderie that's appealing, if wholly unexplored.     Hunted's good aspects follow from that mishmash of gameplay elements. Both characters wield melee and ranged weapons, but E'lara is best when shooting from afar while Caddoc wades into the fray. When you're wielding a bow, Hunted plays like a cover shooter: you crouch behind a low barrier or press your back against a wall, lean out, and fire. With sword or axe in hand, you swing away at a limited variety of snarling savages, rolling and blocking when necessary. As either character, you cast spells that work well in tandem with your partner. E'lara freezes enemies, and Caddoc smashes them to pieces. Caddoc lifts monsters into the air and slams them into the ground, while E'lara fills them with arrows. Two brands of action plus varied magical skills make for some fun battles. That diversity goes a long way toward veiling just how linear Hunted's levels are, how mundane its infrequent puzzles are, and how few enemy types there are.    lot of Hunted. This is a disappointing restriction in which the reward doesn't match the effort. And while you can allow others into your private realm, there is no way to share your creations or download others to explore at your own leisure.        You stumble upon plenty of random equipment on your adventure, though looting isn't Hunted's best feature. You find equipment on the ground or smash weapon racks, but the loot that falls from a rack is only for the character who smashes it. Most of the time, what falls is useless, making you wonder whether the team might have earned something more valuable had the other player smashed it instead. You might also be annoyed by the lack of a damage-per-second stat on weapons. There are slow, medium, and fast bows, for example, but the base damage stats don't help you compare different types. This is a small gripe, but it is one of many senseless, clumsy elements that crop up time and again in Hunted. A list of such oversights could continue for pages. You automatically pick up potions by walking over them, but to collect gold, you have to press a button. Why not have you collect it automatically as you do other items? You can perform finishing kill moves at random times, and these slow-motion brutalities look cinematic enough. But performing one means leaving your partner without assistance for several crucial seconds. Sure, you don't have to perform the action if you don't want to--but the game encourages you to do so. It feels as though Hunted's creators chose to implement the mechanic because it looks cool, and because all the popular games do it, rather than because it belongs. In actuality, it doesn't belong: it interferes.         You could say the same thing about the Gears-style ""roadie run"" sprinting. The barely controllable run often causes the screen to jitter uncomfortably. And in the case of a particular boss battle, when you have a limited time to run at full speed away from a charging monstrosity, it's a mess. For some reason, developer inXile chose to throw in useless cover spots between you and your destination, making it easy to slide into cover by accident when you need to charge forward. In fact, that entire boss fight is a mess. When you first enter the arena, you are prompted to hold a button so that the camera can redirect your focus to a key event, as so many games do nowadays. But you aren't given enough time to react, or even understand what is going on, before you're crushed to a pulp. (Hello, trial and error.) Hunted is fond of taking away control in this manner. During the final boss battle, for example, the camera pulls away to show you spires falling over, multiple times. But all the while, skeletons stream toward you. You might still take damage from this undead crowd, but you can't do anything about it, because Hunted: The Demon's Forge prioritizes cinematic excess over basic playability.         These are but some of the examples of flaws that might have been minor had they not been part of an ever-growing stack of them. It's possible you can overlook the aberrations in favor of the basic fun Hunted doles out amid all this silliness, but some problems aren't so easily forgivable. A scripting error can keep a bridge from falling after battle, causing you to wander around aimlessly until you realize a bug has wasted your time. (The only fix: reload.) In the Xbox 360 version, a crash at the very end of the final boss fight could force you to spend more not-so-quality time with those pesky skeletons. On the PC, you may not even get to take advantage of online co-op, Hunted's central feature. Trying to join someone's game generally gets you booted back to the menu a few moments later, and hosting your own game isn't likely to be more successful. Few players are currently able to hook up, but if you should somehow manage it, don't expect a fully-featured experience. There is no text chat or built-in voice communication; you could use an outside chat program, but that need runs contrary to the purpose of matchmaking in the first place. Nor do PC players get the split-screen play included on consoles, but it's hardly a great loss: the tiny bit of screen real estate granted to each player makes this a pitiable, last-resort option.      It's amazing that with all these issues, Hunted: The Demon's Forge isn't an awful game, but rather an underperformer. And though it's easy to call out the many issues, Hunted has qualities worth polite applause, though not a full ovation. You might at first be annoyed that you can buy and upgrade skills only at specified locations, and can do so only when joined by your partner. But this is actually a sensible solution that ensures that your buddy doesn't leave you to the spiders while he tinkers in menus. The voice acting and soundtrack are both dramatic, giving this world an air of urgency and occasionally subverting the drama with a touch of wit. You sometimes commune with the dead, their spirits rising from their corpses, mourning their own lives and telling you of demons and dragon hunters. These soliloquies are well acted and well written, and it's worth pausing to listen and soak in the ambience. Hunted is not big on ambience as a rule, however--not unless you consider ""brown"" as a kind of atmosphere. This is not an attractive game. Its goal: be as dark as possible. That's a fine goal in a game blessed with good lighting and art, but Hunted looks murky even in daylight, the grimy enemies getting lost against dingy castle walls. The PC version is the best-looking of the three, as you may expect, but even there, you can't escape the texture pop-in (morphing from barely existent to mediocre), or art design that declares ""generic dungeon crawl ahead.""        Don't dismiss Hunted as a complete disaster. Smashing an enemy frozen temporarily in ice? Frigid fun. Finding an elemental weapon in a secret hiding place? Satisfying. Zapping a roaring beast with lightning? Electric. But for every moment of fun, there's something ridiculous to add to the list of oddities. Rubble that rises three inches off the ground and generates a cover prompt when you near it. Invisible walls in bizarre places, keeping your arrows from finding their marks. Overused contextual prompts that might have you performing a finisher when you have only a few crucial moments to toss your fallen comrade a revival elixir. How much fun you have with Hunted: The Demon's Forge depends on how willing you are to overlook those oddities in favor of the bigger picture. You could say the same about most games, but then again, few games with so much promise suffer under the weight of a thousand and one tiny pebbles.     "
4105,Garfield's Fun Fest,4.0,0,"  In addition to being a popular comic-strip character, Garfield is a merchandising powerhouse. He has been featured in scads of successful books and DVDs, and, of course, his likeness has been used in suction-cupped plush toys that you can attach to your car window. Now, we have Garfield's Fun Fest, a Nintendo DS game released in association with a DVD of the same name, and like the animated film on which it's based, this game is aimed squarely at the younger set. Although it has colorful, cartoony visuals, there's not nearly enough substance to Garfield's Fun Fest to make it worth anyone's time, regardless of their age or level of interest in Garfield.        The story is so strange that you expect Garfield to wake up at the end of it. Garfield and his pals head off to the annual Grin City Fun Fest, a performance competition for comic-strip characters. But when they arrive, Garfield's girlfriend, Arlene, is swept off her feet by a grotesquely anthropomorphic cat named Ramone. Suffering from heartbreak, Garfield loses his sense of humor, so he sets out to find Freddy, the famous funny frog, to drink some of his magical funny water before returning to Grin City to win back Arlene and claim the title of Fun Fest champion. Unfortunately, this surreal story isn't told in a compelling way. There's just a series of still images accompanied by lines of text that dryly explain the events of the plot. It's also totally unfocused--characters sometimes show up for one or two panels, serve no real purpose, and then disappear from the story. Worse, there's no humor to it, no jokes or punch lines--nothing funny whatsoever. A few video clips or voice samples from the cartoon on which the game is based would have helped bring Garfield and the other characters to life. Children deserve better storytelling than this from their games.      Garfield loves to eat, and Garfield loves to sleep. The game's platforming levels are designed around these two characteristics, so at least it demonstrates a solid understanding of its license. In the platforming levels, you walk, jump, and climb your way around an area, find a few scattered items, and then seek out your goal. In most cases, Odie, Garfield's canine patsy, tags along behind you automatically, and you can hop on Odie's back for a quick dash that lets you reach otherwise inaccessible areas. As you wander around, Garfield's energy plummets rapidly. To help counter this, there are pieces of food all over the levels, and each food item you scarf up restores some energy. You'll need to munch on something or other frequently, or Garfield will run out of energy altogether. Should that happen, he'll immediately start napping, and you'll take control of Odie, who must then track down one of the alarm clocks in the level and bring it back to Garfield before he himself runs out of energy.      Patrolling the areas are enemies large and small, from spiders to dogs to mail carriers, but a quick swipe or two of Garfield's paw is all it takes to make them disappear in a puff of smoke. The biggest challenge in these areas comes from finding the items you need before you run out of energy, but after you play them a few times, you'll have them memorized, and then there's no challenge at all. The game controls just fine, but there's nothing the least bit interesting about the level design or gameplay. It's all straightforward, serviceable, and thoroughly ordinary. You get the sense that the makers of the game wanted to keep things simple so it would be accessible to children, but they erred too far on the side of caution.     Even more basic than the platforming stages are the other types of levels you encounter in the game. There are a few scrolling levels in which you either ride Odie along the ground or fly through the air on a hang glider. In the hang-gliding stages, you simply press up or down to fly in that direction, collecting food and balloons and avoiding enemies and obstacles, while in the Odie-riding stages, you can jump to collect food items and baubles called dingle balls. There's not much to these stages, but they work as a change of pace from the platforming levels. Lastly, there are a few performance levels, in which you must help Garfield perform a routine by tapping cue cards on the touch screen as stars pass over them. These levels don't have enough rhythm for them to work as a rhythm game. They're just a simple, dull test of how well you respond to visual cues.     It's shocking how little there is to Garfield's Fun Fest. You'll hit the game's conclusion so quickly you may be left staring at your DS in disbelief, thinking that can't possibly be all there is to the game. But it is. There's less than an hour's worth of gameplay here, spread out across the game's 15 levels. Once you've finished the game, you can replay the levels in an effort to earn the game's award trophies, which you win for doing things like eating every piece of food in every level or finding Garfield's teddy bear, Pooky, in every platforming stage. But the gameplay just isn't interesting enough to make playing through the levels again worthwhile. Even at 20 bucks this game is a terrible value.        The game looks nice. The character sprites are large and colorful and look just like their comic-strip counterparts. Odie in particular looks hilariously stupid. And the backgrounds have multiple layers, giving each area a sense of depth. Unfortunately there are so few areas in the game that the visuals lose their luster quickly. The music is upbeat but unremarkable. The sound effects are underwhelming, and hearing Garfield meow like an actual cat whenever he's hit seems odd, since he's typically voiced by sullen-sounding men. People expect Garfield to speak, so the lack of any voice acting doesn't make sense.     Children may be captivated by the game's graphics for a short time, and the gameplay, while mediocre, is easy and accessible enough for young kids, but they'll be done with the game faster than you can say ""I hate Mondays."" Parents looking for a good game for their children would be better served by any number of other, more substantial options. Those looking for an authentic Garfield experience would be much better off eating some lasagna and taking a nap than playing this game.  "
1569,Rory McIlroy PGA Tour,4.0,0," It starts strong, at least, with a detailed tutorial on the various swing styles that provide you with more freedom than ever before. There are three set swing types: a basic analog stick setup where power is determined by the backswing, a more complex version where the follow-through is also taken into account, and the classic three-button press system. If none of the above suits your style, a custom swing option allows you to combine elements of each approach into a personalized pairing of preferences. You can determine if you'd like to be able to hit power shots, zoom in on the trajectory of your ball, see how the wind shapes its flight, and even closely control its spin. Whether you'd like to play Rory McIlroy PGA Tour as a sports simulation or an over-the-top arcade game, the options are there. No matter what style you choose, taking a smooth backswing and making solid contact with the ball feels authentic, and the putting is challenging without feeling punishing. A dashed line represents the path of your ball from its place on the green to the hole, which takes into account the putt's speed and break. It takes time to correctly read greens with steep hills or sharp ridges, but watching a 20-foot putt bend from right to left and clink at the bottom of the cup is very satisfying. Other than the lack of load screens between holes and an improved putting system, the swing selection is the only area where Rory McIlroy PGA Tour is bigger and better than what's come before it. The number of real-life courses has been more than halved, with only eight locations that golfers will actually recognize. There are four additional make-believe locations, but none of them make up for the fact that you can't experience the Masters at one of the most famous courses of all time, Augusta National. If that’s not disappointing enough, there are just 12 playable golfers--about a quarter of what previous games have trained us to expect. Fewer golfers wouldn't be all that damning if the character creator was even passable, but what's available is one of the worst customization tools ever stuffed into a sports game. There are so few options when creating your custom golfer that it's nearly impossible to make a character that you can even pretend looks like you, unless yours happens to match one of the 11 pre-set heads or three body types provided. Instead of feeling like you're starting your own unique career on the PGA Tour, the barebones tools force you to role-play as some anonymous young golfer straight out of a stock photo. You take this indistinct, cookie-cutter avatar through a single lower-level Web.com event, and from there, you're off to the races. There's no grand buildup, no scenes of your collegiate career, and no narrative to push you forward. You go from tournament to tournament, either competing in quick rounds where you play five or six of the most important holes per day or going through all 72 holes with the hope of becoming the world's number one golfer. But without any sort of subsidiary content to complement the tournaments--such as a story, drills, or even a schedule to outline your goals--the Pro Career can quickly devolve into an unexciting slog devoid of drama. The only saving grace is the fact that your character raises levels, earns new clubs, and unlocks additional outfits just about every time you complete a round of 18. This sense of progression makes the gauntlet of tournaments much more palatable, as you're able to see your power, accuracy, and spin vastly improve and lead to pretty shots and even prettier scorecards worth hanging on the fridge. You don't manually add points to specific aspects of your game, but you can choose from different packages that might focus on power, accuracy, or more balanced play. Rory McIlroy PGA Tour fails to pair its solid mechanics with diverse and interesting content, and its myriad technical failings drag the otherwise picturesque courses into the dirt. Unfortunately, the bleak only gets bleaker as you venture outside of the career, where the online community-based Country Club and popular modes like Skins, Best Ball, and Battle Golf have all been removed. Online tournaments and head-to-head play give you some reason to test your created golfer against players more savvy than the AI, but the utter lack of gameplay variety is disappointing. If you find yourself hungry for something--anything--new to grab on to, a fresh Night Club Challenge mode is available. This extended series of challenges has you landing balls in small circles and through floating hoops to earn points, but a mid-air nitrous boost just isn't enough to make target practice drills any fun. You can earn three stars per level--similar to most popular mobile games--but the deeper you travel down the road of challenges, the less it feels like golf. Even outside this neon-lit, objective-based playground lie moments that, again, don't feel like anything you'd find on the real PGA Tour. Sinking birdie putts as your created player often leads to a shot of him or her awkwardly busting out the robot or the sprinkler--and while I don't think golf needs to be some sacred pursuit devoid of humor, the celebrations feel completely out of place. Additionally, the commentary sporadically mismatches its messages with what's actually taking place on-screen. Even though I sliced my ball out of bounds and into the trees at St. Andrews, both commentators talked about how unfortunate it was that I just hit it into the water--despite my ball being completely dry. After that, they mentioned how my approach shot had too much speed and not enough backspin as they watched it softly land on the back of the green and spin backward toward the front hole location. Like most other aspects of the game, the commentary is careless. Rory McIlroy PGA Tour fails to pair its solid mechanics with diverse and interesting content, and its myriad technical failings drag the otherwise picturesque courses into the dirt. There are just too few courses and golfers to keep you playing, and even the limited game modes available don't have anywhere near the complexity or depth we've come to expect. Whether you want to call it a shank, a duff, or a whiff, all that really matters is that Rory McIlroy PGA Tour is a poor effort from a series that was looking to make a splash in its generational debut."
3223,Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together,9.0,2,"   Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions struggled with its share of technical problems, it's refreshing to play a port as tightly coded as this one. It also does much to expand upon the original source material. In the original game for the Super Nintendo, which was never released in North America, enemies scaled with the most powerful characters in the party, making it incredibly difficult to level up the weaker characters. The remake fixes that by having whole classes level up instead; so if a character is struggling to keep up, you can always make them a Knight instead and they'll suddenly jump to Level 14.     The flipside, of course, is that new classes typically begin at Level 1, and the only way to gain experience is to put the character in a corner during a battle while everyone else does the dirty work. The process can be difficult and time-consuming, and not everyone will have the patience to level up the Dragoon or Ninja when they finally become available. Nevertheless, it's a unique approach, and one that alleviates that much of the frustration of the original. The skill system has likewise gotten a substantial overhaul. Now Battle Points are distributed following a battle, which can be spent to acquire skills that augment both offensive and defensive capabilities. There are a multitude of skills to choose from, but the key is that it's extremely difficult to be good at everything. Magic users, for instance, generally have to specialize in one or two types of magic, as each element takes up a precious skill slot. Sure, it's possible to go into battle with a mage capable of wielding every type of magic, but doing so means you won't be able to equip skills that augment your magical powers or stregthen your defense.      This balancing act helps to ensure that no character ever gets to the point that they are invincible, which is all too common in other tactical RPGs. Moreover, Tactics Ogre allows up to 12 characters on the field, meaning that there's a much greater focus on party synergy than in a game like Final Fantasy Tactics, which allows only five characters. You will quickly learn the benefit of having two Mages on the field, each with a different set of skills designed to handle all contingencies.       On the battlefield, the action plays out much like any isometric tactical RPG, which makes sense given that Tactics Ogre helped to define that subgenre in the first place. There are no ""Player"" or ""Enemy"" phases; instead, each character moves according to their speed ranking. It remains an interesting approach to tactical RPG design, as it means that time magic (such as haste) factors in much more heavily than usual. Elevation also has a major part to play, as archers and mages with the high ground can pick apart approaching forces with ease. Line of sight comes into play when trying to attack enemies from far away, so it's important to stake out the high ground when you get the chance. Fire a spell with an ally in the way, and they will get pinged in the back for some serious damage. The fixed camera would ordinarily make things especially irritating in that regard, but Tactics Ogre provides an interesting compromise. By holding the square button, it's possible to shift the camera to an overhead view, which makes it much easier to get lined up and hit enemies rather than allies. It is one of the new features that make this update such a stand-out.      Should you make a mistake anyway and accidentally hit a party member with a badly-aimed fire spell though, there's also the new CHARIOT system. This feature makes it possible to rewind as far back as 50 moves, effectively resetting the chess pieces and allowing you to take a new approach to a battle.  It's most useful when combat is going badly, as it basically automates the save/load process inherent to this genre. In a game like Tactics Ogre where characters can die permanently, the CHARIOT system is particularly useful given the suicidal tendencies of the guest characters, who will more often than not be cut down because they decided it was a good idea to rush into the middle of a pack of enemies. As certain guest characters need to survive in order to be recruited, the CHARIOT system saves a lot of frustration. The system isn't mandatory, however. It's perfectly possible to play through Tactics Ogre without even using the CHARIOT system once, which will likely be a point of pride among dedicated fans.       Perhaps the crowning achievement is the story. The original game was well ahead of its time in the way it offered players radically different paths to victory; and once again, the remake expands upon those ideas. When the ""World"" system is unlocked following the game's conclusion, it becomes possible to revisit past decisions and take a different route. Given the complexity of the story--it's a workout just to keep up with all of the factions--the ability to explore the different paths without having to start a whole new game is a welcome addition. It effectively doubles the playtime that Tactics Ogre offers, as different branches offer different missions and different allies, which makes for a vastly different experience.      And this is a story worth exploring. Denam, Catiua and Vyce are all well-defined characters with their own motivations, and there are a multitude of side characters who can become allies or enemies depending on your actions. There are no definitive ""good"" and ""evil"" choices; instead, they are mostly there to make you decide whether the ends justify the means. It's remarkable how mature the story is given that Tactics Ogre is actually a fifteen year old RPG. The complex tale of war, rebellion, jealousy and betrayal matches almost anything on the market today.     Regrettably, the ""multiplayer"" mode is really just a tease. Downloading an AI-controlled version of another player's party is all well and good, but it hardly approaches the suite of options available in War of Lions. Given that it's been done before, it would seem natural to have full-on competitive and cooperative modes for those looking to squeeze every last ounce of enjoyment from this game. It's not a crucial omission, but it is a disappointing one. Really though, the world would be a happier place if all remakes were as well thought out as Tactics Ogre. It dramatically improves on the original by fixing many of the original's flaws and building what was already great, all while adding numerous subtle flourishes to the presentation. Obviously, a complete graphical overhaul would have been more than welcome, but the enhanced spell effects and the fully-voiced story sequences do more than enough to make it feel at home on the PSP.       With its well-balanced party customization and superior story combined with new and interesting features like the CHARIOT system, Tactics Ogre is the best tactical RPG available on the PSP today. Don't let the lack of a flashy, modern presentation turn you off; anyone who loves wading into deep, lovingly-crafted RPGs are truly in for a treat.   "
153,Splatoon 3,7.0,2,"A kid-friendly competitive multiplayer shooter was a strange concept when Nintendo introduced the very first Splatoon. The unique zone-control mechanics made combat important but somewhat incidental to the chief goal of covering everything in sticky goop. Painting the battlefield gave an immediate and intuitive visual sense of who's winning and losing without the need for a clunky scoreboard. That elegant design was the kind of delightful surprise that Nintendo has become known for. After two games and a major expansion, Splatoon 3 serves as a refinement and compilation of everything that came before it. It's less novel this time around, but it's still a delight and all comes together as the most robust Splatoon game yet.Splatoon 3 assumes that you don't know all of this, of course, starting you off with a short tutorial that teaches you the basics of splatting before dumping you into the main hub area, a new city called Splatsville, in the heart of the desert Splatlands. From there you're encouraged to explore to learn more about all of the gameplay options and sites to visit, which is a little overwhelming at first. The city isn't terribly large--it is mostly a hub area for other game modes--but it feels dense with activity and nooks to explore. You can jump into the single-player campaign, co-op Salmon Run, or competitive multiplayer as you please.The single-player serves as the best starting point for new players, since it gives you more opportunity to hone your splatting skills than the brief pre-Splatsville introduction. It's much more than a glorified tutorial, though; the campaign is lengthy and makes excellent use of mechanics to iterate and present new types of challenges.The story follows your created character as the newest recruit in a team of special agents as they explore the island of Alterna, which is said to hold secrets key to understanding this post-apocalyptic squid world. There are some references to previous events and characters, but for the most part, the tale stands on its own. And true to its promise, it actually does explain what happened to humanity. Splatoon fans who have been itching to know why the world is now occupied by hybrid squids and octopuses will be pleased to finally get some answers.The major thread in the story, though, has less to do with humanity itself and more to do with learning what's up with a giant, conspicuous rocket covered in fuzzy ooze. Progress through the campaign is achieved by exploring challenge stages, but to reach them, you need to navigate around or through the fuzzy ooze. Falling in will turn you into a Captain Caveman-like creature and result in instant death. Gathering your winnings in the stages can be cashed in to pop pulsating ooze bubbles, which causes a chain reaction to erase some fuzz and open new paths. It's all nicely elegant, and the system is flexible enough to let you opt out of a stage if it's giving you trouble and just find another.The stage design itself shows a tremendous amount of creativity through the sheer variety of different kinds of challenges. The game ventures into bare-knuckle platforming, combat scenarios, and even light puzzle-solving, all without feeling foreign to its core paint-gun mechanic. The one drawback is the enemy design, which does not have enough variety to sustain itself over an 8-10-hour campaign. You'll find yourself facing off against the same handful of enemy types--with some minor variation--over and over. Despite that, the finale feels like an appropriately monumental conclusion, not just to this game but to the trilogy as a whole. Splatoon 3 amps up the scale of the final encounter to such absurd proportions that I couldn't help but laugh. It's also a test of skill unlike anything else in the campaign, which makes it feel both thrilling and also maybe a little bit cheap, given the sudden spike in difficulty.The city itself, which is the hub for the story mode and the wealth of multiplayer options, can feel overwhelming. There's a handy shortcut feature in the menu to jump straight into whatever area you want, but it's also enjoyable to just walk around the city, discovering where everything is. It makes the city feel lived-in and complete in a way that a simple menu might not, even if it's a bit extraneous. Sometimes the frame rate seemed to drop slightly while I was exploring, though, so my Switch OLED hardware might be having trouble keeping up with the demands of a bustling city.The traditional competitive mode, Turf War, is as frenetic as ever, pitting two dueling teams against each other for control of a single arena. The new stages that rotated in during pre-release multiplayer sessions fit right into the Splatoon milieu, with slightly more emphasis on verticality in spots to make use of the new Squid Surge maneuver, which lets you shoot up walls quickly. Splatoon has always made great use of cover without exactly being a cover shooter, because getting the drop on opponents behind a corner is so key to success, and the new maps are bursting with hidden alcoves and shortcuts that reward exploring.To that end, Splatoon 3 feels more like it has thought through its place as a serious competitive game, giving top-tier players more tools to hone their craft. The Recon mode is easier to find if you want to learn the ins and outs of a map before jumping into play competitively. The new lobby system, where you wait between matches, lets you tinker with weapons and see their damage outputs on dummies, which may be helpful for less experienced players to find the one that feels right.The co-op Salmon Run makes its return as well, now letting you play anytime you like instead of only during pre-scheduled events. As someone who prefers co-op multiplayer to competitive, this is a real highlight for me. Salmon Run is essentially a horde mode, having you take down encroaching waves of angry fish and collecting eggs to advance to the next phase of combat. It can get chaotic as you ratchet up the difficulty, but I haven't had enough time yet to determine if the mode ends up feeling too repetitive when I can play as much as I want.It's also nice that Salmon Run gives you progress toward your catalog, rather than locking you purely into competitive multiplayer to earn new fashionable rewards. It doesn't, however, award weapons tickets for the competitive mode, so you'll have to earn those through Turf War itself.That progress is stymied somewhat by frequent and unforgiving disconnects. In these situations, Splatoon 3 never made it clear who had dropped out, but any single player dropping on either team just immediately erases any experience you would have gained for the match, no matter how close you were to finishing it. It would also occasionally falsely accuse me of dropping out and warn me not to let it happen too often, when I hadn't let it happen at all. These problems were more prevalent in Turf War than in Salmon Run, which I can only chalk up to more rage-quits in a competitive environment, along with a bigger player count. Aside from the general frustration of cutting off a match I wanted to see through to the end, this can also slow your leveling progress--which I already found to be going at a snail's pace.Once you've gained enough experience in Turf War, you gain access to Anarchy Battles, a whole new tier of objective-based modes with more complex rule sets. Those range from zone control to capturing clams and depositing them into your enemy base, and they provide a decent change of pace from the traditional Turf War battles. But since they're gated for veterans, they're also much more competitive and would be better suited for traditional shooter tools that Splatoon 3 lacks--like easy direct team communication and the ability to change your loadout on the fly. With these elements lacking or inconsistent, regular Turf War battles just feel more inviting and, for me at least, much less frustrating.For an even more significant departure from the norm, you can take part in Tableturf Battles, a new minigame making its debut in Splatoon 3, and a standout original idea. The card-based game takes the traditional Splatoon concepts of aiming to cover the most area with ink, and approximates it with Tetrimino-like block configurations in an overhead perspective of the squared-off battlefield. You need to build a path of ink across the field of play, boxing in your opponent and covering your own zone with ink. It's a simple concept that, like Splatoon's core mechanics, are intuitive and easy to understand in an instant. I found myself spending multiple hours in Tableturf alone, and I had to will myself back to Turf War so that I could earn more multiplayer progress.On the whole, Splatoon 3 hass a wildly inventive story campaign paired with a massive amount of multiplayer modes and options, making it the most robust Splatoon game so far. Though it creaks slightly under the weight of Nintendo's online infrastructure, this third game brings together everything that made the past games work, and even some new surprises like the stellar Tabletop Battles. It won't win over anyone who hasn't enjoyed past Splatoon games, but for newcomers and experienced squid kids alike, this one is worth diving into."
133,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II,8.0,2,"This rebooted version of Task Force 141 features Price and the familiar faces of Simon ""Ghost"" Riley, Kyle ""Gaz"" Garrick, and John ""Soap"" MacTavish. However, Modern Warfare 2 introduces a new ally with Colonel Alejandro Vargas of the Mexican Special Forces. While this is a different story than 2009's Modern Warfare 2, it does reintroduce General Shepherd from the original campaign. Modern Warfare 2019's Kate Laswell and the PMC group known as Shadow Company all make a return as well.Playing as members of Task Force 141, you are put to the test when a United States airstrike kills Al-Qatala leader General Ghorbrani, whose successor, Hassan Zyani, vows revenge and teams up with an international drug cartel to transport stolen U.S. ballistic missiles. Hassan plans to launch the missiles against United States targets and it falls upon Task Force 141 to stop this from happening. The campaign is a globe-trotting affair, sending you to fight in places like Amsterdam, Mexico, Chicago, and even parts of Al Mazrah, the fictional setting of Warzone 2.0's map. This gives a refreshing variety to the scenery from mission to mission, with nighttime stealth ops, desert battles, a prison break, and even an oil rig set piece that feels like a throwback to the original Modern Warfare 2's The Only Easy Day...Was Yesterday mission, without being a remake of it.Modern Warfare 2 offers a bit more personality to the characters you play and fight alongside than in past games, as there are now dialogue options to speak to your fellow soldiers and ask questions. In the mission Recon By Fire, I could have Gaz make some small talk, and I chose to chat with Kate Laswell, which helped humanize the characters a little more. This is totally optional and you can choose to say nothing, but it's nice to have an extra layer of dialogue. I really enjoyed the chit-chat between gunfights, and it breathes more life into side characters who could easily fall flat. For example, Kate mentions her wife, a martial status that didn't seem to be revealed in the last game. There were also some lighthearted bro moments with Soap and Ghost during the quiet moments of an otherwise very serious survival mission.Farah, a character introduced in Modern Warfare 2019, resurfaces as an ally in Violence and Timing, but it's a bit disappointing that she doesn't play more of a role in the campaign, especially since she was last seen teamed up with Price for Modern Warfare's post-launch story in Warzone. She was featured in the fight alongside Price as he slowly helped reassemble Task Force 141, which indicated that she would be a new addition to Price's force, but this doesn’t come to pass, sadly. However, Alejandro feels like a good addition to Captain Price's ever-growing team of allies. When he's recruited as Task Force 141's guide through Mexico, you quickly learn he's a man willing to risk everything to protect his fictional city of Las Almas from the corruption of the cartel, thus being the perfect guy to help you get the stolen missiles out of cartel hands. The writers do a good job of showing Alejandro's emotion through scenes of interrogating a former ally turned enemy, and he's easily a character you start to care about when shit hits the fan, and I'd welcome his return to the franchise if future stories permitted.Without giving anything away, Modern Warfare 2's quest to locate the missiles and stop the terrorists is filled with twists and betrayal just like the original Modern Warfare 2. Infinity Ward does a solid job balancing the nostalgia of the original series, while also giving a brand-new and engaging narrative.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 features 17 campaign missions, and these range from large-scale, movie-style action set pieces to dialed-back stealth sessions. It's pretty much everything you'd expect from a Call of Duty campaign. There's really not much added in terms of major innovation here to really wow you, but the missions pack a lot of fun and nostalgia as the campaign features several classic Modern Warfare missions with new twists. The game also provides some missions that feel more open-world than we've seen in the past, giving you more opportunities to explore different tactics for a fight. Some stealth missions let you scour the area for the perfect sniper point to line up a collateral kill, while other just give you multiple pathways to decide how you want to attack or sneak past your enemies. This freedom isn't as vast as playing an open-world RPG, but the added exploration and opportunities is a welcome change to Call of Duty's usual led-by-the-hand campaign style.For example, the mission Close Air is very similar to Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare's Death From Above mission with the player-controlled AC-130 gunship sequence. In Close Air, you play as members of Shadow Company, who are providing air support in the AC-130 for Ghost, Soap, and Alejandro. This was a fan-favorite mission in Modern Warfare, and Close Air provides an experience that's just as satisfying as you destroy whole buildings with the power of the AC-130.Another called Recon By Fire is very reminiscent of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare's iconic All Ghillied Up stealth mission. What sets apart Modern Warfare 2's version is the improvements in AI. You can no longer memorize enemy movement patterns and hide accordingly, as enemy soldiers more dynamically search the area for you, and they will spot you much easier than in past games. I criticized Modern Warfare 2's advanced AI in the multiplayer beta, but the campaign's enemy NPCs proved to be a much greater adversary. Unfortunately, I can't say your AI allies are quite as capable, so expect to do most of the work in taking down enemies.Vehicle chase sequences are a staple of Call of Duty campaigns, and Modern Warfare 2 has one of my favorites. Violence and Timing is another instance of Modern Warfare 2 eschewing the usual linear feel of these missions in CoD games to offer variety and player choice. The mission hits a few fun and over-the-top moments, with a satisfying vehicle chase, a brief period of hanging upside down from an aircraft while in gunfights, and vehicle hijack shenanigans.Part of the fun in Violence and Timing stems from Modern Warfare 2's new maneuvering mechanics, which give you the ability to quickly swap seats in a vehicle and even stand on the roof of cars to hop over and hijack an enemy's ride. All of these actions let you choose how you want to accomplish the mission. You can opt to stay in one vehicle, assuming it doesn't get demolished during the skirmish, or you can hop from one hijacked vehicle to another as you work your way through the enemy convoy. It's a level of dynamism that injects greater thrills into a sequence that is already a high-octane blockbuster set-piece.While the game features mostly the same equipment as previous years, Modern Warfare 2 adds a new crafting layer to the game. Some missions require you to do some light scavenging to craft tools and weapons such as mines, smoke bombs, shivs, and a pry tool, which is used to open locked crates and doors. Finding supplies to craft pry tools does get a bit tedious after the first few times, and I sometimes wished I could just Incredible Hulk my way through more doors. Nevertheless, it was more of a minor annoyance than something that ruined the experience and, in its current form, it feels like experimentation for something coming in future Call of Duty content. In terms of brand-new equipment, the game introduces the new snake cam device to slide under a door jam and get enemy visuals from the other side.As someone who plays all of the Call of Duty campaigns, starting on Regular difficulty and then completing on Veteran, I was surprised to find Regular offered more of a challenge than usual. Even with this default setting, you can die in just a few bullets, but some of my struggles may also be due to the advanced AI in Modern Warfare 2, as in some stealth missions I found that the enemy NPCs spotted me easily no matter how stealthy I tried to play. Although it felt like AI was more intuitive in their searches during stealth missions, there were times where I was confused how the enemy spotted me. Their eagle-eye vision might just be a little too good, to the point where it sometimes felt unfair. I died way more than I ever expected, which was quite a humbling experience.That increase in difficulty highlighted one of the campaign's biggest issues, which is its handling of checkpoints. These were spread out pretty far in some missions, and I would have to replay a large chunk of a mission all over again if I died, while other missions saved my place at awkward points in the action. Several times I died and respawned right near the enemy who just killed me, and it made for a tough recovery, especially in the stealth missions. Sometimes I respawned only to die almost instantly, and there were times where it seemed I was only able to push forward out of sheer luck.On PlayStation 5, the graphics were sharp and everything ran smoothly. Your personal experience could vary depending on your platform but I didn't run into any crashes, major bugs, or performance issues. The only weird encounter was during a building-clearing section in the Recon By Fire mission, where it took a while to find the remaining enemies to reach a checkpoint because all of the soldiers were stuck inside some crates that served as room decor.The success of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2019 left big shoes for the sequel to try and fill, but overall, Modern Warfare 2 is a strong successor. In an early preview of Modern Warfare 2, I wasn't impressed with the new maneuverability mechanics, nor did expect the changes to make such an impact on the game. However, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed the freedom to tackle scenarios in my own way, including all the carjacking. The variety of locations from mission to mission also ensured there was never a dull moment. My time with Modern Warfare 2 and Task Force 141 was a blast, and truly feels like Infinity Ward created this campaign as a greatest hits list for the series. My surprise enjoyment of the added open-world set pieces and new maneuverability gives me hope that these elements of freedom may become more of a staple for the franchise, and that’s a future for Call of Duty that I can get behind."
4823,TVDJ,2.0,0,"Import: The rhythm/dancing game genre unparalleled popularity in Japan, which is made apparent by the glut of Bemani and similarly themed titles currently on the market. While they all tend to have the commonality of a heaping helping of style combined with some simple, addictive gameplay, everyone has a gimmick. Sony has decided to veer wildly from the standard musical them of rhythm games with TVDJ, a rhythm game based not on dancing, playing a musical instrument or rapping, but splicing together TV shows on the fly. While a wholly unique concept, TVDJ quite simply doesn't add up.   TVDJ throws you into the role of the new video editor at the fledgling BBB television station. The station is in trouble, and it's up to your masterful video editing skills to get ratings up and save the station. You then edit your way through four shows, none of which, unfortunately, are quite bizarre enough to capture the attention of those seeking that weird Japanese flavor. To edit the show, a row of cells scrolls across the bottom of the screen, divided into cell segments. Each face button on your controller spits out a short video clip, filling between one and four cells. You then fill up the segments with exactly 8 cells, and variety counts. To be blunt, TVDJ substitutes a test of basic arithmetic skills for actual gameplay. If you can count to 8, you can play TVDJ. While interesting in concept, this gameplay doesn't offer enough depth to base an entire game around.   Not that there is much of a game in TVDJ in the first place. With a total of four levels in the game, each level lasting no more than 5 five minutes, TVDJ can be beat in 20 minutes or less, guaranteed. After beating the game once, you're treated to the same exact game, with slightly higher difficulty. The shallow gameplay, shortage of levels, and lack of options make TVDJ's replay value all but nonexistent. The rest of TVDJ is equally unimpressive. The sound is quickly forgotten, as it offers nothing terribly engaging or irritating. Utilizing the soon-to-be reviled cell-shading technique, TVDJ's graphics suffice, though it's probably the least impressive use of the effect to date.    TVDJ is a minigame posing as a complete game, as it has neither the gameplay depth nor the length to qualify it as a game in and of itself. TVDJ will never see the light of day here in the States, which is no real loss, as its short-lived novelty isn't worth the time and money of even the most fanatical rhythm fan."
2753,Uncharted: Golden Abyss,7.0,2,"      While the story might not fare so well, thankfully, the action and platforming does--for the most part. Navigating your way through the many jungles, rocky mountain ranges, and ruined temples is as easy as on the console versions, thanks to the Vita's full complement of analog sticks. The path you take is decidedly linear, but a variety of walls to climb--some of which crumble beneath you--rope swings, death-defying leaps, and stunning scenery keep the excitement flowing. It's when you use one of the Vita's more esoteric input options that things begin to falter. A tutorial at the start of the game introduces these to you gradually, but trying to remember what inputs to use can be confusing. Take using a rope, for example. You can push forward and hit X to jump to it, or you can tap on the rope. Once there, you can climb it using the left analog stick or stroke the rear touch pad with two fingers to do the same. How about swinging on it? There's the analog stick again. Or you can rock the Vita back and forth to accomplish the same thing.             There's cursing to be done during action set pieces too, though it's more ""f*** yeah!"" than ""f*** you."" There are some impressive moments as temples collapse and buildings explode while you do your best to escape impending doom, even if the frame rate takes a hammering during the most action-packed sections. A canoe ride and a trip down some treacherous river rapids help to mix things up, providing some exhilarating moments. It's a shame there aren't more of them, with long, repetitive stretches of platforming draining any excitement you might have enjoyed. If you're a fan of shiny things, though, there are heaps of hidden collectibles to find, as well as a picture-taking minigame that encourages exploration, even if it's only within the game's linear confines. Collectibles that you find can be traded with other Vita users via Near (Vita's social networking and discovery service) in ""The Black Market,"" which can be helpful in finding some of the rarer ones and earning trophies for complete collections.     Uncharted 3. But then, Golden Abyss is full of disappointments. The action set pieces are great, but there's too few of them; the voice acting is exemplary, but the narrative doesn't do it justice; the touch and motion controls work well for some actions, but they ruin others. For every moment of enjoyment you have, something comes along to spoil it. Despite its problems, though, Golden Abyss still succeeds in delivering some intense, entertaining action and combat. It's not quite the full-blown Uncharted experience on the move that you might have hoped for, but it's damn close. And for that, it should be commended.  "
3607,Pokemon Dash,5.0,1,"  It's hardly surprising that Nintendo would have a brand-new Pokémon game ready to go within the first few months of the DS's launch, what with it being one of Nintendo's biggest franchises and everything. However, what is thoroughly shocking is how completely half-baked this first attempt is. Titled Pokémon Dash, this bizarre racing game is simply one of the laziest uses of the DS's touch screen technology to date, featuring highly repetitive gameplay that gets old before you've even finished your first race.        The basic gameplay in Pokémon Dash works as follows: As the lovable Pikachu, you participate in something of a foot race against five other notable Pokémon characters. These races consist of finding a series of checkpoints scattered across a fairly vast and treacherous landscape with varying types of terrain. To race, there is really only one control mechanic. You simply take the stylus, and repeatedly scrape it across your touch screen in the direction you want Pikachu to run. The faster you do this, the faster the little guy will run. If this sounds like it might be a little repetitive, you're wrong. It's actually a lot repetitive. The action of just briskly pushing your stylus across the screen becomes very tiresome very quickly, and at times, you may actually find yourself worried about scratching up your touch screen.     The actual racing itself is broken up by periodic bouts of hot air balloon flying and rough-terrain crossing. Essentially, the way the race tracks are designed is that you'll find lots of lava pits, ice fields, chasms, and oceans blocking you from getting to the next checkpoint within a stage. Some of these things can be traversed naturally, though they will slow you down. Others require you to run over a special icon on the map first, which will let you walk on lava, or something to that effect. Others still simply can't be crossed without the aid of a balloon. You can find balloon icons all over the map, and once you find one, you'll suddenly find the gleeful Pikachu launched into the air. At this point you can move to anywhere on the map before you come diving back to the ground. You can even pop the balloons to head to the ground much faster (though you'll want to avoid doing that over a particularly hard surface, as it will stun Pikachu temporarily).     While these few little things do add some variety to the gameplay, the problem is that the whole racing model is simply flawed, largely because of its reliance on a near-broken radar system. Whenever you find yourself airborne, you'll be able to see the entire map, and you'll see a little map that displays where the next active checkpoint is on the upper screen of the DS. The problem is that it only shows a scant bit of the terrain around where the checkpoint is, and the little arrows that appear onscreen while you're racing disappear. If you can recall what direction they were pointing before you actually go airborne, you might be able to find the next spot reasonably quickly. However, if you don't, you can very easily fall behind. In fact, it's really in your best interest to just play through all of the tracks at least a few times before actually trying to win any of the races, as you pretty much need to memorize the checkpoints before racing effectively.     Apart from these problems, there are some other annoying quirks that further bog down the experience. For one, the challenge in the game is simply all over the map. The first sets of races you can play are supposedly a normal difficulty, though overall, they're almost ridiculously easy, since your opponents are insanely slow. Once you move onto the hard mode, the difficulty shoots through the roof, and successful races almost become a fleeting afterthought. There are also some other irritating little things, such as the game's pause menu, which is just plain dumb. Basically, the pause menu is mapped to the touch screen, and when you select any option, it acts on it without any confirmation menu whatsoever. This means that if you accidentally, say, hit the ""exit to main screen"" option instead of ""restart race,"" option, the game will exit out of your current GP and you lose all progress up to that point. Had there been a confirmation menu to help correct this, it wouldn't be a problem at all. But then, considering how generally thrown together this game feels, it's almost unsurprising that issues like this would exist.     Pokémon Dash also offers a couple of other available modes beyond the GPs, though none of them are any good. The multiplayer consists of all the available tracks, playable for up to six players, as well as a fairly weak battle mode. Each player will need his or her own copy of the game to participate. There's also a weird custom track mode, where, by plugging in one of the GBA Pokémon RPG cartridges, like Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed, and LeafGreen, you can basically create new courses that are shaped like Pokémon characters. However, this mode is almost totally worthless, mainly because the custom tracks just look plain awful and are rarely ever any more (and sometimes are significantly less) fun than the already included tracks.        Even outside of this custom track mode, the basic tracks in the game just don't look impressive at all. Everything looks flat, ugly, and unpleasant. The Pokémon racers aren't really any better, though they are marginally better than the nasty race environments. The top-down camera view works serviceably for what the game is, though it doesn't allow you much breathing room to see what's coming up ahead. The audio in the game is equally annoying, featuring a lot of Pikachu's cutesy voice, some fairly forgettable music, and a few cheap sound effects here and there. All told, it just seems like the developer had no aspirations whatsoever to do anything decent with this game's presentation.     Though it may be the first DS game to bear the crest of the Pokémon license, Pokémon Dash is a game that will be unappealing to even the most vehement of fans. The game itself has so little to do with the actual, established Pokémon brand beyond an exceedingly halfhearted use of the show's characters, and the whole racing mechanic just falls terribly flat. DS fans will have to wait a little longer for a decent Pokémon game, as this one is most certainly not it.  "
4205,Code Lyoko: Fall of X.A.N.A.,4.0,0," Code Lyoko is a cartoon of many colors. It's made in France, looks like an anime, and features traditional 2D art and flashy CGI. The storylines float from planet-endangering digital attacks to preteen relationship drama. You would expect the game to follow a similar path by giving you tons of variety and a captivating, albeit adolescent story. Sadly, every facet of the show has received a giant downgrade in transition to video game form. From lackluster visuals and bland gameplay to an incoherent story, everything about Code Lyoko: Fall of X.A.N.A. is disappointing.      The game centers around five boarding-school students with abnormally large foreheads who live double lives as virtual superheroes in the online world of Lyoko. It's like The Matrix, except instead of agents, there are monsters powered by the evil virus X.A.N.A. This game follows the fourth and final season of the show, picking up right after the previous season ends. There are no primers to introduce you to the characters, and no tutorials to teach you how to play; it's as if the game assumes that the only people who will be playing it are hardcore Code Lyoko fans.        Like the show, Code Lyoko: Fall of X.A.N.A. is split into two different parts: the 2D world, which represents the real world that the kids live in, and the 3D world of Lyoko. Here, the 2D world exists only to let you hear the latest gossip and inside jokes from the show's characters. These sections are completely pointless and can thankfully be skipped without any detriment to the story or gameplay.     All of the real action happens in Lyoko. Once virtualized, you'll guide a superdeformed sprite around a three-dimensional world in search of switches to open doors, while battling random monsters along the way. And that's it; there are no side quests or special dungeons, just switches, doors, and monsters for nine laborious hours.     When a battle starts, the game shifts to a turn-based role-playing game, giving you control of all four Lyoko warriors. The bottom screen shows your menu choices and the top screen displays the action. After an attack has been performed, a recharge meter shows up and prevents you from attacking until it is full. The recharge length depends on the strength of the attack, so special moves will leave you waiting a bit longer. The system works well, but it isn't very challenging. Most enemies will go down within a couple of turns, and if you stagger your attacks correctly, some of your foes won't even have an opportunity to strike. If you do find yourself in danger, you can visit the laboratory to purchase healing items and attack viruses. You can also configure plug-ins, which act as modifiers to different stats. Given that the game doesn't let you spend experience points when you level up, this is as close as you'll get to customizing your characters.     Like everything else in the game, the controls aren't particularly interesting. The stylus acts as nothing more than a computer mouse, so don't expect to slash up monsters Ninja Gaiden-style. There isn't much to do outside of holding it down to guide your warrior, and tapping menus to select attacks. There are a handful of poorly executed minigames that crop up in battle, but they appear only when your character has sustained enough damage, and they do little to make the combat more engaging.      The one high point of the game lies in its multiplayer. If you have a friend who also owns the game, each of you can load up your Lyoko warriors and battle it out using a variety of options. Your warriors will have all of the items and plug-ins from your single-player saved game, so the further along that you are, the more powerful your warriors will be. In the event that your warriors are under- or overpowered compared to those of your friends, you can place various handicaps on the match. In addition to the classic battle mode, there's a challenge mode and a bet mode. The first sets a number of goals such as battling without items or using only two of the four warriors, and the second lets you wager some of your items on the outcome of the battle. Battles against a human opponent are far more intense than anything that the single-player game offers. Having to quickly manage attacks and react to a real person speeds up the combat and adds a touch of excitement not found in the rest of the game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Even if you're a fan of the last Code Lyoko game you'll be disappointed with the underwhelming visuals in Fall of X.A.N.A. The impressive 2D artwork is still there, but it's a waste because most of your time in the game is spent staring at a deformed representation of an already oddly proportioned character as he or she shuffles around a drab environment ripe with texture tearing and fog. The polygonal characters shown in battles fare a bit better, but they suffer from stiff animation. The effects for items and special moves look as if they were taken straight out of an early SNES game. Most of the sounds consist of digital menu bleeps and the shuffling sound of your warrior's feet. Forgettable music loops in the background add to the hypnotic boredom.      Code Lyoko: Fall of X.A.N.A. is a dull game. The absence of any real fun or challenge makes it feel less like a game and more like a chore. If you're dying for some Code Lyoko action, the 9 to 10 hours that you would spend playing this game would probably be better spent watching a marathon of the show.    "
2720,Binary Domain,8.0,2,"  What if you lived in a world where robots were as prevalent as humans? You'd see them every day--in the street, at your workplace, in the coffee shop--made to mimic the human figure but easily identifiable as machines. But what if the gap narrowed to the point where human and humanlike robot were indistinguishable to the naked eye? The soldiers in Binary Domain have dedicated themselves to preventing such a world. It's a familiar futuristic trope, and much about this third-person cover-based shooter is familiar. But if you probe past the humdrum fundamentals, Binary Domain reveals some intriguing elements that boost its appeal beyond the ordinary.       The first of these rewards lies in the shooting mechanics. The key is not so much what guns you are shooting (a basic military arsenal with scant futuristic touches) but, rather, whom you are shooting. Your enemies are robotic, most of them humanoid, and they break apart in such a marvelous variety of ways that you won't soon tire of fighting them. Armor plates burst off in showers of sparks, and explosions send enemies rag-dolling, but the real treat is what they do when injured. They limp. They hop. They crawl. They doggedly pursue you until you deliver the killing blow, and the realistic animations are a treat even after you've downed hundreds of foes.   The Matrix, but it also resonates strongly with the struggles this society faces and the solutions it has devised.     On the other end of the size spectrum, hand dryers that look like jet turbines offer a glimpse at what the Dysons of the future might engineer. The eye-catching elements aren't everywhere you look, not by a long shot, but these environmental highlights are what you'll remember when the campaign ends.  (Oh, and the Tully's Coffee shop, which is the most incongruous and unexpected product placement to come along in a great while.)       When you're in the field, you are frequently given the choice of which characters you want by your side, though this decision has more to do with personality than combat efficacy. You do the heavy lifting when it comes to robot killing, though your teammates aren't useless. They down some foes and can revive you when you're incapacitated, and they rarely devolve into being a liability. You can give them (and yourself) a boost by spending the credits you earn for robo slaughter at the plentiful vending machines. There are basic weapon upgrades, as well as a neat little nano-enhancement system that lets you try to maximize attribute boosts by arranging upgrade pieces of varying sizes on a small grid. It's not a huge asset, but it's a nice injection of variety and progression.     Though these upgrades don't have a big impact on your teammates, there is a way to motivate them. Contextual commands are easily accessed from a quick menu, but if you plug in a microphone, you can use upward of 70 voice phrases to communicate with your AI allies. Tactical orders (retreat, charge), positive reinforcement (awesome, nice work), chastising remarks (idiot, you fool), personal admissions (I like you, lookin' pretty sweet), and vulgar curses (choice four-letter words) are all included in Binary Domain's sizable lexicon. The voice recognition can be unreliable, and dealing with ambient noise and third-party hardware can present issues, but it's never crucial to survival, so these issues are merely frustrating rather than downright aggravating.       When the campaign comes to a climax and concludes (somewhere in the nine-hour ballpark), you'll be happy you saw it through, but get ready to temper that enthusiasm if you hop online for multiplayer. The cooperative Invasion mode has plenty of robot killing for up to four players, but the repetitive environments and bland soldiers aren't much encouragement for soldiering on through 50 waves of enemies. The competitive multiplayer has a basic suite of modes for up to 10 players, with variants that disallow respawning. Though you can get into some good matches, the maps are uninspired and practically encourage spawn camping. Furthermore, both online modes are hampered by lag, which results in visual bugs and connection issues.     So Binary Domain is a bad bet for the multiplayer aficionado, but for those looking for a shooter campaign with a refreshing vibe, it's a very good choice. The variety and destructibility of the enemies, the intriguing and well-paced environments, and the lively and colorful cast all combine to make Binary Domain an enjoyable and energetic success.    "
2529,XCOM: Enemy Unknown,8.0,2,"   X-COM: UFO Defense, but like that game, it cannily instills a sense of fear. Earth is under attack by aliens, and the game makes no attempts to humanize the attackers. This isn't --it's , and extraterrestrial invaders are to be annihilated, not welcomed or bargained with. This might be a modern rendition of an older game, but developer Firaxis relies on old-fashioned fears to drive its narrative. Almond-eyed greys and floating saucers ripped from popular culture need no explanation: they're clearly not of this world, and they're clearly out to destroy us. And so it's up to you, the commander of the super-secretive XCOM organization, to make Earth a safe haven once again.     Gameplay is divided into two portions: base management and combat scenarios. Near the beginning of the game, you select a location for your base of operations from one of several possibilities. The choices are more limited than the ones in the original X-COM, and this is the only base you manage through the course of the game. If you're a fan of the original, being limited to a single base might seem cause for concern, as might the subsequent loss of the oft-challenging base invasions. It may not share the full breadth of the game that spawned the franchise, but it would be difficult to accuse Enemy Unknown of ""dumbing down"" the core gameplay. Nevertheless, if you crave a relentless challenge (if not quite as relentless as the nail-biting X-COM: Terror From the Deep), you should play on classic difficulty, rather than the default difficulty level.      And so there are some changes to adjust to, but once Enemy Unknown is in full swing, you will be enthralled by its turn-based combat missions. Upon learning of an alien threat, you select units from your barracks to fill out your squad, and you are whisked to the point of contact. You eventually command up to six squad members--and in time, you might replace them with robotic SHIV units--but even in the early hours, the eerie atmosphere and faint sounds of skittering alien feet get you immediately invested. Upon discovery, the aliens are introduced with a burst of discordant music and a close-up of their ugly faces, and thus the stage is set for battle.        The basic concept is simple: get squad members behind cover where damage is minimized, and then take aim. Each squad member gets two actions per turn, though some of your soldiers will earn ways of extending this basic number. When possible, you want to move from cover to cover, diminishing the enemies' chances of landing shots while flanking them to lessen the benefit of their own cover spots. In the early hours, your options are few. But the soldiers that survive the mission level up and gain access to new abilities that you assign back at base. Additionally, you spend funds on better weapons, upgraded armor, and other enhancements. Simple grunts become trustworthy killing machines--and when your killing machines are fully leveled and decked out in your finest equipment, you'd best keep them alive.      But soldiers can, and do, fall in battle. The units don't have much personality apart from their battlefield quips, but you can customize them beyond their loadouts, giving them names, changing their hairdos, and adjusting the color of their armor. (Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 owners be aware: some cosmetic customization features require that you enter a code that comes with brand-new copies of the game.) But while you may not develop an emotional connection with your soldiers, you'll certainly come to rely on the skills of your most senior combatants. Losing an effective soldier in battle is a tragic turn of events, though in some cases, a downed soldier can still be saved if you have a soldier with a medkit in battle--or if you are lucky enough to conquer the enemy before the unlucky victim bleeds out.      So you want to keep your soldiers alive. And that means treading carefully, even before you have encountered hulking berserkers and speedy floaters. As you close in on the game's final hours, you'll have discovered that managing the fog of war is as vital as performing the right actions once combat has commenced. If you move too quickly into the fray, you risk alerting more enemies than you can handle at once. One of your greatest adversaries in Enemy Unknown is your own patience, and this battle against human nature is part of the tension that builds from the moment you enter the map. Where are your foes? Should you risk flanking a cyberdisc if it means uncloaking a portion of the map? If you're already in over your head, you may not want a trio of pointy-legged chrysalids intruding on your personal space.        If they do intrude, however, you might still have the tools you need to survive. Soldiers of different classes have different roles in battle, and depending on their loadouts, you have a number of ways of approaching the enemy. Close-range weapons like shotguns and alloy cannons are super effective, but getting in close can be a big risk. Meanwhile, having a sniper move too close to a quick-witted floater can dramatically reduce your chances of landing the shot. You need to know your soldiers, and develop strategies that make sense. A quartet of mutons looks threatening, but you have ways of whittling down their numbers if you play your cards right. A SHIV's suppressive fire and a soldier's flush skill can be used in tandem to bring down stubborn foes. Alien grenades, shredder rockets, and other doodads can be more than helpful as well. Just as a seemingly simple situation can turn deadlier than you imagined, a difficult encounter can be tamed with a few smart moves.        A great strategy isn't foolproof, however: you still need the numbers on your side. Each offensive action has a chance to hit, and while it rarely makes sense to gamble when you've got a 1 percent chance of landing your shot, the choice isn't always that simple. Triumph can hinge on a dice roll. Your ability to maintain proper distance is the best way of maintaining supremacy, but you're still at the mercy of mathematics. You might shake your fist and curse when you miss a shot that had an 85 percent chance to hit--but you'll breathe a sigh of relief when the numbers aren't on your side, yet you land a critical hit that shifts the tide of battle. The tension of the dice roll is further drawn out by the cinematic animations that accompany the action. The camera closes in on your sniper and you hear the rifle charge. The fear rises and your heart skips. The anxiety might be relieved by the sight of a sectoid erupting in a gusher of green goo. But it might also be exacerbated by watching the laser fire miss the target, which means finding a new way of handling the danger--and the stress.       The glamorous camera angles that dramatize the successes and failures often contribute to the excitement, but the glam-cam occasionally glitches out, as do other aspects of Enemy Unknown's presentation. Along with close-ups of mean mutons beating their chests and thin men looking as if you caught them in the middle of something insidious, you get close-ups of plasma rifles clipping through walls, laser fire shooting through vehicles, and leafy bushes obscuring the entire screen in all their leafiness. A soldier might lean out from behind a wall and bug out, pointing her empty hands in one direction while her still-holstered weapon fires somewhere else. These seem like small considerations, but the game goes out of its way to look cinematic, so the visual problems really stand out. That's particularly true on the PlayStation 3, which suffers from occasional frame rate stutters in addition to these foibles.     Back at the base, in the meanwhile, you must manage a global array of countries that provide funding to the XCOM project. Their funds are important, because you use them to perform research (alien autopsies, for instance), enhance your squads (unlock another squad slot, perhaps), and purchase new facilities at your base. You view your base from a side cutaway view, ant farm style, and add facilities by excavating outward and downward. Those facilities fit into the bigger picture in a number of ways, producing engineers that you need to research upgrades in your foundry, for instance, or allowing you to place satellites over more regions of the globe.     Satellites are your way of keeping tabs on the state of the globe. Should a satellite detect a nearby UFO, you're engaged in a brief minigame in which an available interceptor attempts to take down the flying menace. Those interceptors--as well as the actions they perform, and the advanced weapons they can equip--also cost you funds, so it's well worth your while to keep different countries well protected. Should a country's populace panic, they may very well withdraw from the project, which negatively affects your monthly income. You can sell off various alien parts you earn after each battle should you need the funds, but those bits and pieces are used to both research and manufacture upgrades. You must always be aware of how your decisions impact future options. Buying titan armor for all your soldiers is tempting, for instance, but would those funds be better spent on more uniform satellite coverage, or foundry projects? There are consequences for every choice.        If you want to exercise your strategic skills outside of the core single-player experience, you can face friends and strangers online in one-versus-one matches. Players are given an equal number of points to spend on units. Soldiers can cost any number of points depending on how you equip them, while alien units are a set number of points each. There is no base management involved in multiplayer games, which are quick-and-dirty deathmatches in which the best (and sometimes, the luckiest) player wins. The matches have the same tense qualities as they do in single-player, with the added tension of not knowing your foe's play style, or the unit makeup of the opposing team.      You'll see strategies here that you won't see in the campaign. The opponent might use ghost armor to go invisible and then use the overwatch ability to spew plasma at you while you reposition yourself. Or he might buff up powerful human heavies even further by using a sectoid's mind merge. The multiplayer is enjoyable as a result, though its one-off nature doesn't have the long-lasting charms of the full-fledged campaign. You can save a go-to squad for easy use in multiplayer battles, though it's a shame you can't save more than one. Having multiple slots for various squads would be a really handy time-saver.      The limited number of multiplayer maps also takes some of the edge off of online competition, which echoes a limitation in the campaign. While you encounter a healthy number of maps when playing offline, Enemy Unknown does not feature the randomly generated maps of the game that inspired it. You eventually start to see maps repeat, which can be noticeable when you're traversing a map in Russia that you played in North America. The enemies may be in different spots, and you might begin battle from a different corner of the map, but the element of surprise isn't as strong in this game as it was in the 1994 original.       Don't be too concerned by the minor drawbacks, however. XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a wonderful and worthy strategy game with a layer of campy charm that makes the stone-faced seriousness of the game's characters all the more endearing. It's also remarkably accessible, thanks to a great interface that feels comfortable whether you're using a keyboard and mouse or have a controller in your hand. Enemy Unknown packs dense amounts of dramatic tension into each turn. And so it's time to eliminate the alien threat, commander. Select a location, build your base…and save humanity.     "
1670,Sunless Sea,6.0,1," Sid Meier's Pirates and Koei's Uncharted Waters series, Sunless Sea sets you loose on The Unterzee with a simple ship, a crew, some supplies, and a blank sea chart that slowly fills in as you explore the zee. That last bit is crucial to understanding where Sunless Sea's heart lies, as your primary instinct in this game will almost always be to sail for the black spots to see what's there. Your reward? A cavalcade of islands and shoreline settlements, each with their own secrets and stories to tell, which takes the form of expertly-written text which occasionally lets you choose how you react to what you find. If you can imagine The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker was a visual novel with resource management set in a series of twisted British colonies, you'd be in the ballpark of describing the bulk of the Sunless Sea experience. Of course, it's the intriguing setting that makes you want to explore in the first place. The Unterzee itself is a strange, scary place that combines the unknowable dread of the works of Lovecraft with the diverse, normalized weirdness of Dungeons and Dragons' Planescape setting. London has sunk underneath the Earth's crust and serves as the principal port for the varied inhabitants and societies of the ocean below. Hell is real, and it just had a revolution to exile its aristocracy. Ships have the option of going to the surface, where human society still thrives, but their crews risk exposure from the sun, which can be deadly for inhabitants of the Unterzee (most of whom appear to be human themselves). Three mysterious, powerful beings are worshiped as gods of the zee--Stone, Salt, and Storm--but their influence is so vague and cryptic that you may not even know they're acting. Indeed, should you ever find yourself stranded without food or fuel, you can pray to one of them to give you a boon to tide you over until you make port. That doesn't mean they'll actually answer, mind. Or if they will even be kind rather than cruel. Even positive responses can be treacherous, as praying to Stone for fuel has been known to drop stalactites of coal from the ceiling, crushing crew members in the process. The rich, nuanced backdrop that the Unterzee provides is just begging players to explore its darkest corners. The real terror underneath this backdrop, though, is an elegant resource management game clashing against your desire to press your luck by pressing into the unknown further and further from London. Fuel and supplies are of extreme importance because if one of them depletes, it's game over. You'll also have to manage a third “resource”: terror. As you sail, you crew will get progressively more nervous about sailing the weird, treacherous waters. And the further you move from London, the quicker it will increase. Other actions you take in the text portions of the game will also increase or decrease this value. Should it ever hit 100, your crew will try to mutiny and will kill you if you don't calm them down. Returning to London will reset this value to 50 if you're already higher than that, encouraging you to return home every so often. Managing all three of these variables creates a nice tension during your voyage and really informs how far you want to venture out during each trek. And there's nothing like realizing you planned poorly for a voyage as you quickly scurry home, barely making it before your fuel bottoms out. But the big payoff in Sunless Sea is in the exploration. While you're scouring the zee and wiping out the black little by little from your sea chart, you'll often stumble across islands with ports you can stop at. Each one treats you to several different visual novel-like scenarios, many of which are tied to quests that grant echoes (the game's currency), fuel, supplies, or even different kinds of valuable artifacts or other assorted kinds of unknowable knowledge represented as items. The islands themselves all have their own stories to tell, and you'll feel compelled to unravel each and every one. And though it's thrilling to find out how all of these stories connect and intersect, the best by far are the ones that tell the stories of the societies themselves. One island, Visage, forces you to wear an animal mask and play the part it suggests while you're in the city proper--a frog mask indicates a bumbling tourist type. Playing your part correctly is more important than being polite or not being disruptive. Frog masks who aren't clumsy and thoughtless are immediately booted from the island. In this way, Visage speaks volumes about social interaction as performance and its role in determining identity. Another island, the Empire of Hands, is cultural appropriation taken to the extreme. It's made up of sentient apes obsessed with obtaining souls of their own so they can ""uplift"" themselves and take their places as humans' equals, even mimicking a melange of other cultures' structures and practices. Thing is, there's really no evidence that taking souls actually works, so it may just literally be a case of ""monkey see, monkey do."" Not all of the islands offer such fleshed-out cultures, but those that do isolate different aspects of our own culture and put them under a microscope. These transcendent moments inevitably fade, however, when you begin to grapple with the game's recursive structure. Dying doesn't end your journey, but rather initiates the beginning of a new captain's. You essentially start over with a new character, though you do get to carry over a portion of your previous captain's stats provided they were high enough as well as half of their Echoes, an officer, or their entire revealed seachart. And if you don't accept the latter, all the islands outside of the starting area are randomized and placed in completely different positions, forcing you to find them again. In this way, your journeys form a seafaring lineage of sorts equipped with the knowledge of past triumphs and mistakes, giving the game's structure a roguelike feel with a slight cushion whenever you bite the big one. The problem is this structure is a mismatch for Sunless Sea's slow pace. Exploring the zee is a very methodical process as you watch your ship slowly slide along the dark green water like a slug. Many quests involve you taking one or several doodads from one island to another, further limiting feelings of progression. Civilization without taking into account how quickly progression scales in them. You can go to zee for the joy of discovery and experience all you can so you can write your masterpiece, but you're put in an awkward position no matter how you position your new captain. If you start with a blank map, you'll have to spend each new start building up your resources again near home waters, which is time-consuming and monotonous. If you utilize a previous map, however, you don't get any new fragments--essentially experience--for landmarks you already discovered, which hamstrings progress towards meeting the prerequisites for victory. You need to cash in a large amount of secrets here (which let you level up stats, but also serve as a resource), which is awkward because you get a secret every time you get a certain amount of fragments and relying on a revealed map means not getting very many in that playthrough. Rather than creating interesting tension, these two scenarios just exacerbate the game's slow pace to intolerable levels. You can also win by acquiring a lot of money, but this victory condition sidesteps the most interesting parts of the game, instead pushing you to either care about finding the most profitable trade routes or find an exploitable, repeatable way to make some easy scratch. Finding your father's bones, which is the other victory condition, is by far the sanest way to experience Sunless Sea, which gives you a tangible main quest while also giving you the freedom to explore the Unterzee at your leisure. Groundhog Day where you have very little agency to change things. And though permadeath can be turned off in the settings, the game still encourages you to play many different captains so that you can reset all the quests and reap more rewards as you go when all you want to do is unravel the game's secrets you haven't yet discovered. Sunless Sea is an ambitious work that attempts to capture the sheer kinetic thrill of discovery in a bottle without the inevitable entropy of player completion depleting it, and falls well short. The promise of lengthened replayability only makes the methodical pace a joyless grind at times. But the things you're meant to discover truly defines the best of Sunless Sea. The stories you'll be able to tell from your journeys--that time you helped those rat mechanics defeat a bunch of guinea pig nobles; the creepy place you found yourself after sailing off the edge of the map; your continued struggles with managing your cannibalism--truly makes Sunless Sea a voyage worth taking for those with the patience to deal with the litany of structural issues. In asking how games can tap into our desire to discover, Sunless Sea proves that what we discover matters at least as much as how much we can discover."
1188,Sniper Elite 4,8.0,2,"This starts with the levels themselves. In Sniper Elite 3, Rebellion abandoned the linearity of previous series entries in favour of opening things up, and Sniper Elite 4 continues that trend in grand fashion. The smallest map in Sniper Elite 4 is three times the size of the largest one seen in its predecessor, and these expansive sandboxes are brimming with open-ended objectives you can choose to complete in any way you desire and in any order you please. They're varied locales, too, stretching across picturesque Italian landscapes on the verge of invasion: from the sunswept isolation of a cavernous island off the coast, to the narrow confines of an opulent beachfront town, to the dense overgrowth found in the heart of a verdant forest. Each one teeming with fascists just waiting to be extinguished with a well-placed bullet.And these massive playgrounds aren't just big for the sake of it; they grease the cogs of every other aspect of Sniper Elite 4's design. Collectibles and advantageous sniping positions are judiciously dotted around each map, encouraging you to explore, and the macabre satisfaction of sniping is increased tenfold when you're able to execute a pinpoint headshot from as far as 400 metres away. Sniper Elite's signature X-ray kills return in all their morbid glory here--now with even more detail--and it's a particular treat to see a bullet travel over these extensive distances before colliding with an enemy's skull, the hot lead bursting through eyeballs and sending a mixture of brain matter and skull fragments scattering onto the floor. This may sound tasteless, but the series' grisly ballistics are still second to none--and there's something wonderfully schlocky about rupturing an enemy's scrotum from 200 metres away.Getting into these fruitful sniping positions isn't the chore it once was either. There's a newfound responsiveness to protagonist Karl Fairburne's movement that makes it easier to get around and stay hidden. This polishing of the underlying mechanics makes tiptoeing across these mammoth spaces enjoyable in itself. There's a decent degree of verticality to each map, too, and you now have the ability to utilize it by clambering up specific surfaces, jumping across gaps, and climbing in and out of windows to navigate with increased freedom--not to mention the ability to wipe out a few enemies with some stealthy ledge takedowns. Environmental kills also play a part, whether it's a convenient red barrell or a rickety-looking bridge, and foliage is often a welcome aid to keep you out of sight from curious Nazi eyes.With the structure (or lack thereof) of its open-ended mission design, there's also a clear emphasis on experimentation. This is never more evident than with the two-pronged function of each item in your deep-pocketed arsenal. For distraction devices, this means you can switch between throwing rocks to lure enemies to a specific area, or a whistle that will bring them straight to you. Where it really gets fun, however, is with the bevy of explosives in your stockpile. Equip landmine, for example, and you can set it to detonate after one press or two. The former will see it explode the moment it's stood on, which is ideal for a single enemy; while the latter detonates after two steps, making it perfect for dealing with groups. Rig one up with two presses in, say, a doorway, and the delayed blast radius is liable to take out three or four enemies, rather than just the first guy to enter the room. Once you start booby trapping bodies, this devious feature really comes into its own.Personally, I have a soft spot for the sniper rifle's secondary function: suppressed rounds. These trade dramatic bullet drop-off for silent sniper fire, giving you the flexibility to use the game's standout feature with much more frequency. This was actually an issue in Sniper Elite 3, where it often felt like there were too few chances to use the sniper rifle without alerting everyone to your position, almost encouraging you to stick with the silenced pistol. There are still opportunities to mask the loud crack of your rifle with malfunctioning generators or the thundering noise of Luftwaffe flying overhead, which is the ideal way to silently pop skulls. But in areas where this isn't always possible, you now have the option to snipe with far more regularity, which is key in a game built around doing just that.If you are spotted and the bullets start flying, pulling out your Thompson and going toe-to-toe with the bloodthirsty fascists isn't as clunky or frustrating as it has been previously. There's a fluidity to the way the game shifts from stealth to action and then back again. And while its cover-based shooting is merely competent at best, its viability as a messy plan B for when things go awry is very much appreciated--which, once again, traces back to the size of the levels themselves. Every objective essentially occupies a pocket of space on these vast maps. Once you're inside one of these pockets, you can cause as much mayhem and destruction as you please, and the rest of the enemies dotted across the level will be none the wiser. This allows you to go in all guns blazing and savour each violent moment, safe in the knowledge that you won't have to worry about the rest of the mission being full of Nazis on high alert. It's a smart choice.The AI shows a marked improvement over its predecessors in situations similar to this. They'll attempt to triangulate your position based on the sound of gunfire, and officers will command their troops to overwhelm you if they have your location locked down. Inconsistency is a common menace, though, and they're not always the brightest bunch. There were a number of occasions where I would simply circle around an area after being spotted, only to find a bundle of enemies cowering behind cover near my last known position. With all of their backs turned, it was easy pickings. In other instances I've killed an enemy whose body is quickly discovered by one of his buddies. Naturally, I kill him while he's examining it, which garners the attention of another guard, and you can probably tell where I'm going with this. Guard after guard after guard; each one brazenly disregarding the growing pile of corpses to wade into my line of sight.If you want a harder challenge from the occasional bungling enemy, the “Authentic” difficulty setting strips away all of the handy assists and extends the life of the campaign with a steep learning curve. You'll probably want to skip all of the cutscenes a second time through, though. The plot is completely forgettable; a stereotypical World War II tale, with an unhinged Nazi villain, and a superweapon only our gruff American hero can stop. Some surface level details touch on the Italian resistance and the mafia's role in the war, but it never delves deep enough to be particularly enlightening or engaging as a story. Beyond the beautiful Italian landscapes, the setting isn't exploited as much as one might hope.Sniper Elite 4 feels like a natural progression for this series, as Rebellion continues to refine its systems and put a greater emphasis on the long-range shootingMultiplayer serves up a plethora of game modes spread across competitive and cooperative offerings. Control asks teams to battle for supremacy over an ever-moving control point, disregarding the sniper rifle in favour of some up-close-and-personal skirmishes. This sits in stark contrast to the rest of the competitive modes, which are predominantly marksman affairs. If you enjoy cautiously moving across maps with an eye open for the glint of an enemy scope, then there will be something here for you. I can't say I've ever regularly enjoyed sniping in multiplayer shooters, so entire matches based around this style of combat aren't for me. Killing a human player from the opposite side of a map is still immensely satisfying, but these moments are so few and far between, it was never enough to hold my attention for too long.Survival fares much better, as up to four players work together to withstand increasingly challenging waves of enemies-- à la Horde mode. As snipers, distance is a key advantage, and it's fun finding an opportune location to seek shelter and pick off each wave of progressively difficult Nazis. In a unique twist, the supply box you use to replenish your ammunition also moves to a different location every few waves, forcing you to get creative with your trap placement, and discover new areas to camp out. Once mortar fire, tanks, and heavily-armoured units rain down upon you, it can get incredibly tense.Sniper Elite 4 feels like a natural progression for this series, as Rebellion continues to refine its systems and put a greater emphasis on the long-range shooting it does so well. Its stealth and action mechanics may be simplistic, but they're functional and regularly enjoyable. And the maps--with their impressive scale, open-ended objectives, and clever level design--coalesce these disparate systems into a creative and fulfilling whole. There are still some issues with AI inconsistency, a bland story, and some dull competitive multiplayer, but it finally feels like this series is living up to its long-standing potential."
3379,Patrician IV: Conquest by Trade,6.0,1,"      In fact, nearly every problem in the world can be solved by moving goods to the right port or warehouse. A prince wants you to punish an uppity vassal? Just drag all of his meat and grain onto your convoys, and he'll starve. Like to improve your relations with a particular city? Drag and drop a heaping load of foreign goods onto its docks. Even courtship boils down to making sure you've stockpiled enough goods in your warehouse to pay for the wedding party. Of course, you could take a laissez-faire attitude toward the whole endeavor and just set up automated trade convoys, but then there will be precious little for you to do while waiting for profits to roll in. This isn't to say that there is no challenge to be had here. Patrician IV's economics can be surprisingly unforgiving; a few poorly planned purchases can be ruinous for your operation, making it relatively easy to dig yourself into an inescapable hole.           While things do get more amusing in the late game, you'll probably lose your enthusiasm en route. Although the merchants of the Hanseatic League have some degree of freedom, their existence is still defined by a rigid hierarchy, and if you want to get anywhere in this world, you have to continually amass more wealth, improve your standing in more cities, build counting houses, and expand your navy. As a result, prerequisites for missions become a major hassle at times. For example, Patrician IV will have you spend an hour carefully building up your rank so that you can embark on an expedition to Italy to buy spices, only to discover that you don't have the right ships in your fleet, and once that has been rectified, you learn that none of your ship captains are sufficiently experienced in navigation to make the trip. Why couldn't the guild tell you all of this when it sold you the rights to explore the Mediterranean?       "
2785,I Heart Geeks!,6.0,1,"  Efficiency be damned. When confronted by a balloon that needs to be popped, you could just squeeze the darn thing until helium bursts forth from an open orifice, but where would the fun be in that? By constructing an elaborate machine complete with candles, conveyor belts, and even electrical switches, you can take the time to give that balloon a proper send-off. I Heart Geeks revels in the concept of building elaborate machines to perform mundane tasks, and the rush you feel when you successfully link seemingly random pieces together to do your bidding taps into the inventor buried deep inside everyone. But that simple pleasure is often displaced by poor help implementation and an assortment of tools that rarely excite the imagination. I Heart Geeks struggles to maintain its puzzling appeal, resulting in a tired exercise in mechanical tomfoolery.        In between the puzzle solving that makes up the majority of the experience, I Heart Geeks features a cursory story to explain why you're performing such odd activities in the first place. You follow a group of geeks (an enterprise?) as they try to turn the tables on the bullies who have tormented them through the years. It's a concept that could have been fun to see played out in vignettes if the material were good, but there are few clever ideas to keep you interested in the geeks' rise to overthrow their oppressors. Granted, the plot is only a small aspect of this game, but this lack of creative spark trickles down to every other element. From the bland artistic style and repetitive score to the predictable tools you work with, I Heart Geeks achieves the bare minimum similar games have reached while offering few noteworthy elements to separate it from the pack.      The rules are easy to learn. A set of immovable objects is located on the top screen, and you have to move the items located in your lower screen inventory beside them to solve a conundrum. Inventory items are chosen for you beforehand, and most of the levels are designed so you make use of your entire repertoire, though imaginative tinkering can let you pass with a bit of flair. In the early going, objectives stray toward the easy side to ease you in gracefully. You may have to lay out wooden planks or a spring pad so a ball can reach a box on the other side of the level, and there isn't a time limit rushing you through the process. You can take your time surveying the level, deliberately placing items using the touch screen, and then set things in motion so you can see how the items interact. Make a mistake? It's easy enough to tweak the items you placed, so simple trial and error is enough to solve most puzzles. You're ultimately graded on how quickly you finish each puzzle, but because there's no online integration, you won't be able to see how you rank against the best builders in the world.             The single-player game stretches on for more than 100 mind-bending stages, and you can challenge a buddy to some head-to-head action on those same puzzles if you want to prove just how fast you are. It's a weak multiplayer mode considering that the levels are recycled and you still need two separate cartridges, so it doesn't add much longevity to the package. I Heart Geeks is overpriced at $30, considering the wealth of similar and far cheaper games out there, and it doesn't warrant the higher price tag in the slightest. Predictable items fail to make the puzzles exciting, and the ho-hum aesthetics hardly mask the other issues. Solving a tricky puzzle is still satisfying, but you'll have more fun trying to pop a balloon in real life than crafting contraptions in I Heart Geeks.   "
828,The Bard's Tale IV: Barrows Deep,4.0,0,"InXile Entertainment's resurrection of this long-lost series from the age of Ronald Reagan and Max Headroom takes the role-playing genre back in time for better and worse. The Bard's Tale IV: Barrows Deep's visuals are a charmingly nostalgic reminder of the origins of 3D role-playing games, but most of the game's features are too outdated to hold up to today's standards.Actually, the first challenge here is remembering what the Bard's Tale franchise is all about. The plot is supposed to follow 1988's The Bard's Tale III: Thief of Fate, although most of us will have to take their word for it given the 30 years between major franchise installments. Skara Brae and a rogues' gallery of familiar villains from the original Bard's Tale trilogy are the main hallmarks here, along with new live-action cutscenes that brings to life the iconic cover art from those '80s RPG classics. They are beyond cheesy, but these clips provide plenty of old-school atmosphere.Other shout-outs to RPG history are evident in the core design, which is minimalistic by comparison to modern role-players. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the straightforward character development and combat systems are easy to learn. Your group is depicted via portraits in the ""party bar"" along the bottom eight slots (for the six party-member maximum plus two for summoned allies) on the screen. Movement is handled fluidly with the party being directed as one in real time while exploring. Encountering enemies switches the game over to turn-based combat where you give orders to attack, cast spells, and so forth based on objective and spell points. Overall, it's a tried-and-true system for a retro RPG experience, especially if you want something basic.But with that said, Bard's Tale IV is too simplistic. Characters come with just four core stats (strength, constitution, armor class, and intelligence) that can basically only be adjusted with equipment and skills earned when leveling up. If you want to raise your constitution (which functions here as hit points, unlike a more traditional D&amp;D system), for example, you need to put on armor, wield a bonus-granting weapon, or take a skill that gives a corresponding buff.Serious customization is hard to come by. There aren't a lot of character choices provided beyond standard fantasy races like humans, elves, dwarves, and the goblin-like trow, and classes like fighters, practitioners (mages), rogues, and bards. Bards do feel somewhat unique due to their ability to power skills and magic in battle by chugging booze. Leveling up provides some ability to tweak your heroes, but choice is limited because you're allocated just a single point with each advancement to distribute among the four skill treesCombat has a narrow focus. A handful of objective and spell points are given to the party to use collectively each turn, and you have to spend them on just four selected skill masteries from your overall pool of abilities. Attacks always hit, so strategizing involves looking through each hero's masteries, choosing what does the most damage, and deciding on the best enemy target. You can deal physical damage via melee and ranged attacks or mental damage via spells.Masteries deal with one type of damage or the other, which causes problems as there is no way to switch them up once a battle has begun. As a result, readied masteries regularly don't match up with what enemies bring to the table. For example, heavily armored foes are vulnerable to mental damage, but if your ready-to-go masteries don't have enough mental attacks, you're out of luck. You can try to build a balanced party, but many masteries aren't shared across classes, so there's not a great range of options if you want a group that's prepared for everything. Because of that, combat feels gimmicky, with you failing at times through no fault other than not guessing what the game is about to throw your way.The one positive aspect of combat--and it's a positive with definite drawbacks--is that every region is populated with the same four or fives types of enemy. So once you take on the first mob of goblin fire archers, cultist sorcerers, skeletons, assassins, or whatever in a particular location, you know what to expect in that entire area and can go on autopilot when it comes to battle strategizing. Enemies help out by not being very bright, either. They waste their own objective points on moving around unnecessarily, do nothing in the back row, ignore wounded heroes and threats like spellcasters, and so on.Surprises still happen, though. Difficulty jumps around. You can be steamrolling all comers for ages and walk into a brutal fight against an all-new creature with a never-before-seen ability like regeneration, or undead that revive unless you send them all back to the afterlife in one turn. You learn how to fight different creatures as they appear, but because there's no save-on-demand feature--you instead save at totems strewn around the landscape--this can lead to frustrating trial and error.Making matters worse is the inaccuracy of the enemy warning system. Look at a mob of foes and they highlight green, yellow, or red. To try to make matters even clearer, party members chime in by assessing the potential bout as a cakewalk, a challenge, or suicide. None of this is very accurate, though. While green scraps always seem easy, some yellow are murderous, and some red are a lot more painless than expected. As a result, you can get a nasty shocker and get killed in a fight that looks like no problem--which is a major pain if you haven't been able to save in a while.Stability is a also problem. Crashes are a frequent occurrence, especially at the end of battles. Usually the game went down with an error message, but a few times it froze up at the end of a fight while looking at the loot that dead foes left behind. Because of these crashes, it's wise to save constantly--even when you have to run back significant distances to find a save totem after a tough battle.More serious issues arise due to problems with the level design and structure of the game's locales. The maps are huge and labyrinthine and that's befitting the history of dungeon crawlers, of course, but the game is too loaded with narrow corridors with minimal incentives. Despite the maze-like appearance, you are led in a linear fashion from Point A to Point B in the dungeon ruins of Skara Brae, the forest of Inshriach, or the tundra of Stronsea. There is little room for creativity, as both plot and maps run on rails from start to finish. Inaccessible areas are crudely blocked off with rubble or piles of crates, as well, reinforcing the feeling that you're playing a game of connect-the-dots with extra steps.While there is a good variety of brainteasers in the game, ranging from switching gears to moving blocks to shoving faeries around an obstacle course to routing blood into connected streams, there are far, far too many of them. Puzzles are used to pad out levels too often. Instead of having to face one or two of these innovative enigmas at a time, you get five or more in a row, almost always of the same type, which gets very monotonous, very fast.Aspects of the map design appear unfinished. While loads of NPCs are ready to chat, these encounters generally lead to dead ends. Some wayward monk or lovelorn peasant will tell you a story of woe that seems to be leading somewhere, as their conversations tend to revolve around boilerplate RPG quests like hunting for an artifact or finding a lost girlfriend. But then these talks either come to an abrupt halt or the guy or gal turns into a merchant. Your only response to somebody pouring their heart a lot of the time is to ask if they've got any stuff to sell.Most areas offer little beyond solving puzzles and fighting. Loot drops are limited. You collect the same swords, helmets, and armor constantly from defeated enemies and the crates and barrels scattered across the landscape, along with various types of food and drink that both recover hit points and can be used in crafting. There is little sense of reward. For every cool sword you discover, you smash open 50 barrels and chests filled with vegetables and bottles of water. There's nothing like taking 10 minutes to solve a puzzle leading to a chest…and then finding nothing in it but three carrots and a potato.The visuals aren't technically impressive and cause even the best systems to chug and stutter when moving the camera on all graphics settings. Character faces have an oddly disturbing appearance in the middle ground between a mannequin and a melted candle, and animations are stiff and jerky, both in real-time dungeon delving and in turn-based battles. Still, the look of the game remains charming. Everything is given a Celtic/Scottish look that could have been taken from Braveheart, and a bright color palette evokes an '80s RPG mood recalling the vivid hues of classic D&amp;D art.Audio is hit and miss. Well-acted dialogue perfectly handles the Scottish brogue of most characters. Enemies repeat cheesy taunts in combat, though, and party chatter consists of juvenile insults. Some audio effects don't fit with what's taking place on-screen. Gulping down water triggers the same crunching and lip-smacking that accompanies eating a cabbage or apple. At least the music has a beautiful Celtic flavor with plucked strings, fiddles, and choral odes that make the game sound like Enya outtakes.Other quirks add aggravation. Load times are long and frequent; it takes over a minute to transition between areas, even when leaving a tavern to hit the streets. Level maps can be misleading. Key items like save totems aren't included, and you can't make notes. There is no way to sort character inventories, leading to tedious item management.Common wisdom and clichés aside, The Bard's Tale IV: Barrows Deep proves you can go home again. But why would anyone want to? While the game re-creates what we played in the 1990s, misty water-colored memories of hours spent with Eye of the Beholder are not enough to fix numerous design miscues, performance problems, and bugs. This is a tough sell to all but the most dedicated and patient retro fan."
3283,Ys: The Oath in Felghana,8.0,2,"     Felghana is a small nation bordered by mountains and sea; it is isolated but rich in the valuable and unique raval ore. Its people have been governed for the past 20 years by an appointee of the Romun Empire, Count McGuire, a harsh master who treats his charges cruelly through taxation without representation and who issues all manner of strange edicts. The region is also the birthplace of Dogi, Adol's muscular companion, so when the pair hears of a disturbance in Felghana, nothing will do but to sail right over and investigate. A large cast of locals and other characters helps bring the tale to life with screen-grabbing, sizeable character portraits and quite a lot of voice acting. A focus on vocal storytelling means that Adol's actions (which are always referred to via the third person) are relayed through the warm tones of a narrator, and this technique goes a long way in aiding the flow of dialogue. It helps integrate the sometimes jarring juxtaposition of live conversations interspersed with phrases like, ""Adol nods and offers his aid,"" making it clear that this is an after-the-fact account of the travels of an outrageously famous hero. It's still typical Ys fare that concentrates on vanquishing foes rather than focusing on its narrative journey, but all the extra personality helps to build out the world in a more nuanced way, even when some of the acting tends to be a bit hokey. The great soundtrack, driven by elements of rock, as well as some more traditional orchestral melodies, rounds out the audio and provides an energetic atmosphere.                "
155,NBA 2K23,8.0,2,"I've never envied the development cycle that comes with working on an annual sports game series. When you consider how much time and money goes into any other big-budget project, asking a studio to constantly churn out a game that is both functional and consistent but also fresh and exciting every single year seems unfair. NBA 2K23 is incredibly impressive regardless, but even moreso in light of this tight dev cycle. With a deep suite of fun game modes, improved on-court gameplay, and a deeper social experience, it feels like the team at Visual Concepts managed to freeze time and spend longer than the typical cycle on this exceptional NBA sim.It's hard to know where to begin with NBA 2K23 because, in ways both big and small, there's a lot of new stuff to see. For me, though, it starts with The Jordan Challenge. For the first time since NBA 2K11, you can relive highlights from the career of the greatest player in NBA history. More than just a rehash of a mode absent for over a decade, this renewed Jordan Challenge is like a modern remake of that original concept.Beginning in his college career at North Carolina, you'll play through 15 of Jordan's biggest games and work to recreate statlines and other outcomes like a time traveler seeking to not disrupt the proper timeline. Where Jordan dropped 63 on the Celtics and set a playoff scoring record, now so can you. Where he won his sixth and final NBA title, you too can perform his last dance. These and other forever-on-replay basketball moments are yours to relive.Conceptually, this is as it was before, albeit now with five more games than the original iteration, but the finer details are where The Jordan Challenge really shines in 2K23. Era-appropriate filters, retro on-screen graphics, and even long-gone arenas and fittingly-dressed spectators work together to transport players to the time and place of each game spanning the '80s and '90s. Before each game, the Visual Concepts team includes new interview segments with players, commentators, coaches, and others who witnessed the greatness of Michael Jordan firsthand. Collectively, it gives the whole mode the feeling of an interactive museum to unrivaled basketball achievements, and playing it has been the first time in my life that a sports game gave me goosebumps.This allows you to position your team to draft or trade for the contemporary or incoming stars of each era and recreate basketball history from that starting point, like creating alternate realities where Larry Bird played for Philly or Jordan never retired for two years in the middle of his prime. The league will change as you go, too, with rulebooks getting updates, dominant play styles changing over the years, and teams relocating--or not, if you decide your NBA alt-universe keeps the Sonics where they belong, for example.Both The Jordan Challenge and this new MyNBA feature, called Eras, represent ways this year's game feels like it goes above and beyond. Other sports sims just aren't offering this type of content for their players. It's a remarkable thing and feels handled with care and attention from a studio that must be full of real basketball fanatics. The love of the game is pouring out of these two modes and would merely by themselves qualify NBA 2K23 as a must-play for basketball fans.Though these marquee features are by no means small, NBA 2K has long been a series that sweats the small stuff, too. Wildly lifelike player animations, best-in-class commentary, and unmatched broadcast-style presentation all return with impressive added touches, like different commentary teams depending on which mode you're playing. NBA 2K has long put some other sports series--which I won't name, but you can probably guess--to shame with such attention to detail, and these little things have an outsized effect in the end, making this series the most enjoyable sports game every single year.Those touches separate this series from the pack even when NBA 2K itself was sometimes lacking in the actual basketball gameplay, but concerns regarding last year's overemphasis on shooting have been addressed. Though the NBA itself generally favors the three-ball in real life, that's not the case for all players, of course. But last year's game made sharpshooters out of anyone with an open look. It was unrealistic and altered what is arguably the most important aspect: online pick-up games with friends and rivals. 2K23 focuses largely on giving power back to the strong finishers and slashers of the league, preventing back-to-back years where everyone looks like Steph Curry.Modeled after the play of Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo, this year's game feels better balanced right away for different play styles. Those who aren't natural shooters have regressed to something more realistic, while those who lean into the paint and bully defenders now feel just as dominant as a shooter from behind the arc. In turn, this has made online PvP games more enjoyable, as they no longer feel like three-point contests.Knowing that, the team has designed this year's game to give you narrative reasons for running around The City completing quests for dozens of NPCs like it's an RPG. You'll be winning over districts of fans like a San Andreas turf war, but here your weapons will be charity work, endorsement deals, and the occasional viral tweet.After years of The City (and its predecessor, The Neighborhood), the mode still feels like an accomplishment. Like The Jordan Challenge and MyNBA Eras, this social hub is something only NBA 2K is doing and helps separate it from the rest of the pack, making it easy for fans of multiple sports games to know where to invest their time with tons of modes and attractions, some of them rotating in on a daily basis. The big new addition is The Theater, which is the place to head for limited-time modes with oddball changes to scoring or the rulebooks. The City does return a few nagging issues, however.First worth mentioning are the game's modes of transportation. For those who don't want to run from quest to court and vice versa, skateboards and bikes are back, but they control so poorly--and always have--that I'm more likely to stay on foot and accept the speed decrease. Thankfully, new fast-travel points have been added in the form of subway stations and this year's city is actually about 30% smaller due to fan demand for a more dense cityscape. Still, both quests and travel distances will sometimes call for using skateboards, but they're frustratingly unwieldy. It's odd to complain about a basketball game's skateboarding mechanics, but it's a choice to include this kind of stuff, and this year's game has not resolved this long-standing issue.If you're not new to the series, you likely already know how invasive the microtransactions (MTX) are. Even at its past heights, the pay model has been the thing taking this series down a peg or two, and it's still an issue here. The problem is twofold. On one hand, the game's MyTeam mode is just as bad as any comparable mode such as Ultimate Team in EA Sports games. It's pay-to-win, without a doubt, given how any player can simply buy up unlimited card packs until they've landed a dominant team. But the game's MTX continue to dampen The City, too, as the same Virtual Currency that can upgrade your squad in MyTeam can also dramatically improve your MyPlayer protagonist too.As that player eventually migrates out of the story and into The City, it causes a MyTeam-like rift between those who grind for greatness and those who paid their way up the ranks. It's clear some percentage of players may prefer the game lets them upgrade right away, but then to have to face them in The City's courts and other PvP modes feels like getting stuck in a first-person shooter lobby with wall-hackers and aimbotters. Making it so the same currency buys tattoos, repaints skateboards, and upgrades your player feels like a long-broken feature that the game just keeps returning to each September.The City is also smothered by product placement in a way that is so over-the-top it would be hilarious if it wasn't giving me such a dark preview of the so-called metaverse. Virtually everything is a commercial, from Gatorade and Nike to Mobil and Nokia. It feels like I can't even high-five a teammate without it being brought to me by Mountain Dew.These issues, especially due to their persistence year after year, do hinder NBA 2K23 from being historically great, but for annual players who have gotten used to these problems, they'll likely sting less. What remains after you forgive (or just try to forget) those issues is undoubtedly still an exceptional basketball game made with an intense attention to detail and a love of the game. On the court, NBA 2K23 looks and feels lifelike and exciting in every drive, and the new and revamped modes treat the NBA like a revered historical monument. In those important ways it does its best to reflect Jordan's greatness and shows both NBA newcomers and historians what it's like to play like Mike."
488,Necrobarista,7.0,2,"As it's a visual novel, there's not much in terms of gameplay when it comes to Necrobarista. Your primary means of understanding its world is by reading its story, which is told in a slice-of-life format that provides a quick snippet of the daily goings-on inside a Melbourne-based cafe called Terminal over the course of several days. Terminal exists on an in-between plane (it's technically a part of the living world but it exists as a potential stopping point before the afterlife), allowing both the living and the dead to wander through its doors. The dead are only permitted to stay 24 hours before Terminal staff must encourage them to move on to the afterlife--whether that's heaven, hell, or something else entirely is unknown as no one has ever come back from it. The dead who stay longer than 24 hours begin upsetting the balance of the universe, which runs up a tab that the cafe has to then pay off. At the start of Necrobarista, the cafe has recently been passed down from immortal necromancer Chay to his protege, Maddy, along with several centuries' worth of debt.Though Maddy is the clear stand-out, this type of characterization is extended to the other main characters you see in Terminal. Though he no longer owns the cafe, Chay sticks around to continue teaching Maddy as well as take care of 13-year-old Ashley, a gifted robotics genius. There's also Ned, Chay's oldest friend and the gruff enforcer tasked with ensuring the Terminal staff ultimately pays its debt. And then there's Kishan, a recently departed soul who wanders into Terminal at the start of the story--thankfully existing as the clueless newbie who has all the same questions that we do and acts as our voice of confusion whenever Necrobarista starts diving into the nitty-gritty of its world.Necrobarista doesn't actually put you into the perspective of any of these characters. Instead, you exist as this passive observer that watches conversations play out. This does keep some of the game's best reveals a secret until the mic is actually dropped, as you are not privy to any of the internal thoughts or feelings of the characters until they're spoken out loud. But it does create an unwelcome disconnect in the story. I feel sympathy for Kishan struggling to deal with the realization that he only has 24 hours left before he must move on, for Maddy turning to less-than-legal means in order to overcome the tremendous debt that's been dropped on her, and for Ned feeling forced to be the bearer of bad news when he's just a cog in a bureaucratic machine. But I don't empathize with any of them--these are their plights for me to see, not necessarily care about or act on.Granted, visual novels traditionally don't rely on the same unique strengths of other video game genres, but in this case the impartial disconnect is a hindrance to Necrobarista's story. The game is only five hours long, and that first hour is difficult to get through because there's nothing drawing you in. You're just watching strangers talk to one another. But mid-way through chapter three, Necrobarista begins to dive into the existing and developing relationships between these strangers, and it's in that insight that you can begin to care. I don't much care that Kishan is struggling with his mortality at first--he's just some guy--but once he bonds with Ashley and Maddy and I can see how his leaving would affect them, I care. I don't care for myself--he's still a stranger--but I can see how important he is to the other characters and even as an observer I can empathize with that feeling. In this way, Necrobarista loses something in its attempts to normalize the concepts of dying and grieving and talking about lost loved ones. I see the characters go through the growth, but their transformation is lost on me and I can't help but feel left out by the time the credits roll, like I'm missing something important that everyone else understands.Don't get me wrong, I really like the story told in Necrobarista. It's got wonderful comedic timing, which is made all the better through the small cinematics between each line of dialogue--my computer is filled with screenshots of the dozens of moments where I had to stop playing because I was laughing at whatever joke, pun, or deadpan stare was playing out on screen. I can't actually share many of these with y'all (even though I very much want to) because they'd spoil some of Necrobarista's best moments. There are some touching moments in the game as well, especially towards the end, and their juxtaposition against the rest of the story's humorous tone results in a satisfyingly bittersweet conclusion. Death and grief aren't traditionally happy things to talk about, and Necrobarista doesn't try to change that--it merely puts forward that the people in its story should be okay with talking about their feelings surrounding their mortality and then nails the execution.Necrobarista isn't all reading, though; there is a bit of interactivity, as certain words will be highlighted and clicking on them will reveal some hidden insight into that word. Perhaps the term is in reference to an unspoken detail about the speaker's backstory, for example, or a piece of jargon that reveals additional insight into the lore of Necrobarista's world.At the end of each chapter, all of the highlighted words will appear on screen regardless of whether you clicked on them or not. Without providing context for how the words are used, the game then tasks you with picking seven you wish to highlight to see what each corresponds to. For instance, a word that was used in reference to Necrobarista's Melbourne setting will provide you a fragment point towards ""Melbourne"" while one in regards to mortality will award one for ""Death."" Between each chapter, you're allowed to explore the cafe where Necrobarista's story takes place and interact with certain objects in order to unlock side stories that further flesh out the characters you meet and overall lore. However, to unlock these side stories, you'll need a certain amount of points in specific categories. Rotten Poppy, for example, requires you have fragment points for Terminal, Maddy, and Chay so you need to remember to pick words related to the cafe and the two characters in order to unlock it.There's too much guesswork involved with this, especially if you're like me and have a poor memory. For a while, I tried notetaking, but the process drew me out of the story every time a highlighted word popped up and I had to stop to write down the context. And even when taking notes, you still need to make an educated guess when it comes to certain words--is a word made in reference to Keshin's soon-to-be demise alluding to him or to the general concept of death itself? In the end, there's no feeling of success for picking out the right words to unlock a new side story, it's about as satisfying as guessing the right answers to a multiple-choice test.Not every side story is interesting, either. Some, like Rotten Poppy, which recounts the memory of Maddy and Chay arguing over whether poppy seeds are worthless, are hilarious. But there are a few, such as the list of product reviews for cups in Crucible Product Reviews, that are pretty boring. Given that these side stories can be so hit-or-miss, I gave up on trying to unlock them about halfway through the main campaign. If I happened to guess enough of the right words to unlock a new side story, I'd read through it, but I don't feel compelled to replay any of Necrobarista's chapters in order to earn the necessary points for unlocking them all. If anything, I'd replay Necrobarista just to experience its wonderful main story again.As a final note: I need to talk about how much I love Necrobarista's aesthetic, which goes a long way towards telling its story. I've already mentioned how the 3D cinematic art style helps to both further characterize the cast through movement and detailed facial expressions as well as set up the timing for some of the game's best jokes, but the music contributes to the game's overall tone too. With no spoken dialogue and very few sound effects, the game's soundtrack is pretty much all you hear throughout the entire game, making it just as instrumental (heh) as the visuals to conveying unspoken information. Composer Kevin Penkin sets the stage for Terminal with this soft and yet haunting use of piano in ""Confluence,"" the main theme that plays in most scenes. It sets this relaxing baseline for the game, so it's especially noticeable when a dramatic scene sees all music momentarily stop or a more lighthearted one incorporates an energetic composition. And the song played in Necrobarista's anime-like OP cutscene? Straight banger.The actual gameplay aspects of Necrobarista aren't all that satisfying, but the game more than makes up for that by leaning into the ""novel"" part of the visual novel genre and crafting a bittersweet story about accepting death, learning to grieve, and moving on. That isn't to say the game slouches on the ""visual"" part either--its 3D cinematic style adds plenty of unspoken characterization and also better sells the witty writing with some excellent comedic timing. I can't help but feel like all the characters I fell in love with got to go on an awesome journey while I just had to sit there and watch, but the overall themes and storybeats still hit pretty hard as a passive observer."
4246,The Weakest Link,4.0,0," What is it about Anne Robinson, host of the British-import quiz show The Weakest Link, that makes her appealing? Her flowing trench coat and constant sneer immediately conjure images of Orwell's 1984, and the wittiness of the insults she directs at losing contestants is dulled by their harshness. While her show is a hit in the UK, it's not doing quite as well here in the States as NBC execs had hoped. The recent rash of celebrity players instead of common contestants is a sure sign that someone at the top knows the show needs a shot in the arm. Activision's PC game adaptation of the show could have also benefited from some more attention. It doesn't take someone with a master's degree in marketing to know that people who don't like the show won't buy the game. But the truth is that so little has been done to jazz up the game's presentation that only those who long to hear more abuse spew from Anne Robinson's curled lips will find enough here to justify spending 20 bucks.Things get off to a shaky start with the introduction, a hiss-filled FMV sequence that concludes with a truly scary image of Robinson's face filling the monitor as she spits out, ""I will tell the world you are...the weakest link!"" This is the first of seemingly dozens of times you'll hear that phrase during a game session. You have the option to tweak a few game parameters: You can assume total responsibility for banking winnings, adjust how often questions from each of the five categories appear, and choose whether or not you want to see an especially abusive video clip from Anne Robinson should you be chosen as the weakest link. Incidentally, all the FMV clips are just as hiss-filled as the intro.Whether you choose a single game or the championship mode (in which you must win four consecutive shows in a bid to ""win"" $50 million), you compete against six computer-controlled opponents out of a pool of two dozen. Each specializes in several of the categories and reacts in accordance with his or her bio, which given in the manual. For instance, the computer programmer says nerdy programmer types of things like, ""His download time appears to be far too long,"" and, ""She must have suffered a system crash during that round."" Such embarrassingly unfunny lines don't do much to help the game.Though the manual says The Weakest Link computer game ""plays exactly as the television show,"" that's simply not possible. Even the harshest critic wouldn't expect Robinson to actually record 100,000 different questions (the game box claims 100,000 questions are included), and of course there's the issue of how the software would recognize the specific answers generated by the user. Instead, each question is displayed onscreen as Robinson repeats several generic lines such as, ""In nature, which one of these is correct?"" or ""Select the correct answer."" You're then given a choice of four answers with only the first letter (sometimes first two letters) of each displayed. Your choices of actions are the same as in the show: You can bank any team winnings to a safe repository before answering, attempt to answer the question correctly and increase the value of the next question, or pass on the question. Pass is a rather worthless option, since it causes any money that hasn't been banked to be lost--the same result as answering incorrectly.While isn't exactly the same as the show, it's awfully close--and there's the rub. Watching a TV show is a passive experience, a quality you don't want in an interactive game. Waiting for your question is boring enough, especially at the start of a game, when there are six other players, but the real kicker is the dead time between the six rounds. Between two and two-and-a-half minutes are spent on voting off the weakest player. These sequences are filled with player remarks and Robinson's barbs, and there's not a thing you can do to speed up the process. You can pound the space bar and jab the Esc key all you like, but if you want to finish that game, you'll have to sit through this stuff between every round. In short, you spend more time watching than playing--never a good quality in a PC game.As for the alleged inclusion of 100,000 different questions, you'll likely find that hard to believe. We not only experienced question repeats within just three games, but we also saw different questions about the same topic during the same round of questions--two King Kong questions within 30 seconds.In all, the single-player game can be interesting for several hours, unless you're an Anne Robinson maniac who doesn't mind hearing the same remarks over and over after that. The multiplayer mode should give the game some replay value, but it's limited because only hot-seat play is supported--there's no way to play online, over a network, or via modem. Multiplayer is also a bit clunky because only programmable gamepads can be used for both selecting and answering questions. You can use the D-pad to select one of the answers and have a friend hit the space bar for you, however.But the biggest drawback to hot-seat multiplayer in The Weakest Link is obvious: This isn't the sort of game you want to play with friends. It's one thing to gang up with others to vote out a weak player on a game show where you could walk out rich (or watch strangers doing that as you relax in your living room), but doing it with friends simply isn't very rewarding. In short, it just doesn't have the same social appeal as more conventional competitive quiz games like Trivial Pursuit or You Don't Know Jack.The Weakest Link's $19.95 retail price could have been tempting if you were able to play the game online, because online play is the only feature that could have made the game more than a novelty. In the end, only those who like collecting anything to do with a show that probably won't last more than a season or two in the States should seriously consider The Weakest Link.  "
3822,Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity,5.0,1,"  No. In Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity, it still doesn't make sense that Sonic the Hedgehog would need to race upon a hoverboard. That's like Cyclops from the X-Men buying a laser gun, or Iceman needing a snow cone. And even though there are a couple of speedy thrills, with a two-hour campaign, an overbearing plot, and lame course design, you need this hoverboard racer about as much as Wolverine needs a new set of Ginsu knives.     The story is obviously ludicrous. After all, at their core, Sonic games have always been about the battle between a talking hedgehog in sneakers and a fat, mad scientist. But Zero Gravity is ludicrous in unexpected ways. The game begins with a rampage (ripped straight out of I, Robot) in which Sonic and company are caught in the middle when an ancient artifact they stumble upon turns out to be a prized possession of the robots' mother. The team investigates and quickly crosses paths with Dr. Robotnik, who swears he has nothing to do with the calamity, to which Sonic says ""Well I guess for now we'll have to buy that Eggman isn't involved.""         Yes, it's that head-slappingly stupid. Even worse, when you finally discover that Eggman is involved, it's revealed that the reason he's trying to gather the artifacts and stop the robots from rampaging is so that he can...cause the robots to rampage. But wait, it gets worse. The artifacts are part of this crazy legend involving the Babylon Rogues (a rival hoverboarding team comprised of, what else, birds), and they eventually lead you to a place referred to as ""The Crimson Tower,"" which is, of course, blue.      Not only are the plot and dialog bad even by Sonic standards, but you also have to sit through huge chunks of this garbage every time you complete a race. Ironically, the story mode itself is very short and takes only about two hours to beat. You simply jam through a handful of courses, bang your head against whatever hard object is nearby during the cutscenes, and then, suddenly, the credits roll. After that, your only option is to race through the same levels in survival mode, time attack or world grand prix mode, which earns you credits to purchase ""extreme gear.""      The racing itself is all over the place. The basic controls have you pressing forward on the L-stick for thrust, and moving it side to side to turn. If you need to make a really sharp turn, you can hold a button that slows you down but lets you rotate freely. Once you're pointing in the direction you want to go, you release the button and burst off, as if you were fired from a slingshot. This is an interesting mechanic that is put to creative use only in one level, where you must make hairpin turns over a cliff. The only way to pull one off has you actually hanging in space when you go off the turn, after which you dash back onto the road. It's thrilling when it works, but it works only half the time. You're just as likely to shoot yourself down into the abyss, or up into the ceiling, which is somehow also deadly.      Furthermore, slingshot turns are complicated in that they use energy points. These are accumulated when you make jumps. Jumping is simply a matter of hitting a button as you go off of a ramp. The later you hit the button, the more energy points you get. These can be spent on either turns or dashes. If you dash, you move much faster, and actually gain additional speed by running into objects (you didn't misread that). However, if you use all your energy on a dash, you'll eventually come to a tight corner, attempt to jump turn, and be stopped dead in your tracks because you were out of juice. Lots of games penalize you for overusing boost, but none this obtusely.     Speaking of obtuse, brace yourself for this next bit about hoverboard power-ups and shortcuts. You see, every board has its own selection of abilities that can be activated in each race if you collect enough rings, which are scattered throughout every course. These powers don't carry over from race to race.      But rather than catalog them all, we'll focus on three: grind, wheel, and air. Each of these powers correlates to a type of shortcut. If you can grind, the rails are open to you. All you have to do is jump on one and you're on your way. With wheel, you can crash through obstacle-laden detours. However, the wheel is generally terrible, and its shortcuts are the worst. And if you have the air, you can fly off of a ramp, through three rings, and past your competition. Although the concept of three different types of shortcuts is interesting, none of them are much fun in practice, and they sometimes take longer than the normal route.        The graphics are mostly fine, and in a couple of spots, the game manages to convey a real sense of speed. The sounds aren't bad either. Some of the music is catchy, and it's nice that the characters talk smack every time you pass a rival.      Nevertheless, the game's overall lack of content makes it one of the last things you'd want to spend 40 bucks on. Even though it manages to capture the occasional burst of Sonic speed, there isn't enough content in Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity to keep you entertained for more than two or three laps.   "
4110,The Godfather II,4.0,0,"  If The Godfather II had been a mediocre, mindless action flick, the game of the same name could at least be considered faithful to its source material. As it is, though, Coppola's Mafia-themed masterpiece has been reduced to an uninspired, repetitive open-world action game with out-of-context movie quotes and a handful of recognizable characters sprinkled throughout its forgettable story. To make matters worse, The Godfather II has clearly been released in an unfinished state and is riddled with performance issues and bugs like they've been fired from a Tommy gun.     You play as Dominic, an important member of the Corleone family who somehow managed to make it through the epic movie trilogy without ever wandering into camera shot despite apparently being involved in a number of key scenes. As one of Michael Corleone's most trusted men, you've been groomed to head up your own family, and after a brief introductory sequence set in Cuba, the game proper gets under way in a diminutive New York where you're instructed to set about making a name for yourself. From this point on, much of your time is spent seizing and attempting to retain control of businesses run by rival families in order to make money and, ultimately, force said families to retreat into their compounds where you can eliminate them entirely. Unfortunately, killing rival mafiosi and intimidating business owners gets repetitive quickly and isn't much fun to begin with.        That's largely because the gunplay in The Godfather II is neither challenging nor satisfying. You have an impressive arsenal at your disposal, and weapons like the Magnum and the shotgun really feel like they pack a punch, but the enemies you're using them against rarely seem too interested in self-preservation. Too many of them simply stand their ground or charge at you and, if they somehow manage to get close before you put a couple of bullets in their heads, can easily be grabbed, punched, strangled, or head-butted into the afterlife. With that said, the made men working for rival families are geniuses compared to the clowns you get to recruit into your own family. They have their uses, but even having them do something as simple as walk through a doorway ahead of you or climb into one of the game's many slow but slippery cars with you can take some work. Predictably, things don't get any better when they're put into combat situations or are asked to perform the very specific tasks that they supposedly each specialize in, which include cracking safes, committing arson, and kicking down doors.     The problem isn't that they're unable to perform those tasks; it's that walking from A to B is rarely straightforward for them. When they're not failing to get into cars with you or running rings around one another at superhuman speeds, your guys can often be observed wandering off in the wrong direction or just remaining stationary while appearing to ponder their next step. Doorways are especially problematic, regardless of whether you're leading the way or are trying to send your guys in ahead of you to soak up some enemy fire. When you're in front, it's not uncommon to open a door, step into a room, and encounter the guys that were right behind you already standing around waiting for you in there. Other times they prefer to enter through different doors while running backward, or perhaps crash through a window for an entrance that really gets them noticed. If you turn your back on them, though, they'll be warped instantly to your side, sometimes.      Initially you get to recruit only one of these laughable soldiers for your family, and you get to choose between a demolitions expert and a medic. The former can create shortcuts through walls and blow up buildings, but like most of the crew abilities, these can be used in only very specific locations. The latter is arguably the most useful guy you'll ever meet, because if you or any other crew member gets killed, he can bring you back to life with full health just by sticking a needle in you. Ultimately, you can recruit up to seven made men for your family, and as they prove their worth, you can spend money on attribute upgrades and better weapons for them and even promote them so that they can specialize in more than one field. It behooves you to take the maximum allowed three crew members with you on every mission that you accept and to every business that you make a move on, because location layouts are generally so contrived and architecturally improbable that, for example, the only way into a building with seemingly easily accessible doors might be to blow a hole in a wall or to have your engineer cut a hole in a fence. Annoyingly, there's no consistent rule set in the world of The Godfather II, so while some fences can be cut through in specific locations, other, identical-looking fences, are impenetrable. Doors are another example; some can be kicked down, some can be lock-picked, and others can't be opened even with dynamite. You can't even predict which waist-high walls you'll be able to vault over until you get close enough to try, which is incredibly frustrating if you're fleeing from the cops on foot.        Businesses that you control after successfully negotiating all of the aforementioned problems don't just earn you money; they can also unlock special perks for you if you claim every business within a crime ring. Controlling both of New York's prostitution rackets will get you brass knuckles, while three diamond smuggling operations in Florida will earn you and your crew bulletproof vests, for example. These crime-ring bonuses add some small degree of strategy to the proceedings when it comes to planning your next move, not least because rival families can benefit from the same bonuses that you can, but none of the bonuses significantly impact the difficulty of subsequent actions--regardless of who has them. Rivals will often attempt to reclaim or bomb businesses that you control, denying you your bonuses if they succeed, so it's important to hire guards to protect them. The guards aren't always up to the job if a rival family decides to send soldiers and capos along, but at the very least they'll buy you some time until you can send members of your own crew there via the ""Don's View"" map screen or go and join the fight yourself.        Rival families can be eliminated only when they've lost control of all businesses and have retreated to their fortress-like compounds. At this point, the compounds become unlocked so that you can get into them and fight your way to wherever it is that you need to place a bomb. In theory, you shouldn't attempt this kind of operation until you've weakened a family by assassinating a number of its made men, but in practice, the only real difference between those guys and the regular guards is that it takes more bullets to put them down. Interestingly, the only way to permanently kill a made man other than to bomb his family's compound is to do so in a way that sends a specific message to his family, and you can find out which message needs to be sent only by doing favors for people you meet on the street. Remember how Vito Corleone was unable to turn down any request from a friend on his daughter's wedding day in the first Godfather movie? Well, this is nothing like that. Rather, you approach complete strangers and tell them they look like they need help, at which point they tell you who or which building they want attacked. Do them the favor, and they'll tell you where one of your enemies can be found and that he can only be killed with a Molotov, with a shot between the eyes, with a fall from a great height, by being run over with a car, or something similar. Not only is soliciting murder advice from random pedestrians totally absurd, carrying out these contrived actions is more trouble than it's worth, so you'll probably end up just bombing the compound every time.       Once you take down all five families, you're about done with the single-player portion of The Godfather II. Multiplayer modes designed for up to 16 players include Team Deathmatch, Demolition Assault, FireStarter, and Safecracker. You play as one of the members of your crew from the single-player game, and as you earn honor points online, you can use them to upgrade your guys' weapon licenses so that they're able to use more-powerful guns both online and off. Your choice of crew member will likely be dictated by the game type that you're playing because, in case you hadn't guessed, those last three modes favor players with demolition, arson, and safecracker skills, respectively. Unfortunately, The Godfather II's multiplayer isn't much fun. Targeting enemies without the lock-on feature feels too imprecise on consoles, completing objectives on the non-deathmatch modes doesn't earn you as many points as just killing people, and most of the maps are too big for just 16 players.   One of the more interesting multiplayer features, regardless of the fact that it's functional rather than fun, is the option for one player on each team to play as the don. As the don, you don't play as a guy on the ground at all, but as a disembodied camera flying high above the map and able to relay information to teammates about enemy locations and the like both with voice chat and by dropping waypoint beacons. When your team captures strategic locations on the map, you can also reward them with bulletproof vests and other perks, which is great for them but as boring as it sounds for you. Worse still, you can only fly around freely at a fixed altitude, so although you have the option to jump between players and key locations with a couple of button presses, your movement still feels oddly restricted. It's possible to make money as the don by betting on the outcome of games, but money's unlikely to be an issue once you near the end of the single-player game, so it's hardly compelling.      Questionable design choices aside, the problem with almost every aspect of The Godfather II is simply that it feels unfinished. Dated visuals, voiced lines of dialogue that seemingly play at random and often inappropriate times, dead bodies falling through scenery, a car hovering in the air about half a mile off the Cuban coast, being able to snipe enemies through walls and doors that haven't popped into view yet, guards who fail to recognize you as a threat when you walk into a federal building and crack a safe, cars and pedestrians that appear and disappear long before they leave your range of vision, getting stuck in an animation somewhere between a regular walk and a crouch after vaulting through a window--these are just some of the problems we encountered in the 13 hours or so that it took to play from start to finish. Even looking past these anomalies, all you're going to find is repetitive, unsatisfying gameplay in an illogical, inconsistent world. The Godfather II should have been an offer impossible to refuse, but like Michael's brother Fredo, this one will break your heart.  "
1567,Trove,7.0,2," Yes, this is another voxel game. Even the most cursory glance at Trove's voxel-heavy landscapes and characters is enough to determine that it owes some heavy debts to Minecraft, and as with Minecraft, exploration and crafting lie at the heart of the experience. Yet these elements also allow Trove to differentiate itself from almost every other massively multiplayer game by making all zones randomly generated, and each can be accessed from level-appropriate portals in the hub world. Deserts give way to motherboardy landscapes straight out of Tron, tundra gives way to open seas where you can fish or steer a ship, and as with Minecraft, almost every bit of it can be harvested and used for crafting. Most of the time, that crafting occurs on player homes on player plots (called ""cornerstones"") or in a special zone for ""clubs"" (i.e., Trove's version of guilds), where groups of players can build their own world one voxel at a time. One downside is that plots for the single-player homes aren't particularly large; I was barely able to get a rudimentary re-creation of the Alamo up on mine. Other players have made better work with the limitations, though, usually by going up. My favorite cornerstone was a re-creation of Sauron's tower of Barad-dûr, which shot so far into the sky that I marveled as much at the player's ability not to fall while building it as at the design. Others seem to represent Mega Man levels, as they require a seemingly endless succession of timed leaps to reach the player's health potion refill station or other service boxes. The best thing about cornerstones is that you can move them around to each new randomly generated world you visit as needed, adding both convenience and a way to show off your skills (or patience). Trove is an apt name for the experience that developer Trion Worlds delivers. On the most basic level, it refers to the little troves of loot waiting at the end of the mini-dungeons that dot the landscape, yes, but it also calls attention to the sheer variety of displays. Collectible helmets and masks ranging from Viking beards and sombreros to baseball caps and kabuki masks seem to number in the hundreds or thousands, offering a wealth of cosmetic customization. Weapons share the same variety, with items like guns and swords running the gamut from fearsome to silly. The beauty of Trove is that many of these items are made by players themselves, making the looting experience far more rewarding than it would have been if Trion were responsible for it alone. Assuming you've bought another class either with cash or in-game currency, you can switch between classes in an instant. That variety affects other aspects as well. A common criticism of contemporary MMOGs is that they launch with too few classes or they don't deviate far enough from the old standbys of warrior, wizard, and rogue, but Trove suffers from neither of those problems. Its Steam launch contained no fewer than 11 classes, and since Trove doesn't really have a story, it's not hobbled with a need to stick with lore or even a half-hearted sense of consistency. It's the perfect recipe for a diverse cast. Take the Boomeranger, which pays homage to Link from The Legend of Zelda with its ability to switch between boomerang and sword. Consider the Dracolyte, which can transform into a dragon and burn the voxel landscape. Most of my time was spent with the Pirate Captain, a minion class that can toss out a massive cannon or a puppet that taunts enemies, all while his parrot companion bombards them with a cannon of his own. Most classes thus feel wonderfully different from each other, although that couldn't have been too hard to achieve, considering that each class only gets three abilities. They're designed well, and they generally allow each class to be a tank, healer, and damage dealer all rolled into one, but this limitation means that gameplay inevitably grows repetitive with time. Some, such as the Pirate Captain, handle this better than others. On my Candy Barbarian, however, the familiar dance of leaping and executing a whirlwind attack to regain health bored me before I'd even reached level 8. That's not really a problem, though; assuming you've bought another class either with cash or in-game currency, you can switch between classes in an instant (although, as in Final Fantasy XIV, you'll have to level it separately). A variety of enemies walk the open world if you'd like to try your skills on any ol' thing, but most of the action takes place in the many dungeons dotting the countryside. This, even more than crafting, is what Trove is all about. You fight and leap your way through a dungeon, kill the boss (which can be anything from a dragon to some formless blob), and take its loot. All of these dungeons are short, but some are impressive, especially those that require jumping puzzles before engaging a boss or those that require you to use your mining beam to dig your way to the lair. Admittedly, with some of the more powerful classes (such as the Candy Barbarian), these are almost a joke. Trove may be an MMOG, but virtually all of its content is soloable, and boss kills (and thus personal loot drops and XP) count if you just happened to be in the area of another player doing the killing. Finding a group is usually just a matter of seeing where other players are on the map are riding over to see what they're up to. Indeed, socialization is hardly Trove's strong suit. Half the time, I forgot that the chat window was even there, and while you can join up to five clubs, joining them is often just a case of waiting for somebody to announce open invites in chat. The saving grace? Trove has a wonderful community, and its generosity usually makes up for missing features. The best thing about cornerstones is that you can move them around to each new randomly generated world you visit as needed. All in all, this is generally enjoyable stuff, provided you can get in. Trove has been wildly popular on Steam ever since its first appearance on the platform back on July 9--so popular, in fact, that even now, queues often leave me waiting for 30 minutes to an hour before I can get in. I once managed to watch an entire episode of Louie before being able to get back to the business of busting blocks, and that was just last week. It's especially saddening since MMOG developer Trion should be no stranger to this kind of stuff--although similar problems affected the company's release of ArcheAge last year--but it's a testament to Trove's quality that the waits don't seem to affect its popularity. Without fail, every time the queue winds down, I land in a pile of other newly logged-in players, and we rush for the portals to the explore worlds with all the joy of children newly released on the playground. After many hours of play, that feeling still hasn't entirely faded, but I suspect I'll soon have to step away from Trove for a while to maintain it. Trove is all about the business of exploration, hoarding, and crafting, and in the absence of other MMOG standbys like story quests or PvP, the weight of the requisite repetition starts to nag just a bit past level 10. Trove does its best to fill these gaps with other options, such as leveling different classes, attempting to build a dungeon worthy of inclusion in the game, or simply collecting cosmetic items from boss kills, but for me, it doesn't deliver the kind of MMO addiction that sends me to the computer to sneak in more playtime after everyone else is asleep. That's the beauty of the free-to-play model, of course. Should I decide to step away for a few days, Trove and its troves are right there waiting for me, just as I left them. It doesn't hurt that Trion's latest MMOG has about as benign a free-to-play model as they get, as you can amass most of the premium coins needed to buy items like new classes or new mounts fairly easily. What's more, Trove allows players to spend real cash to buy in-game gold (along with some performance boosts), but that matters little since there's almost no competition involved. Is Trove the kind of MMOG that I'd like to spend a part of every day in? No. But it is an MMOG that I'd enjoy visiting every now and then, possibly several times a week. That's enough to make Trove a success, and its speedy updates and randomly generated worlds help make every visit feel different from the last. Now, if they'd just get those queues in line, I'm thinking about making the Alamo 40 stories high, and I don't have time to wait."
4284,Digimon World 4,4.0,0,"  After a three-year hiatus, Bandai has returned with a new installment in the constantly metamorphosing Digimon World series. Just as Digimon World 3 made the genre jump from monster-raising simulation to a fairly traditional Japanese role-playing game, Digimon World 4 tweaks the formula once again, turning it into a real-time action RPG. This may please whatever contingency there is of fans who still keep up with Bandai's answer to Pokémon, but for everyone else this is just a slapdash action RPG that seems more intent on punishing players with clumsy, tedious gameplay than actually engaging, or maybe even entertaining, them.        Upon choosing one of four low-level Digimon, you venture into the Digimon World as a member of the Digital Security Guard, and you are sent off to investigate the appearance of a mysterious new server and the disappearance of a team of Digimon explorers. The story is a pretty thin excuse to dump you into environments brimming with enemies eager to pummel you into an incoherent pile of ones and zeroes.      Rather than fighting by proxy as you did in Digimon World 3, you are given direct, real-time control over a single Digimon here. Your Digimon can run, jump, block, and attack, though for the most part you'll likely just be impatiently tapping on the X button to jab away at your enemies. The controls are pretty basic and intuitive, but for a game that, at least theoretically, is aimed at younger players, Digimon World 4 is extremely punishing right from the start. The game gets easier as you pick up new weapons and armor and your Digimon gains levels and periodically ""digivolves"" into a more powerful form. At the beginning, though, virtually each and every enemy you face is able to both deal and take much more punishment than you can, and the game isn't shy about throwing a good half-dozen enemies at you at once. Combine this with a block system with such specific timing that you almost need to be psychic, and only the truly dedicated Digimon fans will be willing to soldier on. The game features four-player cooperative support, though why you would want to subject three people you might call friends to this experience is a bit of a mystery.        And it's not like the game offers up a stunning audiovisual feast to make up for the alternately boring and sadistic gameplay. First off, there's the camera. Since there's no kind of map for you to rely on, what you see is the only point of reference you have for where you are and where you need to go, and even when the camera is zoomed out to the maximum, it's nearly impossible to get your bearings. Additionally, the camera moves entirely on its own, and the movement usually seems arbitrary and often obscures what you actually want to see. The visuals are pretty colorful, with the whole ""base"" area using a Tron-inspired combination of glowing lights and weird polygonal grids. The dungeons you'll travel to still retain a little bit of this neon flair, though they tend to look more like dungeons and suffer from bland, blurry textures. Regardless of style, though, everything in the game looks simple and chunky, and at points it barely qualifies as a current-generation game. The game's sound design isn't so much bad as it is repetitive and unremarkable. Everyone makes roughly the same muddy, indistinct noises when poked, and there's not really much music to speak of.     Digimon World 4 is a dull and largely forgettable experience, which, considering the quality of the previous three Digimon World games, really shouldn't be too big of a surprise to anyone. Those who are blissfully unaware of the world of Digimon likely wouldn't have played Digimon World 4 in the first place, even by accident. However, fans who are thinking about picking this up might want to consider why the creators of Digimon would punish their fans with a game as categorically unenjoyable as this.  "
3207,Fight Night Champion,8.0,2,"Fight Night Round 4. Wherever you go you'll find that Fight Night Champion improves upon its already-great predecessor in mostly minor but meaningful ways.        Upon entering the ring for the first time, you could be forgiven for thinking that Fight Night Champion is a mindless slugfest. That's not only because it's easy to throw an unrealistically high number of punches simply by flicking the right analog stick (or pressing the face buttons, if you prefer), but also because you might not yet realize the importance of defending, countering, and conserving your stamina. You might enjoy some success spamming punches on the easiest of the four difficulty levels or against inexperienced opponents online, but you need to master both the offensive and defensive controls to make it through Champion mode or to make a name for yourself elsewhere. Fortunately there's nothing complicated about the controls, and even if you've been reluctant to throw your punches using the right analog stick in previous games you might want to give it a try this year. Previous Fight Night games have required you to rotate the stick with some precision to throw different types of punches, but here those same straights, overhands, hooks, and uppercuts are simply mapped to different directions, so you're far less likely to throw the wrong punch. It's an intuitive system, and when used in conjunction with shoulder button modifiers for body punches and more powerful shots, it affords you easy access to a formidable repertoire.     The defensive controls used for blocking, leaning, and clinching are similarly uncomplicated, though it's only through practice that you can get a feel for the timing that's needed to open your opponent up for powerful counterpunching opportunities. You might have no intention of playing Fight Night Champion as a counterpuncher, but after being on the receiving end of a few counters (AI opponents are quick to punish you if you leave yourself exposed), you'll be compelled to add them to your own arsenal. You need to use every move at your disposal to succeed in Fight Night Champion, and that's especially true in Champion mode, where story events often force you to adapt your fighting style to different rules or situations. For example, early on your fights in prison don't end until only one of you is left standing, while the flashback fights at the amateur world championships are points-based. And once you turn pro, all manner of obstacles are thrown your way to keep the action from becoming repetitive. In one fight you hurt yourself anytime you use a broken hand, and in the next you have to knock out your opponent with the same hand to prove to everyone that it's healed, for example. Other memorable fights include one in which a crooked referee has been paid off to rule all of your body shots as low blows, and another that you spend protecting a cut near your eye.       Rocky-esque cliches, it's still entertaining for as long as it takes you to reach the requisite final fight against a dangerous rival. How long that takes can vary a great deal depending on how quickly you're able to win fights, but it should be at least five or six hours before you step into the ring as Andre Bishop for the last time if you're playing at an appropriate difficulty level. Most of the storytelling is done via well-voiced dialogue in great-looking cutscenes, with extra flavor during fights coming courtesy of ESPN's ringside announcers Joe Tessitore and Teddy Atlas as well as your trainer. The former are occasionally amusing and mostly accurate with their observations, and they even go so far as to comment on your performances in previous fights. The latter, whom you sadly don't always get to hear from between rounds, often has sound advice for you and doesn't pull any punches when it comes to letting you know how he feels the fight is progressing. Impressively, the announcers and trainer do their jobs just as well outside of the scripted Champion mode, though in Legacy mode the former are accurate only a little more often than a stopped clock when it comes to detailing the result of your previous fight.     If you played Fight Night Round 4's Legacy mode, then you already have a good idea of what to expect from it in Fight Night Champion. You schedule fight after fight for your created boxer, and juggle training, rest periods, and obligations to sponsors and the like between fights. Some improvements have been made, but the career structure is unchanged, and training minigames--though less frustrating than their counterparts in Round 4--are still a necessary evil. Tedious training minigames aside, there's a lot of fun to be had creating a custom boxer (you can use one of more than 70 licensed and Champion mode boxers if you prefer) and then developing him into a champion, a Hall of Famer, or even the greatest of all time. Creation tools are every bit as powerful as those in other EA Sports games and afford you the freedom to customize your boxer's appearance using photos taken with your console's camera, digital photos uploaded to the EA Sports website, as well as dozens of different sliders. It's still not easy to put a realistic likeness of yourself into the game, but with a little patience you can certainly come up with a boxer that's recognizable as you--at least from the neck up. And once you're done perfecting your pretty boy, you have an opportunity to tailor his skill set so that the face you just spent so much time getting right doesn't become a showpiece for Fight Night Champion's excellent damage and blood effects. (Blood even sprays out of cuts and shows up on the fighters, on their shorts, and on the mat.)        It's probably a good idea to play at least a handful of fights before creating a boxer for Legacy mode because that way you'll have some idea of your preferred style. Choosing the correct style from the seven available for your boxer during the creation process doesn't lock you into fighting that way for your entire career, but it has an impact both on your starting skills and on how many experience points it costs to upgrade different skills as you progress. For example, if you make an ""inside fighter,"" you already have some good hooks and uppercuts at your disposal as your career gets under way, but your straights aren't nearly as powerful and cost a lot to upgrade. Create a ""counterpuncher"" on the other hand, and you start with a good selection of head shots in your arsenal as well as good blocking, head movement, chin, and heart attributes, but your shots to the body are weak. It's a great system that encourages you to choose a fighting style and stick with it but also gives you the freedom to experiment with different approaches if opponents are making it difficult for you to stick to your game plan.      The experience points used to level up your boxer's skills are earned not only in the various training minigames that you take part in between fights, but also by winning fights and fulfilling challenge criteria while doing so. Fight challenges are an excellent addition to Legacy mode; they award you bonus experience points for taking little damage during fights, scoring a knockdown before a specific round, and even for causing a cut on your opponent. It's not always possible for you to actively pursue these bonuses because just making sure that you win has to take priority, but there's no better feeling in Legacy mode than knocking out an opponent and then realizing that you completed all of the fight challenges before doing so. That way you have even more experience points to spend on skills, which itself is pretty interesting in this year's game.        For the most part, the skills that you level up in Fight Night Champion are specific punches (jab head, right hook head, left uppercut body), and when you spend points on them you can see that you're improving their speed, power, and/or accuracy. What makes the boxer growth screen so compelling is that as you level up your skills and they move closer to the level cap of 20, you hit milestones that unlock significant bonuses and even new abilities for your fighter. For example, at level six many punches gain a chance to stun opponents for a short time, and at level 15 they can score flash knockdowns. If you manage to get one of your punches to level 20--which isn't difficult if you forgo spending your experience in other areas--it becomes possible for you to score a one-punch knockout. It all sounds very artificial, but it doesn't feel that way at all when you climb into the ring because you can rarely get away with throwing the same punch that you've leveled up over and over again, and even if you do, there's no guarantee that you're going to score any kind of stun or knockdown. The action is believable for the most part, and what's most impressive about the fights is that even without the scripted events that add drama in Champion mode, you're never quite sure how they're going to play out.     Even if you always carefully select your next Legacy mode opponent by studying the skill ratings, recent fight histories, and physical attributes of all the guys who are available to fight you, they can still surprise you in the ring. In Fight Night Champion, as in real life, it can take only one punch to turn a fight around, so you can never get too comfortable, and you should never give up. Every fight has the potential to turn into a memorable one, so even if you spend nine rounds getting beaten up pretty badly, there's no reason you can't knock your opponent out in the 10th to claim the win. Similarly, if you score a lucky punch against a superior opponent and manage to cut him early in the fight or maybe cause so much swelling that his eye closes, there's a decent chance that--if you keep targeting the damaged area--the referee will stop the fight and award a technical knockout in your favor.        Referees rarely have much to do in Fight Night Champion, unless you resort to using the head-butts and low blows that are mapped onto the D pad. Regardless, referees now appear in the ring alongside fighters and, for the most part, appear to move around realistically, staying out of the fighters' way and trying to get a good view of what's going on. What's unfortunate is that, at least on the default camera setting, referees have a terrible habit of positioning themselves between the camera and the action, thus obscuring your view. Unhelpful refs aside, the camera does a great job of framing the action and of showing off the impressively detailed fighter models when they sit down in their respective corners. Without exception, the 50-plus licensed boxers are instantly recognizable and look superb, and while created boxers (which can again be shared with other players online) rarely look quite as good, they certainly don't look out of place alongside the likes of Mike Tyson, Lennox Lewis, Joe Calzaghe, Jake LaMotta, Marvin Hagler, Ricky Hatton, and Manny Pacquiao, to name but a few. There are, of course, plenty of big names missing from the roster, but players are already creating and sharing likenesses of their favorite fighters complete with customized fighting styles, so even though they're not on the official roster, it's already possible to re-create famous matchups between British middleweights Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank, for example. You can even pit Rocky IV's Ivan Drago against Marilyn Manson if you really want to.     Once added to your roster, custom fighters appear alongside both licensed fighters and characters from Champion mode for use in one-off fights locally and online. Fight Night Champion's online offering is similar to that in last year's Round 4. Regular ranked or unranked fights can be found either through an automatic matching system that searches for players of comparable experience, or in lobbies that sort players by skill level and geography. Online gyms serve much the same purpose that clans and guilds do in non-sports games and afford you an opportunity to fight with customized rule sets and gameplay settings while using one of your created fighters. If you're more interested in individual leaderboards than in gym rivalries, you're sure to enjoy the Online World Championship mode. Here, you can compete for belts and titles in light-, middle-, and heavyweight classes secure in the knowledge that, because fighters are all given comparable stats, it's your skill that determines the result rather than the fighters' stats and skills. Should you manage to claim a title, know that there will be no shortage of challenges coming your way because a message pops up on the screen of every other player to let them know when you come online.        Online fights are smooth for the most part, but lag can be an issue on occasion. The lag is never so bad that it's seriously detrimental to the gameplay, but it's unfortunate that lag is present at all because, upon entering a laggy ranked fight, you have only three choices: continue playing, add a loss to your record by not getting up the first time you're knocked down (no thanks), or quit prematurely and gain a ""did not finish"" (DNF) rating. A DNF might cause other players to avoid you and that makes it harder for you to search for opponents, because you can't search for fights with players who have DNF ratings lower than yours.     Even if online competition doesn't interest you, Fight Night Champion is a great game that has a lot to offer. The story-driven Champion mode is an entertaining addition to the series, and once you get into the Legacy mode you might find that it's hard to put down your controller even after you've spent dozens of hours using the same fighter. And beyond those single-player modes there's a great deal of fun to be had with friends, re-creating memorable matchups and pitting great boxers from different eras against each other in fights that would no doubt have been fascinating in real life. The latest Fight Night might never be remembered as the greatest boxing game of all time, but for right now it's definitely the champion.   "
2312,Transformers: War for Cybertron,6.0,1,"      The 10-level campaign stretches for more than 15 hours, but because the majority of the game entails walking through similar-looking corridors gunning down waves of mindless robots, it seems to drag on far longer than that. The core mechanics are certainly well done--jumping around the environment is responsive, and it's easy enough to swing your sights onto a fast-approaching foe--but there are too many small issues that continually get in the way of the action. For instance, the cramped level design and quantity of enemy fire forces you to take cover often, making the game play like a cover-based shooter. However, you cannot actually snap behind objects, which means it's easy to have a body part exposed when you thought you were safely hidden. More troubling is the ammunition, or lack thereof. Every gun you fire in your humanoid or vehicle form (except for jets) requires ammo, but your bullets are depleted far too quickly, forcing you to spend time scouring the environment for replenishment rather than busting up bots. This is compounded by an incredibly slow reload process that continually interrupts the flow of combat. Every time you get in a groove, you have to spend precious seconds either reloading or searching for more bullets, continually pulling you away from any of the fun you could be having.                    "
775,Big Bash Boom,5.0,1,"Big Bash cricket is all about smashing the heck out of every ball and scoring as many runs as possible, and Big Bash Boom does a superb job of recreating the buzzing atmosphere you'll find at the ground during a BBL match, complete with wild crowds, fireworks displays, and unintentionally terrifying-looking mascots. You can pick any of the eight licensed teams from either the BBL or Women's BBL, taking them to glory in a casual match, full tournament, or online head-to-head.When jumping straight into a casual match, you can customize match options, team lineups, and ball type, which includes a few fun varieties--pie, anyone? You're led out onto the pitch and greeted by real-world commentator Pete Lazer, though his occasionally charming reads come off as a series of one-liners instead of actual commentary, and they begin to grate after some repeats.Out on the field is where Big Bash Boom shows off its main differences to past cricket games, including Ashes Cricket, which was by the same developer as Big Bash Boom. The action has been streamlined to cut out a lot of the dead air time that you tend to get at a cricket match, which gives the game its arcade feel. You're never asked to pick bowlers or select lineups. You can if you wish, but the game will otherwise make these calls to ensure a faster flow. The players all have NBA Jam-style big heads, which shows off the player likenesses in a way that's easy to appreciate. Faces are detailed, if a little robotic and expressionless, but the overall look works in context, especially combined with the great use of special effects to mark big shots.Batting and bowling feel more pick-up-and-play than in any other cricket game; however, the lack of a meaningful tutorial means things that should be obvious knowledge, like what the changing cursor colour on the pitch means, remain a mystery until you just happen to work it out through the natural course of playing. But that aside, it's simple enough to get into a match and start slogging balls left and right, with timing and shot selection all coming into play. Time it perfectly, and you'll probably make it sail over the ropes, but get it wrong and you might pop the ball up for an easy catch or swing and miss entirely. Bowling is a touch more complicated, involving selecting a bowl type to start the run in and then keeping the cursor on the pitch in place while timing your release. It often feels like you're up against it as a bowler; there's little you can do to avoid being belted around the park apart from bowling the occasional short ball, and you're limited to performing only one of those per over. Getting belted around every ball takes some getting used to, but thankfully if you'd rather spare yourself the embarrassment, you can always simulate the innings.The inclusion of power-ups for batters and bowlers help pump up the excitement of a match, and you can activate these after filling a special meter by hitting runs and boundaries as a batter, or dot balls and wickets as a bowler. Each exhibits some excellent-looking animations and special effects, and you'll get some extra power for the next few balls. Bowlers can bowl twice as fast, fielders are able to run at double their speed, and batters can force slower throws from the outfield or hit twice as hard, sending loose balls into the stratosphere. It's immensely satisfying.Everything you do in a match will earn you coins that you can put towards buying new in-match celebrations, which you're prompted to perform after hitting a big six or taking a wicket. While it's somewhat satisfying to rub it in your opponent's face, the lack of gameplay benefits makes showboating feel a little arbitrary. You can also purchase cosmetic customizations like new hats and helmets, but that's as far as personalization goes; disappointingly, there's no player or team editor.Beyond the excellent special moves and vibrant aesthetic, the rest of the game struggles to hide its seams, most notably when it comes to animations. Fielders will move about awkwardly when chasing the ball before settling and sending in the return throw, while batters often warp into place before setting off for a run. There are also some more obtrusive bugs that, when they hit, can change the outcome of a match. A few times I was called out for a catch on one side of the field when the camera made it look like the ball had gone in the opposite direction. I've also had catches made in the outfield seem as though they don't count, with my player harmlessly throwing the ball back to the keeper as though nothing happened--something that can be immensely frustrating.Big Bash Boom's potential is clear. Despite its singular focus making it feel a little barebones when compared to other cricket titles, the shift towards arcade gameplay feels perfectly suited to the relatively flamboyant presentation of the BBL. But it's washed with bugs that affect the core of the experience, and those technical issues make it difficult to warm up to."
3946,Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,5.0,1," Atari hasn't had much luck up to this point with its license for Terminator 3, the last installment in the Terminator film franchise, starring longtime action hero and current California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox was a substandard first-person shooter, riddled with bugs and distinctly low on production value. On the PC, Terminator 3: War of the Machines was a team-based online shooter that had absolutely no dedicated server support, a practically nonexistent offline single-player mode, and even more bugs than its console-based brethren. The last of Atari's 2003 lineup for the T3 franchise is Rise of the Machines for the Game Boy Advance. The GBA version of Rise of the Machines is a third-person shooter, played with an isometric camera view. Of all the T3 games released this year, Rise of the Machines for the GBA is easily the best one; but once you get beyond comparisons to the rest of the motley Terminator 3 bunch, the game doesn't hold up on its own merits.      In Rise of the Machines, you once again take on the role of Arnold Schwarzenegger's model 101 T-800 series Terminator. Your basic controls as the Terminator give you two distinct weapon abilities--one for shooting your current weapon and the other for throwing and planting explosive devices and for punching when you have no explosives equipped. Using the left trigger button, you can also make the Terminator walk, run, or strafe, and the select button puts him into a scan mode that turns the screen red and helps you detect otherwise hidden people and objects.    There's a nice variety of weapons in the game, each with multiple degrees of firepower. However, some of them feel a little too overpowered for the level of challenge the game generally puts forth. This is especially notable with the punching function, which does more damage than more than half your guns and explosives. The only real difficulty with shooting comes from the game's isometric camera view, which can make it a bit difficult to line up your target properly. This isn't much of a factor when you have a gun with a wider firing range, but when you're using weaker guns, it can be rather frustrating.   The game loosely follows the same type of story arc that the console versions did. You start off in the movie's bleak, postapocalyptic future, where the human resistance sends you back in time to help protect John Connor, the leader of the resistance, from an evil female terminator who is programmed to kill him before he can lead the human uprising against the machines. The game's 12 missions are split up half and half between the future and the present, though ultimately, the difference in time period is really the only difference you'll notice between any of them.    Though Rise of the Machines gives you some varying types of mission objectives, they all essentially revolve around running through a level, killing everything in sight, and then maybe hitting a switch or protecting someone briefly while he or she hacks a computer. Some objectives literally take no longer than 20 seconds, and others can go on for several minutes. Most levels are also fairly easy, mainly because none of the game's enemies are particularly tough. It takes only a couple of shots to bring down nearly every regular enemy in the game. Bosses take more hits to destroy, but their attack patterns are usually quite easy to decipher, so they're also fairly simple to take out. Additionally, the game loads you up with weapon and energy power-ups to an almost gluttonous degree, leaving you with little worry about ever dying. The single-player story mode ends up being only a couple of hours long.   Terminator 3 also has a multiplayer mode, with two different types of games. Using the GBA link cable, you can play a two-player co-op game, where you and a friend play together through a single level, wasting as many enemies as you can. There is also a capture-the-flag mode for up to four players, where you have to track down a flag that's hidden in a level and bring it back to your designated base point. The winner is the one with the most captures. While both of these modes are a nice idea conceptually, their execution fails altogether. The capture-the-flag mode can be rather confusing, since you'll constantly have to travel between sections in the level using teleport points, which don't actually tell you where you'll end up, and it's pretty easy to end up wandering around with the flag for a minute or so, trying to figure out where your base is, only to get popped at the last second by an opponent. The co-op mode is just flat-out boring. It's just the same thing over and over again: Enemies spawn, you shoot them all until they stop spawning, and then you move to the next room, which looks exactly like the first. Again, the multiplayer component is a nice idea, but the hasty and subpar execution of the mode essentially renders it useless.      Terminator 3's graphics are also below average. The game does a few nice things here and there, with some neat-looking explosions and occasionally cool enemy designs. For the most part, though, everything else just looks pretty nasty and underdeveloped. The game's levels are all primarily linear in design, though there are lots of wide, barren spaces where you'll generally find yourself just wandering around with little, if anything, going on in the background. The areas that do have real backgrounds don't look all that great, and most of them repeat a lot of the same elements over and over. The Terminator himself doesn't look good at all, and if it weren't for the token sunglasses on his face, you'd barely even know it was supposed to be Arnold. Animations are limited to only the most basic movement functions, giving everything a very stiff feel. The game's audio is a little better than everything else in the game, though only marginally. At no point does the infamous Terminator theme song appear in the game, but the in-game tracks that are included are pretty good and set the proper atmosphere. Each gun has its own distinct sound effect, and the various ""robot"" noises enemy Terminators make are also adequate for what the game is trying to get across.    Though the GBA version of Rise of the Machines does fare better than any other Terminator 3 game to date, it still suffers from a lot of the same problems the other T3 games did, including the feel that the game was simply rushed through production as fast as possible to cash in on the license at the right time. There are many other shooters available for the Game Boy Advance that are better and less thrown-together than Terminator 3, and as such, it really isn't worth your time.   "
2704,Silent Hill: Downpour,8.0,2,"     Silent Hill: Homecoming, though it is not as exaggerated. Often in combat, you face down a group of enemies in an open area. Large environments afford Murphy access to more weapons, while the monsters gain the advantage of flanking.       In Downpour, Murphy can only carry one melee weapon at a time, so he is constantly cycling through them. Fire axes, chairs, lamps, and more are littered about, but they eventually break apart. This weapon degradation emphasizes how desperate combat encounters are for him. Murphy may start a fight with a garden rake but end with a puny stick. Unarmed attacks are an option, but they do almost no damage and you can't block while unarmed. If you're lucky enough to find a firearm, Murphy can pocket it as a secondary weapon. Guns are extremely powerful, but ammo is scarce.     Additional design choices add complexity to the combat, but in doing so, they call more of your attention to the faults. In early Silent Hill games, combat was deemphasized through simplistic controls and stellar sound design. With Downpour, there are more ways Murphy can attack--or be attacked--in a fight. You spend more time thinking about combat, and the weaknesses therein become more pronounced. Striking an enemy still feels stiff, and against most enemies, the fights fall into predictable rhythms. When monsters attack in groups, one usually hangs back and temporarily disables Murphy with a sound-based attack. It's a novel tactic, but it's recycled throughout nearly the entire game.     Of course, combat isn't all you do in Downpour. The town of Silent Hill has a touch of open-worldness and is filled with puzzles and side quests to discover. The side quests are well tailored to the game's setting and imply there was once life in this desolate town. They include investigating a domestic murder, searching for a missing child, and venturing inside a collection of historic films. These optional quests are a smart addition and encourage, as well as reward, exploration.       In the other world, you do a lot of running. Early on, you are introduced to a glowing ball of energy that wants to chase Murphy down and change him from a solid form into a liquid. Murphy's escape takes him through a maze of hallways lined with obstacles that can be knocked over to slow down the being's advance. Thankfully, one wrong turn doesn't mean death. Incorrect routes loop back to the main path, though you will take some damage from the formless horror. These sections help break up the game's slow pace with high-speed action that's appropriate for the setting.       The Silent Hill series is famous for its music and sound design. In previous Silent Hill games, the music could make the most mundane encounters intimidating. It was an oppressive mixture of industrial noise, radio static, and monster cries. In contrast, Downpour downplays its encounters to the point where most fights are in near silence. Music is largely absent, and while there are still radio and monster effects much of their impact is gone. Sometimes this subtle approach is used to great effect, but too often it makes combat feel commonplace.     Hansel and Gretel. Once all of the items are recovered, there is a simple puzzle that explains how these items work together. Correctly solving the puzzle involves dimming the lights, playing the music, and producing the correct sound effects for the performance. And when you look up from your duties, it's revealed that you've been transported into the scene itself.     Thunder and lightning crash overhead, muffling the eerie hum of an old gramophone. The sounds of children screaming can be heard from the now very-real wood cabin, separated from you by a dark forest. Naturally, it's difficult to see through the rain until a flash of lightning reveals the hulking form of an enemy. There's no fanfare or  blaring music; it's just standing there, off in the distance, waiting. You're initially surprised, and then you feel the looming dread of the coming fight. The sequence progresses beyond that, but taken as a whole, it combines traditional Silent Hill puzzles with a bit of combat within a great set piece. It successfully channels the surprise and anxiety that has made this series great.     Unfortunately, almost all of Downpour's accomplishments are marred by some persistent frame rate and stuttering issues. They occur throughout nearly the entire game but are most noticeable in the larger environments, such as the town itself. At times, they are excusable, such as when the game is loading a new environment or autosaving. But when simply looking from side to side causes small hiccups and screen tearing, they become real issues. This happens much less often in smaller, interior spaces, but it is something you have to endure throughout.       Silent Hill: Downpour makes some questionable tweaks to the established formula, but those decisions distinguish it from the rest of the series. You may not agree with all of Vatra's choices, but they succeed in making an old town feel new again. And when it's the eighth installment in the series, that is quite an accomplishment.   "
3776,Need for Speed: Undercover,5.0,1," The Departed. Donnie Brasco. Reservoir Dogs. There are many great undercover adventures. Do not count Need for Speed Undercover for the Nintendo DS among their number. With shoddy graphics, bland environments, and dubious control, Need for Speed Undercover is a barely passable racing game. And on the scale of undercover adventures, it's trumped by the likes of Kindergarten Cop and White Chicks.        Normally it's not fair to compare a video game--and a DS game at that--to a film, but the latest Need for Speed title aimed to be nothing less than a cinematic tour de force, promising an ""action-packed story of pursuit and betrayal"" right there on the box. While EA did enlist some Hollywood names in Maggie Q and Christina Milian, it squandered their talent by only including still photos and text for each character, rather than the cheesy full-motion videos the franchise is known for. And boy, is the writing bad. Out of the blue, a woman named Rose calls and says, ""Hey, hey, Pretty Boy! We noticed you! 'Cause your moves are hot! Let's race out on the highway! Then maybe you can be my boyfriend!"" Racing ensues. Don't count on any additional exposition. You're forced to pop in the console version of Undercover in order to fully understand the plot, which apparently involves a hot car and some sort of package. Then again, if you're playing a Need for Speed game you didn't come for the story. You came to race. That, too, is uninspired.     Events are broken down into several basic categories. In Hot Car, you must take a stolen ride to the safe house, avoiding police entanglements. In Cost to State, you knock over stop signs and phone booths to cause destruction to the city and its budget. In Highway Battle, you take to the interstate and attempt to simply overtake your opponent, dodging the few cars on the road that love changing lanes for no apparent reason. In Scramble, you ditch your undercover guise, grab a Porsche police cruiser, and track down baddies. And in All Points, you simply track down and arrest one of the ""boss"" characters. There are also standard sprint and circuit races.         The selection of events in itself isn't bad, but the implementation is. In All Points, these intense boss fights may last only a few seconds, thanks to the speedbreaker slow-motion mechanic. Simply engage the speedbreaker, ram your enemy head-on, and wait for a handcuff meter to slowly fill. The collision physics are laughable, and you can continually ram an opponent, inexplicably bouncing him backward, and then make the arrest. In Cost to State, it's quickly clear that knocking over road cones for $50 a pop isn't going to net you the $15,000 needed to complete the mission. Instead, you learn to actively engage and ram the police, the one thing that you are supposed to avoid. Then you engage speedbreaker, ram the cop until his car is totaled (you don't take any damage), net a $2,500 damage bonus, and seek out the next cop. Finally, the computer opponents in the standard street racing modes will occasionally refuse to be beaten. But with these few exceptions, Undercover is entirely too easy. You can usually take a sharp turn at full speed, bounce off the wall, and continue on your way without losing much speed, if any.     That wouldn't be so much of an issue if the Tri City Bay Area wasn't so generic a racing venue. The morning commute is a breeze because there is absolutely no traffic. The backdrops are a drab collection of lifeless buildings, construction cranes, and an occasional bridge--you might as well be in Communist Russia. During races, the touch screen is used as a map only, and tapping it will zoom you in and out, much like in Mario Kart DS. Another feature shared with Nintendo's racer is that you can apply the handbrake to drift around corners, though the control is very loose and you're more likely to end up in the wall than on the track. In the event that a wall does slow you down, a quick press of the nitrous button will have you back in the lead in no time. Undercover does a good job of conveying  a sense of high speed when you unlock the more high performance vehicles, but it moves almost too fast. You're forced to constantly glance at map and then anticipate sharp turns as you approach them. By the time you actually see the turn on your screen, there's no time to react because of the miniscule draw distance. The speedbreaker helps here as it not only slows down time but dramatically improves your turning ability. And thanks to the aforementioned physics and collision system, you'll likely bounce off the wall anyway. Still, it would be more fun if you relied on your reflexes and vision rather than a top-down map in order to win races.        Car junkies will get a kick out of the garage, at least. After beating every career race, we managed to unlock a total of 19 cars, including the Ford Mustang Shelby GT500, Dodge Viper SRT10, Nissan GT-R, Porsche Carrera GT, and Lamborghini Murcielago LP640 (13mpg on the highway!). You can customize your look by purchasing a few body kits, rims, spoilers, and decals, and you can even design your own decal if you can survive the headache-inducing editor tool. There are also three levels of performance upgrades for your engine, nitrous, steering, brakes, and tires, though they do not include real-life licensed parts as in past NFS games. You do get a great feeling of ownership over a high-performance, customized ride because the upgrades are so tangible. A top engine upgrade will likely add 50mph to your top speed.      Both single-card and multicard multiplayer are supported, though single-card supports only two tracks and doesn't allow you to select a car. In terms of a racer, it's hard to recommend Undercover over notable DS games such as GRID or even Mario Kart DS. And as an undercover adventure? You'd do better to pass on this and rent Point Break or, heaven forbid, Undercover Brother.  "
3130,IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover,4.0,0,"  When a once-popular genre goes underrepresented for so long, it's tempting to give any new entry the benefit of the doubt. That's especially true when that new product comes from a developer known for its dedication to the subject matter. IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover is one such game, and Maddox Games is one such developer. What to make, then, of this unfinished fiasco, especially when its target audience has so few modern options? Like previous IL-2 installments, this World War II combat flight simulator will benefit from a passionate community and the included modification tools. But that's no excuse for the clearly broken state it was released in. The technical issues are a real shame, for underneath them is a solid and complex simulation that deserved a worthy package to showcase it. In time, Cliffs of Dover might soar. But for now, all but the most patient simmers should leave this damaged aircraft in the hangar for further maintenance.       Wings of Prey was not a proper simulation, but it set a high bar for flight game graphics using the IL-2 Sturmovik graphics engine, ironically enough. Cliffs of Dover is nowhere near that level of beauty, which makes the chugging even harder to stomach. It's easy to admire how shadows roam across the cockpit if you manage to run the game at higher settings and the way bullets shatter your windshield and leave holes in your wings. (This series' damage modeling has always been terrific.) But it all seems so meaningless when you fly above a relatively bland-looking London or a garish green-yellow countryside, only for the game to turn into a slide show.        That aforementioned damage model isn't just cosmetic: enemy bullets can puncture vital mechanisms (or if you have bombs at the ready, do something more immediately dramatic), though they are hardly the only factor in how your aircraft handles. Make no mistake: this is the real deal. If you are a dedicated simmer, you will appreciate the attention to detail in the way airplanes feel in the air and react to your actions. Crank up the realism options, and just getting off the ground is as daunting and rewarding as you might expect. A full takeoff procedure is emulated here on these settings, so you need to consider fuel mixture, open radiators, turn on magnetos, adjust prop pitch, and so on. Once you're in the air, vibration might indicate bad pitch, and failure to manage your systems can result in leaks and blown gaskets. (Having your windshield splattered with black goo is always a terrifying sign.) Sim fans will adore this kind of detail, though even they will note some obvious bugs and flaws. For example, you can pull up a menu for communicating to your wingmen, but the options don't actually work. Thus, you may come in for a successful landing, and then have your wingmen crash into you.      If you are new to flight sims, Cliffs of Dover lets you tailor your experience, though you have to jump through a lot of hoops regardless. The useless tutorial missions gloss over too much basic information to make them helpful for new pilots, so neophytes will need to study the manual and adjust controls in the in-game menus before feeling comfortable in the sky. (You absolutely need a joystick to get the most out of this game.) Fortunately for those folks, you can tweak realism settings in any number of ways, so if you are frightened by the prospects of full takeoff and landing procedures, you can avoid those steps altogether. Or better yet, choose the option that lets you start your engine(s) with a single keystroke. You might also engage the autopilot on long stretches and crank up the game speed, turn on the eyesore icons that identify friendlies and enemies, and even turn off stalls and spins. You couldn't call IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover friendly, exactly, but after the initial curve, there are plenty of ways to tailor the experience to your skill level.       Regardless of your skill, Cliffs of Dover, like most such games, can be tense and exciting. Dogfights and bombing runs aren't a thrill a minute, but they capture the sensation that anything can happen--and sometimes does. Roaring toward an enemy fighter in your Spitfire and filling it with holes is always rewarding. Firing your cannons causes your Messerschmitt to shake ominously, and watching your target spiral toward the sea is always a treat. Success takes patience; an overly steep climb could cause a stall, and banking too hard could send you into a spin or dive. It's a challenge to recover control in such cases, but proper use of the rudder can pull you out of a sticky situation, making such recoveries a relief. Dogfights are just as much about knowing your aircraft as they are about shooting down your foes--and that's what makes downing the pilot you're dogging so enjoyable. Triumphing is sweet, because you had to work hard for it: you aren't just shooting down one plane after another like some kind of otherworldly hero. Unfortunately, the statistics screen is busted, so don't look there if you want to pat yourself on the back for your remarkable skills.        Cliffs of Dover thus creates an atmosphere of wartime dread, though the sound design has a tendency to undermine the authenticity. The smooth growl of the Messerchmitt sounds fine, but other aspects of the audio sound clearly synthesized, and some noises sound as if they were sampled from lawnmowers rather than enormous airplane engines. Cannons sound more like bongo drums than they do actual cannons, and some glitches are overly obvious (the scraping noise that continues to play after a crash landing, for example). In any case, the disappointing sound doesn't fully break your immersion, and Cliffs of Dover, when it's running properly, gives you a great sense of being in an actual cockpit. The tension levels increase further when you take the game online, though this is an arena best left to experienced pilots--and those who can get past the frame rate problems and other issues that interfere with multiplayer competition. The game reportedly supports dozens upon dozens of players participating in persistent battles that could rage for hours, days, and even weeks, though you won't find such an experience in its current state. Should you find a multiplayer server, it's intimidating and rewarding to fight online, provided the visual stutters don't greatly hamper the experience. But that requires getting past the unintuitive interface, the slow server browser, the lack of dedicated server documentation, and plenty more.      Cliffs of Dover contains two campaigns, the first of which tells the tale of a Royal Air Force pilot struggling not just with his aircraft, but also with his fellow pilots. All storytelling is delivered between missions in a scrolling text window. The briefings lack proper punctuation and feature plenty of grammar errors, but they're descriptive enough to make you want to see where the story might lead. But the RAF campaign is such a mess that it leads only to heartache. Mission objectives are often unclear, and you might fail them even if it seems you complete what the briefing asks of you. Not that failing a mission hinders you: you can continue to the next one regardless of what happens. There are sometimes hilarious disconnects between your actions and those described in the update that follows. For example, one mission has you in the cockpit of a new aircraft for the first time. Your ensuing flight might be flawless, but your superior officer condemns your performance anyway. In another mission, a fellow pilot makes threats that he never attempts to follow through on, and ignores the actions you take in the air, even though the story sets up a very different scenario. To make matters worse, the campaign comes to an abrupt end just when the plot gets interesting; there is no conclusion, and several story threads are left hanging without resolution. Either the campaign wasn't finished or a game-stopping bug brings it to an unintended end.        The RAF campaign's fragile state is seen throughout its presentation, from the way the story boxes start with the scroll bar set to the middle, forcing you to scroll up every time, to the inability to replay these missions once you complete them, to the unintuitive way the menus usher you from one mission to the next. These issues also occur in the second campaign, which is split into three parts and has you fighting for the Luftwaffe in such aircraft as the Ju-87 Stuka. You also encounter mission failures here without ever knowing exactly how you could have avoided them, but this is where history buffs may find the most pleasure in Cliffs of Dover: reenacting historical battles and discovering how the actions they take in the air compare to actual events. You can also take part in stand-alone missions that may involve something as simple as a London sightseeing tour, or a bomber intercept with a lot more action.    IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946 does, though to be fair, that game is the work of years of additional content and fixes applied to the original IL-2 Sturmovik. Nevertheless, Cliffs of Dover is so decrepit that there's no legitimate reason to leave 1946 behind for the new entry, as tempting as it might be to support it. Enthusiasts will likely use the included mission builder and their own talents to fix existing problems and add wonderful new content in the months to come, but that's no excuse for what IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover is now: a solid simulation delivered in a package unfit for consumers.     "
3420,Ace Combat: Joint Assault,8.0,2,"        Whether you go up against the Valahia alone or alongside others, progressing through the campaign does have its rewards. As in other Ace Combat games, you earn money after each successful mission, which can then be spent on new planes. You can also spend money on weapons and parts that improve the power, armor, handling, or combat capabilities of your aircraft. Choosing the right plane for a mission is very important because some are far more effective at dealing with ground forces or air forces, while others are more versatile. (Thankfully, you get a polite warning before launch if the plane you've chosen isn't suited for the current mission.) Your first plane, the F-4E Phantom II, is a fine place to start, but you eventually gain access to planes that make that first one feel downright sluggish. There are more than 40 planes in all, and the variety of aircraft on offer, as well as the way the game gradually doles them out as you progress, helps keep the flying enjoyable throughout and provides a compelling motivation to advance from one mission to the next.

122,Somerville,6.0,1,"Despite aliens existing as one of the most prevalent enemies in video games, seldom do we get to experience them from the vantage point of ants beneath their shoes we may well be. So often, we're tasked with shooting aliens in space battles or gunning them down on the back of military vehicles, and the lack of a proper alien invasion story in the vein of Signs or Invasion of the Body Snatchers has been a personal annoyance for years. For the most part, Somerville finally gives us such a game, but that uncommon setup I've so looked forward to is ultimately hampered by both story and gameplay decisions that keep it from feeling impactful.Created in part by a former Playdead (Inside, Limbo) developer at a new studio called Jumpship, Somerville feels similar to those milestone puzzle-adventures. The color palette favors darkness, the story unfolds without dialogue of any sort, and you'll explore by moving through a world full of threats, solving puzzles to overcome each obstacle and outrun unassailable enemies.In Somerville, you play the patriarch of a family of four which also includes your wife, baby, and dog. It doesn't take long at all for the story to pick up; within minutes, you go from passing out on the couch on a typical evening at home to scrambling for shelter as otherworldly pillars rain down from the sky. Separated from your wife and child, the nameless father and his four-legged friend embark on a quest to reunite with the others.Early on, Somerville feels exactly like what I was hoping for. A filmic opening credits sequence trails the family's car from high above to the tune of emotive music like the first few minutes of The Shining. Going 0 to 60 in a heartbeat feels like the right way to introduce the game's alien threat, too. The characters have no comprehension of what's going on, so neither do you. And the driving force behind the story--reunion and safety--are easy to latch onto. It starts strong.But one of Somerville's early differences from games like it quickly begins to leave it trailing behind predecessors. The game looks like a 2D (or 2.5) adventure, but there's often a lot more space to explore on the Z axis than you might expect, allowing you to move toward or away from the screen. This, in tandem with sometimes unclear pathway design, creates routine issues with depth perception, causing you to bump up against stuff often.In quieter moments, this just means fumbling around a bit inelegantly, but during chase sequences, it often means game over, as such scenes are often designed with the idea that you perfectly squeeze through, over, under, or around each obstacle.A low number of puzzles feels detrimental at times. At four hours long, I was surprised to find the last hour or so is largely void of puzzles. Much of the game is built around a special ability with which the protagonist is imbued--a way of manipulating the alien matter that corrupts the world, allowing him to either liquify or solidify the earth around him. The possibilities for such a mechanic feel obvious as soon as you're given this magic touch, but the game oddly ignores using it in any clever ways for large portions of the game. When it is used, no one puzzle or section of puzzles does much to elevate the mechanic's earliest usages.It's oddly structured in other ways too, though more successfully. The extraterrestrials are varied in shape, size, and function, and as a result they feel collectively unfathomable to human eyes. The game does well to make them feel intimidating by way of their unknowable intentions. While single beings may clearly telegraph they mean you harm, understanding their greater purpose feels like trying to teach a spider to read. It's in this way that Somerville best delivers as an alien game unlike virtually any other in video games--where it aligns with Chiang's Story of Your Life more than Insomniac's Resistance.The game also uses the god-like presence of these beings to mess with spacetime and perception in clever ways I ought not spoil here. Suffice it to say, sometimes what you think you're seeing is not the truth of the matter, and lifting the veil to rediscover reality is a choice that is yours to make more than once in the game.These story beats, uniquely structured and difficult to talk around, are Somerville's greatest attributes. On the contrary, I was surprised to find the more intimate family drama doesn't land as well. Being torn apart from his loved ones early on, the ensuing journey should have been a gutpunch, but reunion winds up taking a backseat to a bigger picture that feels harder to relate to, telling a more familiar story of fomented resistance. At least to that end, the game offers a few sneaky alternate endings--I found three and I suspect there may be more.Tucking away secrets that change your fate provides a satisfying, if unwieldy, layer of player agency in a story where the threat is virtually indecipherable as a species. You can't understand their intentions, and thus, you almost stumble into better or worse endings for yourself. Thankfully, the game allows you to easily see alternate versions of events, which collectively help paint a more vibrant picture of what Somerville is trying to say, even as that message feels only partially delivered by the game's true endpoint.Short games aren't inherently flawed, but Somerville needed a bit more time to convey its major themes. The scope of the alien invasion story looks at both macro and micro relationships among people in ways that only end up scratching the surface of saying something interesting, and though it builds up an interesting universe that leaves me with questions regarding its alien overlords, I was surprised to find in myself an indifference toward finding the truth that's out there."
1621,Last Word,7.0,2," To buy into Last Word’s concept, you need to suspend your disbelief and accept the bizarre power of the spoken word within this otherwise realistic society. The courtly, cultured characters have the gift of gab, constantly spouting long-winded tales of their family names and the distinguished natures of their storied houses. Their words carry unique weight, though, as whoever speaks the last word and “wins” an argument leaves his or her counterpart powerless. You’ll often see NPCs at a door endlessly trading polite “after yous” or “I insists” in fear of letting someone else finish the conversation. This strange societal wrinkle produces plenty of silly moments, but when it comes to actually engaging in longer conversations, the “Discourse” mechanism is anything but simplistic. Think of it as a basic RPG battle, but instead of swinging a blade or blasting enemies with a fireball, you leverage disruptive, submissive, and aggressive forms of banter to push the conversation in your favor. You often open with a disruptive phrase in order to fill up your power meter, followed by something more submissive that spends power to gain tact. Aggressive phrases, which consume stored tact, effect the most change in the conversation bar, so you need to parlay your power into tact before the opportunity to really push the dialogue arises. More and more systems are stacked atop this foundation. A character’s composure changes from collected, to irritated, and eventually to uncivilized, based on a sort of rock-paper-scissors system. Certain actions serve as counters to others, and if you continue to correctly rebut your foil’s last assertion, their composure cracks and eventually shatters. This adds a bit more venom to your aggressive moves, lowering your opponent’s defense and more quickly swaying the conversation meter in your favor. Purchased skills and attributes continue to add bite to your bark, but it takes practice to sharpen your conversational steel and become a true threat. Even with a tutorial that helps you navigate through the dense schemes, Last Word’s Discourse feature is far too opaque early on. All the different tones and meters take time and effort to both understand and intelligently utilize, so you have to bang your head against the systems and fail a few times before the flow of conversations becomes clear. After you learn the ropes, this unique take on turn-based action begins to shine, and the fair-yet-steep difficulty curve gives you ample opportunity to test your tongue. Outside of the conversational duels, the regular discussions you have with the cast are brainy and nimble. Last Word never falls too in love with its aristocratic tone, staying on the right side of ""tongue-in-cheek"" through its intentional pretentiousness. There’s a deep well of text to draw from, too, since the other major mechanism at play surrounds gossiping with your peers about specific hot-button topics. Leveling up these topics by talking to the right person at the right time opens up new narrative avenues, and if you manage to examine each corner of your environment and learn everything you can from its guests, a few interesting wrinkles are added to the last few story sequences. For a game trapped in windowed mode and focused on a single location, Last Word is rich in subsidiary content. On the surface, the characters appear as little more than colored silhouettes, their different hues based on each house of origin. But once you enter a conversation, hand-drawn caricatures appear, sporting expressions and audible squawks that pair well with their personalities. Each member of the small cast has a name as fanciful as their persona--from Whitty Gawship to Professor Chet Chatters. It’s a peculiar world with far too much one-upmanship for anyone to want to live in, but for a four-hour visit, it’s a treat. It isn’t exactly easy to pick up, but the layered Discourse system in Last Word is worth the few verbal jabs and hooks needed in order to master it. The turn-based structure succeeds at supplying a fun alternative to the cavalcade of fantasy RPGs on the market, and while it can be easy to roll your eyes at all the patterned bow ties and discussions of fine wines, the posh tenor never tips so far that it becomes pretentious. Last Word shows that you don’t need a towering sword or a 15-minute summoning sequence to create an exciting battle system--sometimes it just takes a sharp script and an even sharper tongue."
3321,Call of Duty: Black Ops,9.0,2,"      Your interrogation-fueled flashbacks are not beholden to the linear flow of time, allowing your missions cover a wide variety of geography and gameplay. A dramatic breakout from a brutal Soviet prison is one early highlight, and later missions feature frontline conflicts, urban firefights, and mountainous incursions. The environments are richly detailed, and though the campaign is not without a few technical hiccups (like occasionally problematic checkpoint markers and the odd teleporting ally), these moments aren't likely to hinder your enjoyment. In addition to the on-foot action, you use a number of vehicles to achieve your objectives. Some put you in the gunner's seat while others put you behind the wheel, and though the vehicle handling is unremarkable, the thrill of blowing stuff up and speeding through hostile terrain is undeniable. The core running-and-gunning mechanics remain as exciting as ever, and the gameplay variety throughout the campaign keeps the action moving at a great clip.          Call of Duty points also enable two cool new mechanics, the first of which is contracts. These are like the many multiplayer challenges that reward you with experience points for completing combat goals, only you have to pay to complete them. If you do so within the allotted time period, you receive a tidy payout. For example, if you pay 50 points for the stab-a-guy-in-the-back contract and make good, you'll earn 100 points for your troubles. If time expires before you get stabby, you're out 50 points. Tougher contracts cost more, but they also have bigger payouts (get five headshots without dying, cost: 250 points; payout: 3,500 points and 3,500 experience). You can have up to three contracts active at a time across three different categories, and the available contracts change regularly, potentially ensuring a good amount of variety as the weeks pass. Contracts offer a nicely incentivized version of challenges and can give you something fun to strive for if you get in a rut, but don't expect these small gambles to make you rich.      Call of Duty: World at War has returned. The fight to stay alive against wave after wave of shambling undead is still a tense and bizarre endeavor, and new maps and playable characters take the oddball humor of the situation to a whole new level. Nevertheless, at its core, this is the same frenzied action as found in its predecessor, and each play-through quickly begins to feel much like the last. This is the only proper cooperative mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops, supporting four players online or two locally. Two local players can also play split-screen competitive multiplayer online, while four can divide the screen equally among them and set up competitive local matches.      There are two new modes that help make Black Ops the most fully featured Call of Duty game yet. Combat Training simulates a competitive multiplayer environment with AI opponents and allows you to set the enemy difficulty to match your skill level. You gain experience and unlock gear in the same way, and though this progress only applies within Combat Training, it's a great way to get the excitement and challenge of competitive multiplayer without submitting to the vicious predations of actual humans. The other new mode is the Theater, which lets you view replays of your games, take screenshots, and edit clips to share with the community. You can string together a number of different segements from a given game, and even render a video lasting up to 30 seconds for upload to the web, though the rendering feature is not fully functional at launch. Reliving moments--both glorious and shameful--is a lot of fun, and the community has already started cranking out content for your viewing pleasure. And though it may only apply to a small percentage of the population at this point, you can also play Call of Duty: Black Ops in stereoscopic 3D, providing you have the proper cables, required glasses, and a compatible television. The effect is novel and fairly intriguing, though it takes a significant mental adjustment and may not be comfortable for many players.         While it may not take the signature Call of Duty action to dizzying new heights, Black Ops is a thoroughly excellent game. New modes and mechanics give a jolt of energy to the lively competitive multiplayer, and the engrossing new campaign develops into one of the best in the series. Combat training allows anyone to enjoy the thrills of arena combat and the satisfaction of leveling up, and the opportunities for cooperative play, local competition, and community video creation provide even more outlets for entertainment. Call of Duty: Black Ops lives up to the top-notch pedigree that the series has earned, giving players an awesome new shooter to enjoy just in time for the holidays.      "
3359,Lost Planet 2,7.0,2,"   Lost Planet, including the prologue, which features great Lost Planet standbys: giant mechs known as vital suits (or VSs), enormous aliens called akrid with glowing orange spots (hint: shoot them!), and snow flying everywhere. In other levels, red light bathes industrial corridors, lightning flashes brightly above a turbulent sea, and cyclones sweep across the desert plains. There are plenty of beautiful vistas to take in and many attempts to vary the pace. Over the course of the game, you will rush through the desert on a roaring speeder, defy gravity in the blackness of space, and bring down a giant akrid from the inside. Lost Planet 2 is absolutely stunning on the PC, particularly if you own a video card that can handle its fancy DirectX 11 effects, yet it runs surprisingly well on a medium-powered machine, even with many of the options cranked up.      The early levels have some weird pacing idiosyncrasies. They take just a few minutes to complete, too often coming to an end just as things appear to be picking up. Eventually, the action settles into a better rhythm, and you begin to pick up on Lost Planet 2's various delights and quirks. Perhaps the game's greatest claim to fame is its frequent boss battles versus the giant akrid that often loom above you. In one level, that might mean a giant multi-limbed creature rising from the water; in another, it's two lizardlike beasts paralyzing you with sonic bursts, and then lumbering in your general direction. Like its predecessor, Lost Planet 2 is big on knockback attacks. Monsters might send you flying backward, which can be frustrating, because it takes control away from you while you wait for your character to get back up. However, animation times seem to have been adjusted, and other elements have been changed to make for a much better experience. For example, the sonic attacks in that aforementioned dual akrid battle are much less frequent than in the console versions, which means you spend more time shooting and less time scowling while hammering on the keys that let you break free from paralysis.       The most notable improvements come into play in a level involving a speeding train under attack by a gigantic akrid worm. On consoles, you had to deal with a number of awful design elements during this level, such as absolutely putrid friendly AI, total communication failures, and an infuriating pair of turrets. Instead of dealing with a horrific barrage of missiles, you now set your sights on a flying gunship, which is a lot more fun than getting knocked off of a train over and over again. Your teammates, while still occasionally brain-dead, are less likely to run in place against a train door that won't open. (Too bad your humanoid foes are still as dumb as a box of rocks.) And the final stage of this level, in which you have to load a giant cannon, extinguish fires, and man side turrets, now identifies what you must do via a robotic voice-over and interface markings. This act's first sequence, which you can easily exploit by running to the rear of the train with a sniper rifle, is a total bore, but the rest of the act lets you enjoy the dusty environments as they rush by, all while sniping enemies from afar and mowing them down from within a clanging mech suit.      In light of the imperfect AI, it's best if you grab a few friends or strangers to join you in online cooperative play. Some fights, particularly against the giant bosses, are almost epic this way, particularly with a full contingent of players. One player gets in one of the many different types of mech suits, another rides on the mech's side, and others pummel the oozing creature above with rockets. Yet even co-op play doesn't turn out to be as simple as you'd want. There is no drop-in, drop-out play, so you can't join a friend already in progress. More importantly, you can't join a buddy at all if you haven't already played to that point. (If you want your buddy to help you through the train level but he's only in episode 2, it's a no-go.) The respawn system, which gives players a limited number of lives to share, can still be a frustration, but because the knockbacks here aren't as prevalent as in the other versions, it's a minor point.        Like most of Lost Planet's visual aspects, the cutscenes look great and convey a great deal of action-movie gusto. Unfortunately, they don't tell much of a tale. The original Lost Planet was not big in the story department, but it still made the attempt, and at least you got to know a few of its leading players. Lost Planet 2 doesn't even try. Its characters are nameless and have no discernable personality. A group of speeder-piloting bandits are apparently meant to inject a bit of humor, but they come across as embarrassing racial stereotypes. Without any character development, proper story exposition, or a better antagonist than a faceless corporation you know little about, there's no reason to care about the fate of this attractive world.       Competitive multiplayer is another reason to visit this planet. There are a robust number of modes here, along with an intriguing and occasionally silly system of persistent rewards meant to keep you invested. Many of the modes are shooter standards: Elimination, Team Elimination, and variants on two-flag Capture the Flag and Conquest, called Akrid Egg Battle and Data Post Battle, respectively. Fugitive mode has returned as well and pits a small team of lightly armed fugitives avoiding capture against a fully equipped team of hunters. Some modes come in several variants as well. For example, Team Elimination victory conditions can be customized so that the first team to use up a set number of respawns loses, or the victory might go to the team with the highest point total. These modes can be further customized by the host in a number of ways, from setting the default weapon types, to setting the number of mech suits on the map. Some of the mechanical drawbacks of the campaign are still an annoyance. For example, getting hit in the midst of throwing a grenade interrupts your toss. But the vertically designed maps and cool mechanical monstrosities can lead to some enjoyable shoot-outs.   Chromehounds and EndWar. The game also offers a problematic but intriguing system of persistent rewards to keep you invested. The crux of this system is the points you earn while playing, which in turn can be spent on a chance to earn something useful at the game's slot machine. Rewards include new weapons you can add to your default loadout, passive bonuses to equip, and new parts for customizing your character. They also include emotes and titles, called ""noms de guerre."" It's an intriguing system, but over time it lends itself to disappointment. Unlocking a new shotgun for multiplayer matches is cool, but most of the time, you're getting a new nom de guerre or an emote. So now you can run around with the words ""lookin' for love"" floating over your head and perform a new kind of fist pump. Customizing your weapons and appearance is great, but the more useless rewards make this system feel unnecessarily padded.        In spite of its occasional awkwardness, Lost Planet 2 is a worthy offering for shooter fans who enjoy the awe-inspiring sight of a colossal creature towering above them. It's good to see this game's better elements getting their fair dues, even if some of the other core issues weren't so readily repaired. The gameplay oddities and small online population keep this celestial object from shining too brightly, but if you're interested in shooting big bugs on a resplendent sci-fi world, or just want to show your friends what your fancy new video card is capable of, then Lost Planet 2 is an entertaining way to pass the hours.     "
964,Secret of Mana,6.0,1,"Secret of Mana tells the tale of a spiky-haired boy named Randi who frees a mystical sword stuck in a stone. Instead of his home village giving him the King Arthur treatment, Randi is admonished for accidentally undoing the balance of the magical forces in the world. Monsters, an evil empire, and a world-ending dragon threaten to ruin the world as they know it, unless Randi can find the mystical Mana seeds and use his sword to restore order.It's a fairly rudimentary tale of swords and sorcery, but one that's easy to see through to the end thanks to the cast's charming personalities. Newly written dialogue for the remake smooths out the original translation's rough edges, and introduces a few completely new scenes, where Randi and his cohorts--Primm and Popoi--hang out and talk over dinner every time you book a night at an inn. The remake sees our characters learn to know and love each other in new ways, and it makes a big difference in the long run.The biggest change, of course, is the complete graphical overhaul, putting it on par with I Am Setsuna and some of the better Final Fantasy mobile ports. It maintains the original game's striking color palette, bathing the world in vibrant greens, blues and pinks. Most environments look delightful, but particularly dazzling locales like the Sprite Forest and Ice Country are breathtaking. Character models are a step up from Square Enix's previous remakes as well, though the decision to introduce voice actors yet not let characters' lips move is a jarring one. The fact that the voice acting is played so campy and cheesy--in both English and Japanese--doesn't help.The remixed score is the same two-steps-forward one-step-back situation. For the most part, the expanded instrumentation works well. Some areas, like Matango and its '70s prog-rock theme, introduce surprisingly catchy tunes. The score keeps the original freewheeling approach as the world design, with no limits on what a particular dungeon or area might be accompanied by. But this occasionally leads to one too many strange, dissonant moments, with many of the village themes defined by the heavy use of bagpipes and accordions.Secret of Mana's ""anything goes"" approach extends to gameplay as well. You can swap control between the three characters at any time, and they are each capable of wielding any of the game's eight weapon types. Each strike during combat initiates a recharge time where the chances of actually landing your next attack or doing decent damage improve as your character regathers their energy. This system forces you to move around the playing field as much as possible to avoid getting hit by enemies while you wait. Magic attacks can hit from anywhere, as long as your enemy is in range, but magic points are limited, and items that refill the meter are expensive. There aren't many console RPGs from the early '90s that forced you to consider so many things at once, but in 2018, it actually feels right at home.There are, however, quite a few aspects that are less welcome by modern standards, and despite a golden opportunity to do so, nothing has been done to address them. The Ring system--the game's quick menu--is serviceable, but the color-coding used to indicate whose options, weapons, and magic you're accessing is too subtle for its own good; it gets worse as your repertoire grows over the course of the game.It's also still extremely easy for your crew to get surrounded by lesser enemies during combat, getting smacked around from all directions with nowhere to go. Yet if you walk into another room where huge, dangerous enemies are lurking, you can often stroll right past them without raising alarm. Sometimes, the NPC A.I. being oblivious is a good thing. When that same obliviousness applies to the CPU controlled characters in your crew during a major battle, and your offensive spell caster is stuck behind a doorway, it's an unforgivable annoyance.The original game's Grid System, where you could adjust how aggressive/passive you wanted your A.I. characters to be, is gone. In its place is a much more simplified system of dictating basic behavior, but there's not an effective way to instruct your allies to favor self preservation. Granted, that's a problem easily solved with the game's local multiplayer, where two friends can jump in at any point and control the other two characters in your crew--another area where Secret of Mana was way ahead of its time--but it's still no excuse for the issues experienced while playing solo.Altogether, the new Secret of Mana exists in a weird nexus of being a forward-thinking RPG that occasionally shows its age, or a very modern RPG with some baffling design decisions and sub-standard A.I..Other problems the original game didn't have, however, stem from the lack of general information. The Super Nintendo release came with a full-fledged world map and a manual which explained what store items were meant to do, and where certain cities were located in reference to major landmarks. The latter is critical once Flammie, a friendly dragon, comes into play, allowing you to travel anywhere in the world at will. None of that is included here, which could very well create a problem for newcomers since there's no place in-game that explains what anything does. That disconnect extends to weapons and armor, where there's no way to know whether a piece of equipment is better or worse than what a character is already wearing aside from buying it anyway and praying.Altogether, the new Secret of Mana exists in a weird nexus of being a forward-thinking RPG that occasionally shows its age, or a very modern RPG with some baffling design decisions and sub-standard A.I.. Its ambitions, coupled with the outright charm of the world, are certainly more than many RPGs offer, and very few as visually dazzling as this. Secret of Mana remains an adventure worth taking, as long as you're prepared for a bumpy ride."
4579,Athens 2004,4.0,0," When Athens 2004 hit the PlayStation 2 in July of this year, it seemed like a fairly uninspired but somewhat necessary exercise. The summer games had arrived, someone needed to make a new video game following in the tradition of Track &amp; Field, and Eurocom was saddled with the task. Now it's November--time for the heavy winter coats and long nights--and in a rather baffling move, Athens 2004 is just now appearing on the PC. Aside from showing up well after the party is over, Athens 2004 for the PC has been gutted of its four-player support, as well as some of the more enjoyable minigames found in the considerably more relevant PlayStation 2 version.      Comparisons to Track &amp; Field are easy to make here, simply because Athens 2004 is little more than a collection of athletically inclined minigames. There are 20 different events for you to compete in, and there are a variety of different ways for you to do so. There's a handy practice mode, which is absolutely essential for understanding the somewhat cryptic nuances of a few of the games. You can choose to compete in a one-off event or in a series of events, such as a decathlon or a heptathlon. If the prefabricated competitions don't suit your liking, you can also generate your own custom competition by cherry-picking the events that you enjoy the most. A big part of the appeal of Athens 2004 on the PlayStation was that it nurtured the inherently competitive nature of the games with full four-player support. This has been knocked down to two players on the PC, though single-system multiplayer just feels kind of out of place on the PC.   The events themselves include a decent cross section of competitions from the summer Olympic Games, including dashes of various lengths, hurdles, the long jump, the high jump, the triple jump, the pole vault, the discus throw, the javelin throw, the shot put, aquatic races of various lengths, weight lifting, archery, and skeet shooting. Gone is the equestrian competition, which felt like a really strange choice when it appeared in the PlayStation 2 version to begin with, but the complete absence of gymnastic events stands out as a big omission, especially considering the incredible popularity of those events in the real Olympic Games. The mechanics of most of the games in Athens 2004 boil down to mashing two buttons as fast as you can and occasionally tapping a third. But despite this extreme simplicity, the game's implementation of abstract, esoteric meters can make some of the events needlessly confusing, simply because there is not often an obvious correlation between what the meter represents and what's happening onscreen. Although what you're seeing onscreen changes, you don't get much sense of variety in the actual gameplay between these events.   Once you figure out the game's cryptic interfaces, it's just a matter of endurance. The game is an absolute nightmare on the fingers. Few other games these days are so demanding of continuous, rapid-fire button pressing, so if you're not used to this type of mechanic, you may well find yourself with cramped hands after playing Athens 2004.   By general standards, Athens 2004 isn't a good-looking game, though it is the most technically accomplished Olympic video game to date. Considering that the last time a comparable product came to the PC was with Eidos' miserable Sydney 2000, it's not much of a feat. To its credit, the game has a tidy look to it, and though it's fairly economic with the polygons, there are a few nice touches, such as the wobble in the high-jump bar as you pass over it, or the long-distance runners that continue to run laps in the background during various other track-and-field events. The game helps cement a TV-broadcast feel by constantly switching to different camera angles over the course of an event, and it makes liberal use of instant replays. The biggest problem with the graphics in Athens 2004 lies in the athlete models. Though the game lets you play as nameless, young athletes from literally dozens and dozens of countries around the world, the athletes all have exactly the same build, and they only alternate between a few different facial types and skin tones. This leaves you with a lot of really generic-looking athletes who often don't really look like they're from the country that they're supposed to be representing. The overall presentation doesn't hold up as well on the PC as it did on the PlayStation 2, largely because the textures haven't been enhanced any, revealing a lot of muddiness at higher resolutions that you simply couldn't see on a standard TV.       The sound is fairly subdued, with a few, occasionally silly-sounding, athletic grunts playing over some simple crowd noise loops. You'll also hear the crack of the starting gun, and you can hear the field announcer echoing through the park. Additionally, you're treated to an English-accented TV-style commentator. The commentator doesn't have a huge number of clips to draw from, and so he often ends up repeating himself. Occasionally his commentary isn't appropriate for the action, but he manages to mostly remain contextual and relevant. There are a few short clips of rock and funk that play during the instant replays, and there's a sort of regal-sounding tune that plays over the main menus. This is about the extent of the music that you can expect to hear in the game.    Athens 2004 is a lousy port of a console game of middling quality. The timing of its release is almost more of a liability than its technical aptitude, making Athens 2004 for the PC almost wholly irrelevant. The simplistic button-mash that comprises most of the gameplay at least felt a bit at home on the PlayStation 2, but the absolute lack of depth becomes apparent much more quickly when you're spending almost the entire game hitting three buttons on a full keyboard. Even if your fondness for the 2004 Olympic Games is at the level of mania, there's no defensible reason to buy Athens 2004.   "
2962,Inazuma Eleven,6.0,1,"FIFA and Football Manager have been doing it to a smaller extent for years. The sport itself isn't dissimilar to a role-playing game either. Players train to raise their stats, managers recruit new members into the ""party,"" and statistics fly fast and furious. The footballing world doesn't feature giant burning dragons or ludicrous conspiracy plots like Inazuma Eleven does--well, not the giant dragons anyway--but the marriage of football and role-playing game is definitely a logical one. The problem with Inazuma Eleven isn't that it combines two unexpected genres, but rather that it does very little to play to the strengths of either genre. It's pleasant, with an endearing plot, but it doesn't capture the thrill of football. There are a host of issues, ranging from fiddly controls to an erratic difficulty curve, compounded by the feel of repetition throughout. It may be charming, but that charm alone isn't enough to win you over.       really loves football. Sporting a look which falls somewhere between Chris Waddle and the Karate Kid, and with the voice of Luke Triton, Mark serves as a refreshingly upbeat protagonist surrounded by characters who just can't be bothered. It's a typical underdog story--lazy, apathetic footballers whipped into shape by circumstance and Mark's own determination. And the story plays out much as you'd expect from a Japanese role-playing game. Characters with names like Axel Blaze and Kevin Dragonfly find themselves caught up in a tale of conspiracy, intrigue, and suspicious maids. It's suitably silly, and from the outset it's clear this is not a realistic take on football.      The primary hook of Inazuma Eleven is building your team, recruiting new players, training them up, and then facing off against a variety of teams in both a national and a regional tournament. The collection aspect is reminiscent of games like Pokemon, but also of the Panini football sticker books, and Inazuma attempts to play on the compulsion to collect. The desire to fill your team roster (100 slots out of a possible 1,000-plus players in the game) is forced to stand alone here, though. There's little incentive to recruit more than a handful of players in regard to actually improving your team. Good players are either with you from the beginning or recruited as part of the story, so whether you make an effort to recruit a lot more depends on how interested you are in simply collecting things. Later on, recruitable players have more to offer, but again, it's not mandatory that you acquire them.      Actually playing football is initially a complex affair. There are numerous stats to consider for each player, such as guard ability, kick power, speed, and guts. They also have FP (stamina) and TP (mana) gauges. FP depletes the more a player performs basic actions, such as sprinting. TP is consumed by using one of the game's special moves. Each player also has an elemental label; air, wood, fire, or earth. This provides an additional strength or weakness against players of a different element and can also serve to power up special moves if the corresponding player element matches the move's element. Unfortunately, the complexity of the system appears to make little difference when playing through the story. You could spend hours tailoring your lineup to suit each individual adversary, but when you can quite comfortably win 5-0 with almost no thought, there's little point.         On the field, the action is controlled entirely with the stylus. You can direct players where to go, or they'll approximate the best path to take, although if you choose the latter option, they often run wildly away from the ball or stand still for no apparent reason. When engaging a player for a tackle or block, you're presented with one of two options; the first has a low success rate but often results in you retaining control of the ball when it does work, while the second has a higher change of success but generally puts some distance between you and the ball. There are also special moves which can be learned or acquired over the course of the game, with categories for guard, defense, tackling, and shooting. You can also tap a player to sprint, but making a mad dash for the goal never works. One-touch is the order of the day, passing the ball around the pitch until your striker is in a suitable position. In that sense, it's realistic and feels natural, but the lack of any more precise control leads to a strange feeling of disempowerment. Occasionally, especially early on, it feels as if you have little control over the outcome of the match. Particularly annoying is the fouling, as you often seem to get called out for a foul based on the whim of the game rather than any logical statistical calculation.       Matches themselves take on two forms. The first consists of small, four-a-side meetings which serve as the game's random battles. You play against everyone, from the baseball club to the ""lazy go home"" club, all of which are seemingly as adept at football as the actual football club. At least at first. Initially these random battles serve as a great way to level up your team and earn some prestige points (the game's equivalent of money), but they gradually become tiresome, with matches often taking longer to initialize than actually play. They have different objectives, such as score the first goal or get the ball off the opposing team, but after the first couple of chapters, none of them pose any real challenge, and they offer little in the way of reward. On top of this, recovering your team's FP and TP costs an increasing number of prestige points, so occasionally when you're on the way to an important match and get assailed by numerous chess club members, the cost outweighs the benefits.         The 11-a-side matches are more exciting but are not without their own problems. Initially, the story mode matches are scripted to the point of absurdity, with one particularly abhorrent example near the beginning requiring you to perform the exact moves the game wants you to, at the exact time it demands. It's completely counterintuitive to the idea of playing free-flowing football and serves as a ludicrously off-putting difficulty spike so early on. Thankfully, after that, things ease up a bit, with most story matches requiring a single specific move to be performed initially before things open up and you can just play.      Matches are fun despite the occasional lack of control, and emerging victorious is quite rewarding, although more because of the characters' enthusiasm than because winning presents any real challenge. Slotting four goals into the back of the net without conceding any does get old, so some of the later gimmicks (such as having your stats reduced to 1 due to food poisoning) are welcome in that they force you to mix your tactics up a bit. Any story match can be replayed as a friendly, which means the gimmicks are removed and you just engage in a bit of football, and these are great for boosting your team and enjoying the matches themselves.      Outside of the football, Raimon Junior High and the surrounding town are fun to explore. Finding training spots to boost individual stats, talking to the weird non-player characters hanging around, and discovering chests with new moves are enjoyable diversions. The 2D sprites on 3D backgrounds look great on the small screen, and the jaunty jingles that play as you and your three buddies trail around are upbeat and positive. But it's just not enough. Mark's enthusiasm and the overarching plot might be interesting, but none of it is compelling. There's the option to face your team off against a friend locally, and you can download new players and items via wi-fi, but there's just not enough here to keep you playing for long.         There's no denying that developer Level-5 has hit on a good idea with the Inazuma Eleven series. The amalgamation of football management and silly RPG plot is enjoyable enough, but the matches are all over the place. The initial difficulty spike is off-putting, and the fact that it leads into a game which is largely too easy is even odder. Inazuma Eleven is definitely fun for a while, but the lasting appeal depends entirely on how happy you are collecting players and repeating the same few tactics over and over. It's far from an own goal, but it's not the victory it could have been.   "
3010,Catherine,8.0,2,"  Catherine isn't like other video games. It isn't about saving the world, rescuing a princess, or slaughtering scores of nameless troops. It is, instead, about a regular guy in over his head. That guy is Vincent, a soft-spoken man so afraid of confrontation that he refuses to take control of events that change the course of his life. During the day, Vincent's attempts to make sense of his romantic entanglements lead to fear and desperation. At night, that desperation translates to cruel nightmares in which Vincent scrambles up an increasingly complex tower of emotions. Would you have guessed that Catherine is a puzzle game from such a premise? Yet, this is no ordinary puzzle game. Both Catherine's story and gameplay are so stimulating that they allow you to share in Vincent's increasing alarm as he struggles to find balance in his life--and to stay alive in his terrifying dreams. The game's difficulty can prove daunting, and scattered camera and control quirks sometimes hinder the fun. But if you've got the right amount of courage and stamina, Catherine rewards you with an unusual experience you aren't apt to forget.        Vincent isn't a typical hero. He isn't interested in greatness. If anything, he'd rather keep things just as they are: He thrives on status quo. His girlfriend Katherine (with a ""K"") wants to get married, which is a prospect that Vincent hardly embraces, either outwardly or inwardly. Faced with a decision he'd rather not make, Vincent relaxes at his favorite bar, The Stray Sheep, where he meets another girl, Catherine (with a ""C""). Catherine is the polar opposite of Katherine. Catherine is perky and fun loving, while Katherine is focused and grounded. Catherine represents fun and freedom; Katherine represents comfort and commitment. After his meeting with this seductress, Vincent wakes the next morning--with her next to him in bed. Thus, Vincent's staid life is disrupted by this vivacious woman who soon proves to have a severe jealous streak. Vincent better not cheat on her, she proclaims; who knows what might happen? And Vincent, petrified by this sinister turn--while still intrigued by her ample physical assets--is scared into inaction.         Catherine is the work of the same team that developed the Persona role-playing games. And though Catherine is not an RPG, if you've played the Persona games, some elements here will be familiar. Most notably, the day is separated into two vastly different portions. While Vincent is awake, you roam about The Stray Sheep. Here, you chat with your friends and strangers in the booths and at the bar. The elderly twins at The Stray Sheep have some cryptic comments for you (""Would you like to speak to Lindsay?"" ""Would you like to speak to Martha?""), and television newscasts and conversation threads discuss mysterious local deaths that seem connected to Vincent's haunted nightmares. You also receive text messages on your cell phone from both of your ladies-in-waiting. Opening a text from Katherine is accompanied by a whispered sigh; opening one from Catherine rings out a tinkling giggle. These effects encapsulate the women's traits effectively, cramming their entire personalities (and Vincent's perception of them) into a single audio cue. But you don't just mull over these texts when you receive them: You also reply by choosing from a series of canned sentences.      How you respond to these texts and the choices you make during other opportunities influence a morality meter of sorts. This isn't the typical good-versus-bad meter you find in other games, however; it's more of a freedom-versus-order meter. Responses that favor Catherine are on the chaotic side; those favoring Katherine are more disciplined. Where you stand on this meter determines how Vincent reacts to certain situations during cutscenes--and it also helps determine which one of the multiple endings you receive. The angel/devil graphic that pops up every time the meter is evoked is intrusive. Nevertheless, it's refreshing to see the ideas of good and bad cast aside in favor of less judgmental attitudes. Vincent might be cheating, but he's not a bad guy (nor an innocent one). Most games focusing on polar-opposite morals make it easy to follow a good or evil path; you just choose to be one or the other and select actions that obviously push the meter in that direction. Catherine isn't so cut and dry, and as a result, you are more likely to answer honestly, rather than ""game"" the system.        Vincent's fears come to a head once he staggers home from The Stray Sheep and falls asleep. Thus begins the second portion of your day: Vincent's nightmares. In his nightmares, Vincent carries a pillow, is clad only in his boxer shorts, and has sheep horns fastened to the side of his head. At the start of each dream, half-sheep Vincent appears at the bottom of a tall tower of blocks. Your goal is to climb to the exit at the top by pushing and pulling these blocks into arrangements that allow passage. Sound simple? After the introductory levels, it's terrifying. Levels are separated into such telling themes as ""Inquisition"" and ""Prison of Despair."" Torture devices and the symbols of Mars and Venus hang above ledges splattered with dark-red blood. Bleating sheep cling to icy blocks as they swirl about the gigantic chamber, lit by the sunlight seeping through stained-glass windows. All the while, remixes of dramatic and popular classical music sound forth, urging you upward. The works chosen--Dvorak's New World Symphony, Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, and others--are common in symphonic halls the world over. Much of the music is discordant or rhythmically unusual, which elicits the right degree of tension. And each piece is absolutely apt; Borodin's Polovtsian Dances, for example, features a climbing-and-falling theme that perfectly mirrors the gameplay.        It isn't just the atmosphere that makes climbing these towers so intense. The puzzles are deviously constructed, each one making it more difficult to figure out how to arrange blocks in ways that allow you to reach the pinnacle. You have to think from the top down, often many steps ahead, which isn't a simple task. But you don't get all the time in the world to figure it out. The tower is slowly falling to pieces under you and forces you to stay on the move. Each level is a pressure cooker, threatening to boil over if you take too long or box yourself into a situation impossible to escape. You collect pillows that are used as continues, encounter one or two checkpoints on your way up, and can undo a certain number of moves. But even then, on medium and hard difficulties, Catherine is wickedly difficult. Later puzzles are hard enough to exhaust you, featuring ice blocks that cause you to slide off ledges, bombs that cause nearby blocks to crumble, and monster blocks that lick you to death if you hang from them. The emotion you can expect to experience while playing? Panic.       And that's just while playing standard levels. End-chapter bosses terrorize you further, threatening to stab you with forks or rain down hearts on you that reverse your controls. These boss levels also tend to move the camera around to give you a good look at the monstrosity chasing you up the tower. These shifts play with your perspective to the game's detriment; such indulgences shouldn't come at the price of a useful camera view. Even in standard stages, the camera can be a nuisance, given that Vincent can climb behind blocks and become difficult or even impossible to see, even when panning the camera around as far as it will go. The controls, too, might occasionally get in the way. They're generally fine, but if Vincent is in the middle of an animation, he may not immediately respond to your button press. In a hurry, you might move a different block than the one you intended. The resulting challenge is sometimes exhausting. If you find Catherine overly difficult, you can play on easy, though ""easy"" isn't the same as ""cakewalk."" And should you find yourself stuck on a level in the middle of the stage, you'll have to quit out and return to The Stray Sheep because only there can you change the difficulty level.      In Catherine, however, hard work reaps great rewards. When Vincent inches closer to his destination, a clanging bell signals his coming triumph. Once he reaches the top, Vincent cries out in elation--and so will you. The puzzles are fiendish but not impossible, and solving the tougher ones makes you feel incredibly smart. You get a tally of how well you did based on how quickly you climbed, how many piles of gold you collected on the way up, and the like. Then you receive a medal--bronze, silver, or gold--while listening to the joyous refrains of the ""Hallelujah Chorus."" Before you move to the next level, you enter a foyer populated by anthropomorphic sheep where you can save your game and catch your breath. Who are these sheep? Why do they insist that they are normal and you're the monster? You eventually make connections between the real world and that of your dreams.        Before you leave this safe area and move to the next tower, you enter a claustrophobic confessional, where a disembodied voice forces you to answer a question before continuing. These questions affect your freedom/order meter. And again, because there's no clear good or bad answer, you may be tempted to answer honestly. Some of these questions are straightforward. (""Is it easier to love or to be loved?"") Others are ludicrous. (""Would you have sex with a ghost if it were attractive enough?"") One nice touch: If you reload and play a stage again, the questions are different, giving the impression that there must be loads of them. Another nice touch: A pie graph shows you how other players answered.      There's more to Catherine than its single-player campaign. If you earn enough gold medals (not an easy task), you unlock randomly created trial levels for one or two players. And if you finish the campaign, you unlock a short-lived but hysterical competitive mode. It's a shame the barrier to unlock this mode is so high because it's a blast to find ways to hinder your opponent while racing to the top of your shared tower. And to make the proceedings even more absurd, the announcer offers bizarre suggestions. (""Players must now refrain from using the word 'the' while playing this round."") But such silliness is the exception in Catherine, rather than the rule. This story-heavy puzzler is mature and occasionally profound, exploring themes like sexual fidelity, personal responsibility, and trust. Catherine doesn't just challenge your hand/eye coordination: It challenges your intellect and your emotions.     "
3514,Disney/Pixar Toy Story 3,7.0,2,"       The eight levels of the story take only a few hours to play through, but there is a lot more content in the Toy Box mode. This is an open-world adventure that allows you to take on missions from various characters and customize a town to your liking. Missions have you doing all sorts of different activities: tossing farm animals down a well to earn a special gold star; throwing dynamite at a mountain to carve your favorite characters' faces in the rock; or chucking army men off of roofs to get them to parachute onto a target. There are races to take part in (of both the car and the horse variety), still pictures to re-create, and mayoral elections to rig. These bite-size challenges can be completed in just a few minutes, letting you quickly move on to a new activity if you aren't having much fun capturing criminals or rescuing aliens. None of these activities are deep, but there are so many on offer that it's easy to lose hours trying to make every citizen happy.     Toy Story movies, either. You can dress your people up as Wall-E or put Nemo fins on the sides of your buildings if the desert theme seems a bit dry. Being able to color your citizens and buildings however you like lets you inject a bit of your own personality into the game, but that's sadly as far as the customization options go. You can't actually set up your own obstacle course or race track, so it's just a matter of unlocking everything you can instead of crafting your own. Still, there is a lot of content here, and it's easy to get sucked into completing missions and buying new toys.     The impressive number of unlockable goodies gives this game a lot of replay value. Every level from the story mode contains hidden items, and you will most likely need to visit stages a few times to find everything there is. Toy Box mode has extra outfits and bonus characters strewn about the large map, giving you a worthwhile reason to get off the beaten path to find those lost items. There is a two-player mode as well that lets another player hop in at any time. The split-screen action can make fast-paced race sequences a little more difficult to complete, but exploration with a friend by your side is even more fun than going through the game alone.      Toy Story 3 may not be able to reach the lofty heights of Pixar's movies, but it is a fun game for youngsters who want to play around in this colorful world. The variety of activities ensures there is something new to see in every level, and though none of the missions are deep, they do offer plenty of simple fun. Control issues lead to a number of unavoidable deaths, but the forgiving checkpoint ensures that you won't have to backtrack much if you end up in a bottomless pit. Toy Story 3 has a lot of content and provides a good time for players eager to spend a few more hours with Woody and Buzz.  "
2275,Gone Home,10.0,2,"     The X-Files will be on. But you don't need an emotional connection to the era to appreciate just how well Gone Home captures the texture of the time period; it draws you in through the sheer precision and authenticity of its details.       The '90s aren't just a background for Gone Home's story. Instead, the game is believably rooted in that era; the explosive popularity of Street Fighter II factors into Sam's friendships, and the huge Oliver Stone-fueled resurgence in JFK conspiracy theories impacts Terry's literary fortunes. Tapes you can listen to featuring music by riot grrrl acts like Bratmobile and Heavens to Betsy flesh out not just the time period, but your understanding of Sam as a person. Meanwhile, the game's excellent ambient score creates the sense that the entire house is thrumming with energy, despite being empty at the moment.     As you explore the house and find out what the Greenbriars have been going through, there are no puzzles to solve, no enemies to defeat. There's nothing to take you out of your journey of discovery. Instead, everything you find just reinforces the feeling that the place you're exploring is a real one, inhabited by real people. So much of the story is in the details; almost every letter or form or other document you can pick up and examine reveals something about the inner lives of one of the Greenbriars, and it's wonderful how the game respects your intelligence enough to let you piece things together yourself, rather than spelling everything out for you.      A form Jan submits requesting the permanent transfer of a colleague to her office speaks of trouble in the Greenbriars' marriage, for instance, while the notes Sam has exchanged with her classmate Lonnie, packed as they are with humorous doodles and cracks about teachers, portray the developing connection between the two of them in a way that rings incredibly true. These items aren't like the audio logs and journal entries you find in so many games that are clearly left around just to give you, the player, some narrative context. These feel like the authentic products of people going about the business of living their lives, which you just happen to be there to discover.      Gone Home executes on its ambitions flawlessly. The things in the Greenbriars' home take on an emotional heft as you come to understand the stories they tell, and although they're absent, you feel the presence of the Greenbriars all around you. Gone Home is an important game because it does something games rarely do: it tells a believable story, grounded in the real world, that focuses on women and treats all of its characters, women and men alike, as complex individuals. But the reason to play Gone Home is not for its importance. It's for the elegance with which its tale is constructed and communicated, and the captivating way that it makes you an active participant in peeling back the layers of one family's ordinary lives as their home tells you their stories. Like many of our own memories, those stories cut deep.   "
449,Surgeon Simulator 2: Access All Areas,6.0,1,"Played from a first-person perspective, Surgeon Simulator 2 is far closer to a wobbly puzzle game than a proper simulation--albeit one with tongue firmly planted in cheek. In addition to performing surgery, you'll be navigating hospital labyrinths, solving conditional logic puzzles to access medical supplies, and generally trying to prevent the surgical dummy affectionately known as Bob from dying. Surgeon Simulator 2 features a story mode, playable solo or cooperatively with up to four players, where you're learning on the job using allegedly state-of-the-art simulation technology instead of bothering with stuffy medical school. This takes place over a series of levels, beginning with a tutorial, after which you'll be attempting your first heart transplant--a completely natural progression for medical practitioners, surely.Surgeon Simulator 2's story is communicated through voiceover while you encounter increasingly outlandish situations. What begins as solely performing surgery quickly escalates to uncovering mysteries and conspiracies facing the shady medical facility in which you find yourself. It's all highly ridiculous, but in a way that complements the equally bizarre gameplay.Each level challenges you to not only fix what ails the patient but also to solve various problems en route to providing treatment. This includes passing through inexplicably locked doors that won't open unless a button is pushed or a specific item is placed on a nearby scanner. Usually, an essential item lies behind these locked doors, such as a fresh set of intestines required for a transplant. However, the unlock condition is often placing the patient's old organs on the scanner, resulting in a frantic dash between rooms to replace organs before poor Bob bleeds out. Regardless of how badly you botch an operation, the only fail state is running out of blood. It doesn't matter if you conveniently forget to replace a lung as long as the diagnosed ailment is resolved. You also don't need to bother putting Bob's insides back in anything resembling anatomically correct order--just slap them in and Bob's your uncle (or rather, creepy surgical test dummy). Conversely, heads and limbs must be attached correctly. Surgeon Simulator 2 doesn't provide an explanation for this discrepancy, but making a mess of someone's insides is often incredibly funny.While each level increases in scope and complexity, the controls offer the most consistent challenge. Beyond the standard act of moving in first-person, Surgeon Simulator 2's controls are wildly unconventional. Most notable is the sole arm dangling in your field of vision, which is used to interact with anything you can grab, be it a switch, a tool, or a vital organ. If you're using a keyboard and mouse on PC, holding shift locks your feet in place, allowing you to extend and retract your arm using the mouse. Similarly, clicking in the right-mouse button enables hand rotation, necessary for getting the correct grip angle on objects. Combined with the left-mouse button used for grabbing and releasing, Surgeon Simulator 2 intentionally makes actions taken for granted in typical first-person games incredibly clumsy. Even picking up and using a swipe access card is an awkward flailing mess, let alone successfully completing a double amputation.At first, this baby giraffe level of coordination is hilarious; gleefully tossing vital organs across the room delights for a while. However, as Surgeon Simulator 2’s levels and puzzles ramp up in extravagance, imprecise controls begin to grate. Even when wielding a scalpel, there’s no aiming cursor or highlighted outlines to indicate what you’re about to cut free. Accidentally ripping out the wrong appendage while Bob’s vitals plummet only amuses so many times before frustration sets in.A recurring example of Surgeon Simulator 2’s double-edged clumsiness is prominent whenever limbs are involved. Sure, you can literally grab and yank Bob’s leg off, but taking the time to use a saw results in far less blood loss. Saws and axes cause dotted lines to appear where you can chop away at the unfortunate patient, but it's far too easy to miss these guides and cause more damage than intended. While mimicking the physical act of sawing with your mouse is morbidly amusing, Surgeon Simulator 2's deliberately clumsy control system undermines its skill-based elements. This surgical anarchy would prove to be more amusing--especially in story mode--if the penalty for losing too much blood wasn't restarting the level from scratch. Some later levels are hefty and mazelike in structure, requiring a decent amount of exploration and puzzle-solving. This makes it all the more annoying when you're forced back to the beginning due to the unreliable controls causing a medical mishap of epic proportions.Fortunately, Surgeon Simulator 2 isn't all exasperation. To help prevent disasters, there are two types of syringes: one for stopping bleeding and another for replenishing Bob's blood stores. If you prepare ahead of time by having some injections on hand, everything will usually turn out okay. Most malpractice will only occur when chasing the story mode's extra challenges, such as finishing a level within a strict time limit or keeping blood loss below a set amount.Where Surgeon Simulator 2's obtuse nature works more consistently in its favour is in the community-created content. You can even make your own levels with a comprehensive creation mode, giving you access to all the tools seen in the story mode to enact your own brand of chaos. Oddly, the creation mode tutorial redirects you to a YouTube playlist instead of an interactive guide, which feels a little disjointed. Regardless, playing community-made levels is refreshing, largely due to how the objectives differ from simply healing Bob. You can access community levels by joining a random quickplay queue or searching for specific content to play by yourself or with others. Naturally, the quality of these levels varies, but there are plenty of clever twists on the core surgical gameplay. Some of my favorites included various escape-the-room settings, one of which was an Indiana Jones-themed level replete with giant boulders and Bob in a sarcophagus.Surgeon Simulator 2 likely began its own medical school in protest of being kicked out of the real thing. In creating its own brand of hospital hospitality, there are plenty of laughs to be had. However, hearty chuckles from chucking a heart across a grimy hospital room only last for so long before Surgeon Simulator 2's clumsiness begins to frustrate more than entertain."
4532,Tank Beat,4.0,0,"  Tank Beat isn't much fun. There's very little to it, and what is there is bland, and simplistic. If there's one feat developer MileStone managed to pull off, it's how dull it managed to make the act of blowing up tanks. That might be a fascinating accomplishment, but it makes for an utter bore of a game.         The main mode in Tank Beat is the story mode. Each battle is preceded by an introductory sequence featuring plain anime character drawings engaging in barely cohesive dialogue. The story is a mix of soap opera melodrama and freedom fighter hoo-ha, but it's all just an excuse to stick you in a tank and make you blow stuff to smithereens. To do that, you maneuver your blue dot around on the touch screen by drawing a line from the dot to a destination. You can sweep your viewing/firing arc around your dot by dragging the stylus around in a circle. When you see a red dot, you hold the L button and touch it. If you are a good shot, the red dot blows up. Most of the time, a friendly yellow dot or even a green dot will join you. You can set the companion dot to follow you, guard, seek and destroy, or move along a certain path. Usually you'll just have it follow you around, since micromanaging buddy dots is tedious and unnecessary.      As it turns out, the dots are tanks, judging by the action on the top screen. You will need to glance at the top screen from time to time to judge your line of fire, but even when you do pay attention to it your eyes aren't apt to be pleased. The boxy tanks roam around blurry environments with few topographical features. There may be some defensive walls or a few buildings and whatnot, but the visuals are mostly drab. The bright spot is when you successfully blow up an enemy tank and the camera zooms in to show you the hazy explosion of pixels. The accompanying soundtrack is grating and annoying, as are most of the sound effects.      There is one upside to the sound: Sometimes your combat companion will tell you an enemy is ahead, or off to the right or left. But to whose left is never clear. You might head off to your own left while sweeping your view only to find nothing at all, just in time to notice an enemy rolling in from the right. Another irritation is the simple act of drawing a path. If you draw one, it's indicated with a bright yellow line on the touch screen to let you know where the tank is headed. But occasionally there is a midmission cutscene, and when the scene is over and you are returned to gameplay, the path is gone. So even though your tank will still be following the now-invisible path, you'll need to either use your photographic memory to know where it's headed, or draw a new path. And while some tanks can fire while in motion, others must stop before they can fire. With these tanks, if you stop midpath to fire at an opponent, the path disappears and you need to redraw it. Was it too much to ask to have the tank continue its journey once it fires?     The little campaign takes about three hours to finish, and you can skirmish against the artificial intelligence or up to four other players using the maps and tanks you have unlocked. Tank Beat supports both DS download play and Nintendo Wi-Fi, but it's tough finding even one opponent online, let alone three. But it doesn't matter. Whether you think of Tank Beat as an action title or a strategy title, it's easiest just to call it a game you shouldn't play.     "
4250,NBA ShootOut 2004,4.0,0," Tracy McGrady, shooting guard for the Orlando Magic, was last year's NBA scoring champion and is widely considered to be one of the top five basketball players in the world. Clearly, an athlete of McGrady's caliber deserves better than to be relegated to coverboy for a poor product like 989 Sports' NBA ShootOut 2004. A host of problems can be found in almost all facets of the game, so there simply aren't any good reasons to buy it, especially with better alternatives already available.   The problems begin with the game's graphics. Poor frame rate is the first thing you'll notice when you start a game of ShootOut. Instead of capturing the fluid grace and beauty of professional basketball, the game stutters constantly, especially when the camera shifts viewpoint after a change in possession. The problem is so bad, you'll frequently wonder exactly how a turnover occurred, with your only clue being that the camera has swapped sides. The animations look stilted, and your players often appear to skate and slide over the ground rather than run. There isn't much detail put into any of the arenas, and the crowds are completely flat and unconvincing.      Most disturbingly, players tend to have their heads tilted upward at an unnatural, almost macabre angle. Heads swivel from side to side as players play defense, and, more often than not, the faces on these heads bear little resemblance to the players they're supposed to represent. Even McGrady's face isn't done very well, and he's the cover athlete for ShootOut 2004. You can extrapolate from there how poorly the faces of less marquee players were done. The overall player models aren't much better. Many appear disproportional, and some tattoos on players are included while some are mysteriously omitted.   ShootOut 2004 doesn't do so well in the sound department either. The crowd noise is dull and indistinct, and you hear no chatter at all between players or coaches. The announcing is done by Ian Eagle and the incomparable (some might say ""infamous"") Bill Walton. Unfortunately, it gets repetitive and annoying in a hurry. The duo seems to have very few lines, with Eagle getting overly excited at the most mundane of plays. Walton is his usual self, full of ridiculous comments and metaphors. After about the 100th time you hear him talk about the defense ""parting like the Red Sea,"" you'll wish Walton had never read the story of Moses and the Israelites.   Unfortunately, you won't find any salvation in ShootOut 2004's gameplay. The post game is almost nonexistent. Even if you control a potent post player, like Shaq or Yao Ming, and back your man down to within five or ten feet from the basket, you'll find it almost impossible to hit a jump-hook or fadeaway. In fact, the game makes it difficult to hit any kind of shot, aside from a layup or a dunk. Even if the defender isn't jumping at you or otherwise challenging your jumper, they'll seldom fall unless you are wide open. Good luck getting those open looks, as the computer appears to cheat on its rotations out of the double team. Throw a pass to the open man and you'll see defenders racing to cover the pass recipient, seemingly before the ball leaves the passer's hands.   This isn't to say that it's difficult to score in ShootOut 2004. As a matter of fact, it's embarrassingly easy to get a dunk or layup almost every time down the court. Take control of almost any player, jam on the turbo, and start running back and forth across the lane until you can get your defender caught up on another player. That gives you the opportunity to drive straight to the hole so you can dunk or lay the ball in. If it doesn't work, you can usually go baseline and get to the basket that way, as the computer doesn't seem to understand the importance of sealing that driving lane. Master this method, and your shooting percentage will skyrocket. ShootOut 2004 does include some juke moves mapped to the right analog stick, but the implementation and variety pales in comparison to NBA Live's freestyle or ESPN NBA's isomotion. Besides, who needs to use juke moves when you can get cheesy dunks by just running back and forth across the lane until your defender gets lost?   Ratcheting up the difficulty level doesn't help matters much either. At Hall of Fame difficulty the computer simply sends a constant double or triple team at the ballhandler and cranks up the shot blocking to the point where any and every contested shot of yours gets swatted. You can still score using the cheese-method, but it's just a little more difficult to shake two or three defenders instead of just one.      Defense isn't much more rewarding than playing offense. It's very easy to rack up a ton of steals in the game simply by running up to the ballhandler and pounding on the steal button. You won't get whistled for fouls very often, and you'll frequently knock the ball away for an easy turnover. For the times you do give up a shot, you'll find that it's also rather easy to block them. Rebounding is hit or miss. Sometimes it seems as though you have good control over the players in the low block, while jumping for the boards, but at other times it seems like the ball will simply clip through your players and find its way into the hands of the computer.    Strange bugs plague the gameplay as well. Play long enough and you'll see the computer exhibit some bizarre behavior, like throwing the ball out of bounds off of an inbound pass play or passing to a teammate behind the half-court line for an over-and-back turnover. Sometimes you'll hear the announcer say the wrong name on a play. You'll also see the slow-motion highlight camera engage even though your player was actually stripped of the ball as he went up for a dunk. Perhaps most frustrating is that the camera will often focus for a couple of seconds on the computer players running back to play defense after they've made a basket. You can't skip that bit of animation, making it impossible to try to fast-break after a made basket.      While you can play single exhibition games or one full season, unlike other basketball games on the market, ShootOut 2004 doesn't include a traditional franchise mode where you take the role of a general manager of a team. Instead, the game's career mode focuses on your created character as he tries to make his way up from the ranks of the summer leagues and the NBDL to ""the big show"" in the NBA. Every game you play while in the summer league or NBDL includes a list of goals, such as scoring a certain number of points, getting a steal or a block, and/or holding one of the opposing players under a certain number of points. If you consistently achieve most of your goals, an NBA team will offer you a contract, and you can attempt to prove yourself at that level. If you are good enough to stick around the NBA and win a few championships, scoring titles, and other accolades, you can eventually earn enough points to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.   While ShootOut 2004's career mode is an interesting idea, its implementation leaves a lot to be desired. First of all, the game doesn't give a clear enough idea of how to improve your attributes like speed, ballhandling, shooting ability, etc. This seems like a strange omission, given that the whole idea of career mode is to improve your character enough to get a spot in the NBA. Also, the computer seems to have no regard at all for the existing players in the NBA when you're given your chance. To exemplify this point, one of our created characters, a shooting guard who tried out for the Lakers, immediately replaced Kobe Bryant in the starting lineup after being offered a contract! Needless to say, this idea is preposterous. Finally, it's a little odd that the game includes all the real NBDL teams, but it doesn't include any real-life players who actually do play in the ""D-League."" The NBDL rosters in ShootOut 2004 are, interestingly, comprised of fictional players.   The game does include a couple of other features, like the inclusion of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players and voice activated commands. Each of the 50 greatest players are unlocked by accomplishing certain challenges in the exhibition games, like scoring a certain number of points and assists using the point guard of a certain team or racking up the most points and rebounds in a game with the center of another team. The voice commands are another feature that allows players with USB headsets to issue specific plays on offense or defense. While the feature seems to work reasonably well, ShootOut 2004's core gameplay mechanics aren't solid enough to necessitate or benefit much from such a gimmick. You'll find yourself falling back on the cheesy game exploits more often than not.   The online aspect of ShootOut 2004 is surprisingly feature-rich, with working leaderboards, message boards, polls, news, and tournaments. The gameplay is also pretty smooth, in general, with few latency or lag issues. It's just too bad such a nice network infrastructure is wasted on a game that plays as poorly as ShootOut.      At one point in time, 989 Sports was a leading contender among sports game developers, but in recent years they've clearly been overtaken. With a myriad of problems across the board, NBA ShootOut 2004 brings 989 Sports no closer to its competitors. Unless you're a basketball nut who must own a copy of every single basketball game on the market, or you're one of the world's few NBDL fans, there are much better alternatives than NBA ShootOut 2004.   "
1979,Mario Golf: World Tour,7.0,2,"      It helps that there's lots to do too. There are versus options, numerous tournaments, and a series of challenges, some of which test your skill while others focus heavily on the use of power-ups. Sending your ball floating through the air over longer distances, or skimming across a handily placed speed pads feel great, at least once you've figured out what you're supposed to be doing with them. Challenges that incorporate them include completing a series of holes while hitting the ball through oversized rings, smacking moles out the ground, using a random selection of clubs, or competing against one of the 12 AI characters to unlock his or her Star Player equivalent (a more powerful but trickier to control version of the basic character).   Editor's Note:   "
2817,Infinity Blade II,9.0,2,"   Punch-Out!! rather than the likes of Diablo or Dark Souls. Your opponents have a very specific set of moves they perform, such as sword strikes, kicks and punches, or magic spells. Anticipating those moves to block, dodge, or parry them is the only way to succeed.     Thankfully, your opponents have a number of tells that aid you in identifying their next attack. Sword swipes might be preceded by a long swing, while long run-ups usher in punches and kicks. If you're faced with a sword attack, your best option is to parry it by swiping in the direction of your opponent's swing. Kicks and punches are best avoided with dodges by pushing to the left or right of the screen, while blocks work as a last resort when you have failed to anticipate a move and need to defend a follow-up combo. Successfully defend yourself, and you can unleash an attack of your own, swiping at the screen to perform different types of strikes. By swiping smoothly back and forth you perform combos, which deal more damage. Or, if you're on the ropes, you can perform a magic attack that can't be blocked by replicating a specific swipe pattern, depending on the spell.     It's an elegantly designed system that works extremely well, with the direction of your swipes accurately replicated by Siris. Each enemy has unique moves, ensuring there's variety to the combat. Plus, battles are just the right length for a quick fix while you're on the move, letting you chip away at the game in smaller chunks. For each opponent you defeat you're rewarded with experience points, with bonus XP on offer for performing different challenges such as executing 10 combos in a row, or dodging five attacks. That XP is used to level up Siris, so you allocate points to your attack, defence, shield, or health to increase his effectiveness in battle. You also earn money, which you can use to buy stronger weapons and armour.       Different weapon types affect your abilities, so if you buy a heavy weapon such as an axe, you lose your shield and dodging ability, replaced instead by buttons that let you block with your weapon. Choose to dual-wield, and you become much more nimble, but you lose the ability to block entirely. You can also place gems you earn from battles within your weapons for extra bonuses, such as increasing the amount of gold you earn or the number of gems that are dropped by enemies. These RPG elements give the game depth, making battles all the more compelling.     They also go hand in hand with the game's structure. While you might manage to make your way to the top of the tower to battle the God King early on, his high level ensures that you're unlikely to defeat him on your first encounter. Your experience points and items remain intact, however, so you can work through the tower again, gaining new items and levelling up until you're finally ready to take him down. Each time you do so, the enemies change, so you're never faced with the exact same adventure twice. Not only that, but reaching higher levels unlocks different paths to the God King, with all-new areas to explore. There are also keys to find scattered throughout the tower that let you unlock new paths, or chests that contain upgrades and money.      Even when you defeat the God King, the battle system is so fun that you're still compelled to jump in and take down the many enemies that litter the tower. There's also Game Centre support, so you can share your high scores with friends, as well as unlock achievements. Infinity Blade II doesn't just nail the gameplay either--it's a beautiful-looking game. Breathtaking environments such as a Japanese temple surrounded by pink blossoms and the huge monolithic tower set amid mountains are stunning. The characters themselves are also striking. The bulging muscles, evil eyes, and ornate armour of your opponents have a detailed steampunk style that's a treat for the eyes, along with the sparks and streaks of light that accompany your attacks.       Infinity Blade II is a real showcase for iOS, bringing a full gaming experience to the platform that isn't simply a shoehorning of existing ideas onto a touch screen. It has an identity of its own, successfully straddling RPG depth with an experience that can be sampled in small chunks in a way that few other iOS games can match. Plus, like the first game, it should be heavily supported postrelease, with new bosses, environments, and rewards promised for future updates, all for free. Infinity Blade II sets the standard for big experiences on the go, and is an essential purchase for any iOS-toting gamer.  "
2544,Transcripted,8.0,2,"Geometry Wars and tile matchers like Zuma, but in a marketplace where developers are mashing together genres like George Mendel blending plant species, it shines as one of the finer efforts. It manages to feel at once like dozens of other games but like nothing you've ever played before, and it's a rewarding experience that's well worth its humble price tag.        As if the odd mixture of Zuma and dual-stick shooters weren't fascinating enough, the storyline also pushes the limits of what's expected. Similar puzzlers usually satisfy the need for context with a vague string of sentences describing plot details; Transcripted bulges with around half an hour's worth of competently voiced dialogue between a nasty pharmaceutical businessman with an English accent, a sleep-deprived programmer named Adam who steers the probe you control, and a female AI named NADIA.      The story is simple fluff that nevertheless achieves a certain charm at times, such as when NADIA and Adam swap quips with all the flirtatiousness of Mass Effect's Joker and EDI, but it also eases Transcripted into a fairly manageable learning curve over its 25 levels. In the early tutorial stages, the idea is that you're just blasting apart strands of malignant DNA in the lab, but as the story veers toward concerns of bioterrorism and alien interference, it introduces killer lasers and pathogens that fire plasma cannons in a way that fits well with the urgency of the storyline. Maintaining the biomedical setting requires an increasingly forced suspension of disbelief with all these lasers going off, but Transcripted handles it well for a game that would have been fine without a story.      That's mostly because it meshes the ideas behind the two genres so well that jumping into the first levels of gameplay without a tutorial requires only that you imagine yourself playing both on the same screen. In each match, you control a probe that fires projectiles at floating pathogens much as you'd fire lasers at space rubble in Asteroids, and you pick up the colored cubes these enemies sometimes drop with the aim of firing them at three or more cubes in the moving pseudo-DNA strands that surround you. It doesn't take long for this formula to get intense (especially when you consider that both Geometry Wars and Zuma get intense enough on their own), which makes the option to independently adjust the difficulty of the shooting and the tile-matching a welcome one. If you're a master of the tile-matching portion but less adept at the shooter aspect, for instance, you can crank the puzzle setting to hard and nudge the shooter portion to easy. Such options are especially useful in the enjoyable boss fights, which hinge on clever uses of the strategies you learn in prior levels.         Transcripted's design makes bold strides toward easing you into its learning curve; for instance, it grants breathing room for shots by temporarily registering the probe as one of the pathogens while it's carrying the globs at the expense of slowed movement. This allows enemy projectiles to bounce off your shield, and cloaks you from enemy pathogens. Elsewhere, upgrades abound, allowing you to install better weapons to blast through enemies more quickly or boost your probe's health and speed if you're dying too much.      The upgrade system inspires replay and bestows a clear sense of progression and improvement, particularly since you can get more credits to spend on the upgrades only if you beat your score from a previous attempt. This detail alleviates concerns of simply replaying easier levels to snag better gear. Further replay value arises from the five challenge rooms, which limit the probe's upgrades and include worldwide leaderboards.      It's a credit to Transcripted's design that you never lose sight of what's going on, thanks to a smart use of color, even in the later stages when the screen is packed with flying projectiles, increasingly complex DNA strands, and enemy pathogens. It's also a visually striking game, with a limited but arresting assortment of backgrounds that mimic the wonders seen through electron microscopes. The visuals are complemented by a softly pulsing soundtrack that suits the biological setting and manages to walk a delicate line between soothing and intense. The combination is such that Transcripted is relaxing once you've mastered its idiosyncrasies, even in the frantic final levels when you're shaking off toxins and attempting to stave off pathogens from specific zones across the map.         Yet for all its strengths, Transcripted isn't without its issues. Its unique hybridization works best when it's playing it safe by simply mashing the two genres together, but it falters when it attempts to introduce gameplay elements of its own. These weaknesses are most apparent in escort missions, which subvert the matching genre by asking you to prevent enemy pathogens from making matches on DNA strands by tossing in white blocks that disrupt the chains. These missions always feel awkward even with the best upgrades, especially since the need to fight at the same time disrupts the extreme concentration and precision required. Elsewhere, the settings screen indicates that you can play Transcripted with an Xbox 360 controller, but plugging one might only activate the hint screen when you press the Y button. Some players have discovered workarounds, but these troubles are a shame, since a controller is better suited to the game than a keyboard and mouse.      But such drawbacks shouldn't dissuade you from giving Transcripted a chance if you like Zuma or Geometry Wars. It's one of the most satisfying twin-stick shooters since the latter made its appearance, and it's another fine example of how new separate genres can feel when you combine them. It's more than challenging enough for veterans of either genre, yet it usually feels fair enough to welcome newcomers, and it evolves with excellent pacing that could appeal to almost anyone.     "
3659,NASCAR Thunder 2003,5.0,1,"EA Sports' NASCAR Thunder series recently received its annual update on the three main console platforms, and the 2003 edition of the popular stock car racing simulation featured a number of enhancements on and additions to the previous version. For the first time, EA Sports is also bringing NASCAR Thunder to the PC this year. Since the game was all but identical on the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox, you might assume that the PC version would simply be another retread. Strangely, this isn't the case. The PC version of NASCAR Thunder 2003 is seriously stripped down compared with its console cousins, and it doesn't have enough PC-specific features to make up for what boils down to a sparse and unentertaining racing experience.   The NASCAR Thunder series has always leaned more toward simulation racing than arcade-style action, and the PC version of 2003 upholds this tradition. The gameplay isn't geared toward simply hitting the gas and flying wildly around the track. Instead, you need to pay careful attention to acceleration and braking as you take the turns of each of the game's 24 Winston Cup tracks. Your racing experience in NASCAR Thunder 2003 is affected by a vast number of factors--every part of your car can be tweaked to affect handling and performance on the racetrack. The customization options are perhaps a bit overabundant, and only the most serious gearheads will be able to fully exploit them to seriously improve their car. Most players will probably opt to accept the defaults and get on with the race. The actual control in the game is fairly responsive with a gamepad, but unless you have analog control, you'll find yourself tapping your car back and forth into position, which will often cause you to spin out or bump other cars if you overcompensate for a bad turn. As with just about any racing game on the PC, a steering wheel is the optimal control solution, but a run-of-the-mill gamepad will generally be sufficient.   When you start up NASCAR Thunder 2003, you're greeted with a brief menu that displays your racing options: quick race, testing, season, and multiplayer. Quick race is exactly what it sounds like--you pick a driver and car, choose a track, qualify for a starting position, and then run the race. Testing lets you pair any car and track to simply run around the loop for as long as you want to help you try to improve your finishing times. The real core of the game is in the season mode, in which you must qualify for and then run an entire season of Winston Cup races, accumulating points and vying for the championship. Unfortunately, there's really not a whole lot in the season mode that you don't get already with a quick race. The qualifying and racing are more or less identical. The season mode simply strings a lot of races together in sequence and keeps track of your standing throughout. Finally, the multiplayer mode lets you race against other players on the Internet or on a LAN. But with a limit of just 16 players, you won't be able to approach the number of competitors in a real NASCAR race. The multiplayer mode is also a bit strange because it lets you join a race that's already in progress, which rather defeats the purpose of racing to begin with.   Perhaps the most confusing aspect of NASCAR Thunder 2003 on the PC is the fact it has so few features and game modes when compared with the console versions. Those games have a much richer list of game modes and side options, such as a career mode that lets you manage your driver's sponsorship, race team, and races over 20 seasons; tutorials on each track led by actual NASCAR drivers; playable racing scenarios from Winston Cup history; and an accessible create-a-car interface. It seems that these options wouldn't have been hard to include in the PC version of the game, but they're not here, leaving PC gamers with little to fill in the gaps besides a lackluster multiplayer mode. The console versions' extra features would really have been a nice addition to flesh out what is otherwise a pretty empty game.   The graphics and sounds in NASCAR Thunder 2003 are also a letdown compared with those of the console versions. Graphically, the game produces mixed results. The cars are nicely detailed and textured, but the track and surrounding environment graphics are incredibly bland and flat by comparison. Fortunately, this keeps the game's frame rate fairly consistent, even when there are 40 or more drivers racing around the track at once, though if you have a fancy 3D graphics card, NASCAR Thunder 2003 definitely won't give it a workout. The game also doesn't compare to its console brethren in the sound department, since the voice samples are much fewer in number and of lower quality here. Just about all you'll hear during a race is the roar of the engines, because the sparse radio chatter of your team tends to get drowned out.   NASCAR Thunder 2003 on the PC lacks most of the features and polish of its console counterparts. This is EA Sports' first attempt at bringing its NASCAR franchise to the PC, so you might expect a few minor bumps in the road, so to speak. Unfortunately, the game is a pale shadow of what is available for the current consoles, so if you also own even one of the three consoles, you'd be much better off getting the console version. If all you have is a PC, your choices are more limited, but unless you're absolutely desperate for a NASCAR game to play on your PC and you've already played through Sierra's far superior NASCAR Racing Season 2002, you may be better off waiting until next year."
165,Cursed to Golf,9.0,2,"I'm standing on the tee of a familiar hole. A booming drive will fly over ponds, bunkers, and spikes before colliding with a golden idol to add four shots to par. But now that I have a variety of Ace Cards, I can follow a wildly different path. There's a column of TNT directly behind me that I blow up with a card before equipping another one that lets me change the direction of the shot in mid-air. I take out my wedge and pitch the ball into the newly created opening behind me. Before it drops into the water below, I redirect the ball through a narrow passage and into a small nook filled with spikes and a handy ricochet bumper. Then, I fling it backwards at the bumper, which allows me to redirect the ball for a third time. The ball soars through the small opening, bounces twice on the island green, and falls into the cup with the help of a bit of spin I added. A hole-in-one--my first in Cursed to Golf. The first two times I played this hole, it took me around five minutes and more than a dozen shots.The magic of Cursed to Golf comes from the moments when you figure out entirely new ways to finish levels more efficiently and in mechanically interesting ways. Even though Cursed to Golf allows you to send your golf ball through portals, turn it into ice and thunder, or even transform it into a rocket, it captures the beauty of actual golf in a way that very few golf games have in the past--even ""realistic"" ones. Like real golf, each and every shot feels different, and, most importantly, the only limitation you have is your creativity and ingenuity. The freedom you're given to experiment throughout each level makes subsequent runs through the very same layout feel entirely fresh.During the final round of a tournament, you're killed by a lightning strike and sent to Golf Purgatory, an underworld with a diabolical golf course operated by the Greenskeeper. To escape, you have to finish all of the 18 side-scrolling holes in a row without running out of shots. A roguelike structure sends you back to the beginning of the course if you fail during any of the levels. Gameplay is the focus here, but Cursed to Golf has witty dialogue, a rather heartwarming story, and a lighthearted tone despite the fact you're essentially trapped in hell.On the surface, Cursed to Golf has simplistic gameplay mechanics. It uses a click-based swing system. You set your power using a meter and your aim by pressing the button again. Critically, aiming isn't manual. The direction of your shot corresponds to your click timing. A shot preview shows you the path the ball will take, so you always know where it's headed. Your bag consists of a driver, iron, and wedge.On a shot by shot basis, Cursed to Golf is a lot of fun, even when you're not using Ace Cards, the power-ups and perks you collect throughout each run that can modify shots. Rapidly pressing a button in the air and then pointing the D-pad or stick in the desired direction creates spin on the ball when it lands. Due to the sheer chaos of the levels, spin is monumentally important. The ball physics are stellar. In some ways, Cursed to Golf resembles precision platformers thanks to its tight controls that provide depth and reward mastery.Ace Cards turn levels into clever puzzles to be cracked. Cursed to Golf has more than 20 different Ace Cards. Some of the cards provide basic perks, such as taking a mulligan (repeating the previous shot), adding strokes to your par count, or taking a practice shot. Most of them, however, affect the golf ball and its flight.You can turn the golf ball into a drill to dig through walls, coat it with ice to freeze ponds, electrify it to destroy vines that otherwise eat the ball and give you a one-stroke penalty, and redirect the shot with the U-Turn card to get a hole-in-one (hopefully). Multiple different rocketballs give you free control over your shot in the air, some of which go faster and farther and others that are better at cutting corners. Scattershot lets you press a button in mid-air to break the ball into three, and lets you pick which one to play afterward. You can stop the ball in mid-air so it drops immediately, as well as make it act like a lead weight to stop it from rolling when it touches down. One Ace Card turns the ball into a matterless object, so it can pass through walls and other obstacles. Meanwhile, you can set up portals, which yes, work just about the same as they do in that Portal.The sheer variety of Ace Cards give you many, many different ways to approach each shot, and make some of the game's more daunting levels more approachable. I found myself experimenting with different cards on a regular basis, learning new methods for lowering my scores even after putting more than 20 hours into the game. You start each run with a small assortment of Ace Cards, but as you progress through the increasingly challenging levels, your deck expands and so do the possibilities.In Cursed to Golf, your main currency is cash, which is earned based on how many remaining shots you have left at the end of each level. You can then spend cash on Ace Card packs and single cards in the shops you come across throughout each run. You can also find money and Ace Cards in chests while driving your cart between holes in the overworld. The setup is similar to other roguelikes such as Slay the Spire, with forks in the road that give you a choice of which direction to take.Cursed to Golf's level design reminded me a lot of Spelunky in that it has verticality to it as well as many small ledges and sections throughout each level that feel like little self-contained challenges. Split up into four biomes--grassy, desert, cavern, and fiery hell--the 18-hole course throws a dizzying barrage of obstacles and designs at you. While it is a roguelike, the sprawling levels are not randomly generated. The Greenskeeper ""shifts"" the course around, putting levels in different spots, and introducing levels you haven't played during your next run. Chuhai Labs says there are more than 70 possible levels. In the 12 runs it took me to beat all 18 levels, I probably saw around 40-50 different course layouts.Even though there isn't an ""endless"" supply of levels, each level has numerous paths to take. Some of the later levels are so large that you'd probably have to play them at least 10 times to see every area. Many levels also have multiple flagsticks, so you can beat it by reaching either one. Each of the biomes introduces new obstacles. The grassy zone mostly has spikes, water, and bunkers to stand in your way. The desert biome adds giant mounds of sand, more elaborate spikes, the aforementioned bumpers to essentially play pinball, moving platforms, and tunnel systems to transport your ball. The cavern levels trade the huge bunkers for those vines that eat your golf ball. All of these biomes have teleporters and in hard-to-reach spots that can help you skip part of the level, and there are wind turbines that can guide your ball through labyrinthine corridors.Cursed to Golf balances risk and reward extremely well with its varied level design. The hazards are deftly placed to make you really stop and think about which Ace Card to use and which route to take. Seeing as many hazards also inflict a one-stroke penalty, avoidance is important. You only start each hole with five total shots, but you can add to that count by breaking idols throughout each hole and using Ace Cards. The ""risk"" is always due to the difficulty of the shot you're attempting; even when using wacky Ace Cards, you're not leaving the end result to chance. A well-executed shot always works, which makes Cursed to Golf rigorously fair, despite its silliness.The first time I played one of the cavern levels, it took me more than 30 shots due to playing it safe and taking the clearest route. The next time I played that hole, I beat it in five shots thanks to Ace Cards and an appetite for risk. It's an impressive feat in level design that both of those outcomes felt rewarding in their own ways. Late-game levels have such tricky structures that you could reasonably use an Ace Card on every shot and it wouldn't feel like a waste.The risk-reward extends to your choice of which path to take. There are ""Cursed"" versions of levels that are tougher but reward you with a pack of Ace Cards and are often located on a path alongside treasure chests and shops. Cursed levels inflict you or the course with a detrimental quirk every few shots. Idols are removed from the course, your deck is locked, turbulent wind/rain is present, your driver isn't playable, etc. There's even a pesky curse that flips the screen upside and another that only lets you hit the ball right or left. Cursed levels also have mucky little gravesites that penalize you one shot. The risk of dying on a Cursed course is certainly higher than regular layouts, but the rewards are incredibly useful for the long haul. This is where you're rewarded for smart use of Ace Cards and precise shots.It's not just the Cursed levels that make the roguelike progression system really hum. I love how Cursed to Golf implements roguelike features in an encouraging way. At first, you may only make it through a few holes before dying, but once you start to understand the rules, the levels become daunting but doable. You lose all of the Ace Cards you earned during the run and your cash when you die. Considering that later levels often demand the use of Ace Cards, Cursed to Golf would likely be a pretty frustrating experience if it didn't implement a few progression system features after defeating bosses.Throughout your run, you face off against a trio of bosses, each of which you have to beat to the flag in order to move on. All three of the bosses have their own unique quirks and personalities that make them interesting and fun to play against. The large armor-clad Scotsman hits ridiculously long drives. The Explorer changes sections of the course throughout the hole to try to trip you up. And The Forgotten gets the assistance of a couple of birds--Birdie and Albatross (golf names!)--who cheat and carry the ball through tough areas of the level. Once you beat a boss, you don't have to face them again in subsequent runs. This compelled me to go all out with my Ace Cards to win--even if it meant not having many left for the ensuing levels.Your rewards for conquering these formidable foes are immense and make Cursed to Golf one of least stressful--yet still challenging--roguelikes I've played. The first ability you get is a checkpoint flag, which lets you save your progress after a completed hole once per round. If you die, you'll still lose your gear, but you won't have to start at the beginning (unless you die again). The Gimmie ability raises your par count back to five after your final stroke one time per hole, effectively giving you 10 shots by default. The final, and ultimately most useful, perk allows you to return to the checkpoint flag (or beginning) with all of your Ace Cards after death once per round. These abilities combined with storing some of your cards in a binder to grab during future runs go a long way toward letting you experience the totality of the game in a way that highlights all of its best features--Ace Cards, all four unique biomes, and the many different levels.My first completed run took 2.5 hours--the game saves after each level and logs your stats for each run--and I spent 15 hours total to get there. During my second completed run, I aimed for the lowest score possible, and I found a pretty fun way to do it. I played through the first 15 holes while only using a couple of Ace Cards. Then I purposely died to go back to the beginning with all my cards. I was able to use cards on almost every shot and never ran out. I even finished that run with more than 100 cards left. So if you're worried about Cursed to Golf's difficulty or you're averse to roguelikes, you can game the system without too much stress.Cursed to Golf is an absolute joy to play, but it's also lovely to look at and listen to. The colorful character sprites and environmental designs have a Game Boy Advance vibe to them that's utterly charming. The electronic soundtrack, composed by Mark Sparling (A Short Hike), is upbeat, catchy, and complements the visuals to make a welcoming atmosphere you want to spend time in.Every aspect of Cursed to Golf comes together to form a truly special and unique game. With its simple hook, brilliantly designed levels, huge suite of dynamic abilities, and a finely balanced roguelike structure, Cursed to Golf is a constant delight. There have been many great games released in 2022 so far, but Cursed to Golf is easily at the top of my list at this moment. It's one of the best golf games ever made, but you don't have to like golf to enjoy the curse of being forced to play it."
3936,Haunted Mansion: Fear of the Dark,5.0,1," Although the top-down viewpoint might confuse some, Disney's The Haunted Mansion is essentially a rather unusual take on the shooter genre--and not a very good one, at that.    A flashlight is your sidearm in Haunted Mansion. To dispatch ghoulies, you need only point your light in the direction of the baddie. The primary challenge is enduring the game's jerky control. Occasionally, a power-up will fall from some apparition's phantasmal stash. Sometimes it's a battery to recharge your flashlight. Sometimes it's a flashlight attachment that alters the size of your light stream. Very rarely, it's a special power-up that encircles your character in light for a limited time.    The mansion is broken up into wings, each of which contains several rooms. The goal in each room is to put the fear of God into a few specters, then flip on a light switch. Once you ""let there be light,"" you can advance to the next room. As you progress, light switches may be farther from doorways. If you take to long meandering to the egress, you'll have to regress and flip the switch again, because they only stay in the ""on"" position for a limited time. One going theory is that the ghosts toggle the lights back on. Another theory is that Walt Disney Interactive can't design its way out of a paper bag--or a mansion, for that matter.   All but the most naive gamers will recognize The Haunted Mansion for what it is--a cleverly repackaged shooter. Judged accordingly; Mansion's a mediocre effort at best.  "
4610,Smashing Drive,4.0,0,"Smashing Drive is Namco's arcade-to-home translation of a simplistic game that casts you as a cabbie trying to score big bucks in bustling New York City. What makes Smashing Drive superficially different from being just another Crazy Taxi clone is your checker cab's ability to pick up a variety of useful power-ups. Actually, Smashing Drive plays more like a standard racing game than like Crazy Taxi, as you don't pick up fares--you will instead be challenged to race through checkpoints in an effort to improve your time, add seconds to your ticking clock, and top the best overall score. By no means the most technically impressive GameCube game, Smashing Drive would hold the interest of only the most dedicated arcade racing fans. Smashing Drive includes three main modes of play: arcade, survival, and two-player. The arcade mode is the standard game in which you race against a computer-controlled cabbie, in three different levels and their three subroutes, picking up such items as the turbo boost, 4x4 tires, glider wings, and the crash bumper. There are three shifts to play through, corresponding with the easy, medium, and hard difficulties. Playing through each of the shifts and finding all of the shortcuts is relatively simple if you have any experience with racing games, and it is eased greatly by the game's infinite continues. Beating all three of the standard courses can be done in about an hour, which unlocks the final bonus stage, adding up to an extremely short-lived single-player experience. You can then attempt the survival mode, which is identical to the arcade mode except for the fact that car damage will end your current run instead of simply leaving you as a limping wreck. The head-to-head mode lets you and a friend challenge each other, which can be slightly more entertaining than facing the computer-controlled cabbie if you can find a friend patient enough to play. At any rate, the game doesn't seem very well designed for two-player, as there is generally a best route to take, and the lead player will usually end up nabbing all of the power-ups. All things considered, Smashing Drive offers at the most a single afternoon's worth of entertainment before most players will feel as though it has overstayed its welcome. Smashing Drive's visuals, which use blocky car models and pedestrian models, are none too impressive. While there's a lot of variety to the brief levels, there's not much here that draws you visually--everything seems flat and hollow. However, you'll be able to find many hidden risky routes or shortcuts. You can race straight up the side of buildings, race across the top of passenger jets on an airstrip, and even fly off ramps over passing ferryboats. While none of these look very good, finding them and watching the mayhem as it unfolds can be satisfying the first time through. On the other hand, knocking cars about as you race through busy streets is all too simple--you almost plow right through them--and this calls undue attention to the simplicity of the game engine itself. It's possible to blow up vehicles that are in your way, but amidst the destruction, the game uses a distracting effect that shakes and blurs your view both at the same time. Smashing Drive's graphics may be substandard, but they do their job and let you properly locate and explore the ins and outs of each of the game's creatively conceived shortcuts. Also, Smashing Drive does run at a smooth steady frame rate, even during the head-to-head mode. The graphics aren't half as bad as the game's audio. Generic crash effects and explosion effects accompany the many acts of vehicular violence, which are the least noteworthy of the game's audible traits. One of the most-often-used power-ups, the sonic horn weapon, encourages you to blare an extremely aggravating horn that blasts everything out of your way, with a blaring sound that would seem out of place even in a game about 18-wheelers. But the worst culprit is the game's music, which is just as disappointing as the game's short life span. There are three grungy garage rock songs in total, and all three are of absolutely abysmal production value. A single song loops every 30 seconds or so for each level--listening to the same horrible song over and over again for 20 minutes will practically be enough to drive you mad. Perhaps the best thing to be said for Smashing Drive is that its often-used formula is still somewhat entertaining today. Games such as Crazy Taxi and the Rush series have shown that driving games need not necessarily be about simply racing around a track, and Smashing Drive, with its wacky courses, still makes a decent arcade game. However, its extremely short life span, accompanied by its lukewarm presentation, ensures that few players will get more than a couple of hours' worth of enjoyment out of the home version. Given that, it's impossible to recommend purchasing the game."
4294,Top Gear: Dare Devil,4.0,0,"With the popularity of Crazy Taxi, it's rather surprising that it's taken this long for another company to attempt to emulate that game's winning formula. Kemco, a longtime Nintendo developer, makes the jump to the PS2 with Top Gear Dare Devil, a game whose purpose, it would seem, is to duplicate the hurried arcade feel of Crazy Taxi. Unfortunately, Top Gear Dare Devil is so rife with problems, it not only fails to capture the magic of Crazy Taxi, but it also has a hard time being an enjoyable game in and of itself.   Top Gear Dare Devil takes place across the globe, with large maps designed after the city streets of Rome, London, Tokyo, and San Francisco. At first you are only given access to one car, but as you complete missions, more cars are revealed. Your missions invariably involve you driving around, picking up the coins that are scattered about the city, and returning to a finish point, which is oddly represented by an eerie green mist, before your time runs out. With only 60 seconds to grab upward of 15 coins, you'll be depending on the nitro and time extension power-ups, which are also scattered across the city. The gameplay never deviates from this formula, and with the only variables being the start and finish points and the placement of the coins and power-ups, the game quickly loses any novelty it may have had and becomes an exercise in tedium. While the game attempts to imitate the frantic action of Crazy Taxi, the nitro and time extension power-ups are too liberally dispersed, making it easy to just rack up a surplus of time, which effectively slows down the tempo of the whole game.    The pacing is also crippled by the game's Bizarro World physics engine. Most objects seen on the street can be run into for ""crash"" points. This includes, but is not limited to, crates, parking meters, traffic lights, stop signs, corner stores, and, of course, other automobiles. The problem is the physics engine's inconsistencies, as some objects, like street lights, won't budge, which seems ludicrous after you've just plowed through three double-decker buses without losing a step. The different cars, which include licenseless Volkswagen Beetle and Morris Mini lookalikes, all have a propensity for spinning wildly out of control when confronted with irregularities in the road. Since none of the cars have a decent turning radius, you'd think that powersliding would be the order of the day, but you'll quickly find that the powerslide function is nearly useless. When attempting to powerslide, you'll instead slide sideways until you hit a wall or something else that is indestructible, never gaining the slightest bit of forward traction.    Top Gear Dare Devil fares better with the graphics, but they're not without their flaws. Each city map is quite large, with lots of attention to detail. You can easily differentiate between the different cities, and each map fairly represents its respective metropolis. The different automobiles you'll drive and encounter on the road look good enough that you can tell the real-world make and model of the cars. There are some minor gripes over style choices, like the excessive amount of reflective bling that comes off your car, but the real graphical problem with Top Gear Dare Devil is the seemingly random slow down that plagues the game. The game's sound is good, with a pleasant mix of house, hip-hop, and pop music providing a background for the tire-screeching and car-crashing sound effects. There's good attention to detail in the sound department, with nuances like slight irregularities in your idling engine giving the game's soundscape some polish.   It's unfortunate that the rest of the game lacks said polish. There is a good deal of potential here, but Top Gear Dare Devil's deeply flawed physics engine, lack of gameplay variations, and frame rate issues keep it in the shadow of Crazy Taxi and make it a game that you should avoid."
1353,Party Hard,7.0,2,"The premise for Party Hard is disturbing. You play as a psychopath, Darius, who goes on a nationwide killing spree just because he can’t get any sleep. Darius seeks out the biggest parties around the United States, repeatedly stabbing and beheading people left and right. But developer tinyBuild sprinkles much-needed levity and dark humor throughout--Party Hard, thankfully, doesn’t take its premise seriously.Party Hard plays from a top-down perspective, and is separated into several types of parties. Each level consists of five or six different areas, from kitchens and bedrooms, to private VIP balconies and dance floors. Your objective is always the same--kill everyone at these parties without getting caught by the police. Beyond taking out partygoers with your knife, there are several different ways of getting the job done: you can also set off traps, and have other people kill for you.Setting rooms on fire, poisoning people’s drinks and food, and rigging dance floors with bombs are a few colorful options. During one level inside a famous Los Angeles nightclub, I was able to summon a UFO. A few aliens started abducting people for me while I hid backstage. In another level, on a boat party in Miami, I dispatched a smoke bomb, which allowed me to quickly stab a group of people while remaining hidden. Party Hard is slowly paced, requiring you to constantly strategize and analyze your surroundings. Rushing in, and killing people without any thought and care put into your attacks will likely get you caught.This slow nature reflects Darius' disturbingly dispassionate nature. He wants to enjoy every one of his murders and leave the crime scene without any trace. It's challenging and enjoyable to plan your kills, and make full use of your environments. Party Hard is like a deadly game of cat and mouse, always testing your ability to adapt and observe. Should I carry this drunk person to a hidden bush? Should I set the kitchen on fire now, or wait for more people to come in? Will I able to kill all four of these stragglers before someone spots me and calls the police?The levels are well designed and visually distinct, giving you enough room to breathe while also making it difficult to slip away unnoticed. The LA night club level, for example, has a pair of hidden stairs that allow you to swiftly move from the kitchen, all the way to an abandoned alley on the other side in mere seconds. But be wary of an eccentric man dressed as Mario at this nightclub, because he'll demolish the stairs if you use them too much.But for everything Party Hard gets right mechanically, it suffers from being repetitive. It's a shallow affair. While the first few levels are engaging, they introduce everything Party Hard has to offer. In every level there are always the same traps and items you can utilize, and the overreliance on your knife grows monotonous. I spent a lot of time waiting for people to fall asleep, or for them to move to an isolated area. When cops give chase, they can easily be exploited by employing basic tactics. I quickly found out that circling large fences, pools, and stages confuses the AI, forcing the cops to give up after a few seconds.Party Hard employs a beautiful neo-noir, pixel-art aesthetic and ‘80s soundtrack. It's similar to Hotline Miami, with heavy doses of purple and pink. The parties are frenetic spectacles replete with neon lights, eccentric character designs (the aliens look pleasingly weird), and plenty of blood and gore. The pixel-art visuals are another source of levity, as everything looks a bit fantastical. The folks you're killing are pixelated messes, without any facial details. This layer of abstraction is needed for a game about murdering innocent people.The up-tempo, funky soundtrack juxtaposes the slow gameplay, and there's a great variety of tunes for every party. Party Hard also tells a story of a detective chasing after Darius, with short cutscenes sprinkled in between each level. Both the writing and voice acting are awful, but they successfully come off being intentionally bad. It complements Party Hard’s silly tone and premise, and thankfully, storytelling isn’t the game’s focus.Your entertainment will come from planning deadly attacks in outlandish scenarios and environments. There’s enjoyment to be had with Party Hard’s dozen or so levels, despite the game’s lack of imagination in its later stages. It’s a wacky, bloody affair that never aspires for more."
2874,Battlefield 3,8.0,2,"     Combat is not just about where you are, but also about how you get there, and the variety of vehicles is one of the things that makes Battlefield so uniquely engaging. Small maps might only have a Humvee or a light armored vehicle, while larger ones boast buggies, tanks, amphibious transports, helicopters, and jets. There are a few variations within each class of vehicle that make them better suited for troop transport, anti-infantry, antiair, or anti-vehicle combat, and learning how to get the most out of each one is a blast, even if you're sometimes the one getting blown up. Whether you're piloting, gunning, or just going along for the ride, vehicles offer a key tactical element that can change the tide of battle when used by a savvy squad. Using a vehicle well can earn you powerful upgrades and bonus weapons, but it can be tough to get the hang of the flight mechanics for helicopters and jets. It's a shame there's no way to practice flying them outside of active multiplayer matches (with one exception), though you can take comfort in knowing that you are at least entertaining your fellow players when your jet nose-dives into a mountain.    Battlefield: Bad Company 2, so now the assault class slings health packs and totes defibrillators, while the support class carries light machine guns and ammunition boxes. Engineers still thrive on vehicle support/destruction, and recon delivers long-range death. New gadgets like robots that can arm charges (engineer) and mark targets (recon) give players more to look out for on the battlefield, and claymores and mortars (support) ensure that the engineer class isn't the only one packing an explosive punch. Unlockables include class-specific weapons and gadgets, gun-specific sights and attachments, and specializations that can make you tougher and deadlier. Focusing on one class to unlock higher level gear has its advantages, but so does spreading around your progress in an effort to be more adaptable to the ebb and flow of combat.    Battlefield 2: Modern Combat, but in spirit, the competitive multiplayer is a refined version of that offered in Bad Company 2. Nevertheless, it will be immediately familiar to veteran players of either game, though fans of Bad Company 2 will encounter a few other small but notable differences. Buildings are not easily destroyed in Battlefield 3 and underslung grenade launchers are, as of now, far less prevalent. Furthermore, you can't just run up to someone and stab him in the face for an instant kill; you need to get in two swipes or sneak up from behind. Nor can you simply rely on explosives to destroy M-COM stations in Rush mode because arming and detonating the charge is now the only way to progress.       As with the previous Battlefield games, the focus is on teamwork. Diverse loadouts encourage you and your squad to make complementary choices, and point bonuses reward you for working together. Every vehicle is better with teammates in it, and even the simple act of spotting enemies is an effective way to contribute to your team's efforts. Teamwork is woven throughout the fabric of Battlefield 3's multiplayer action, and when your team is working well together, it's one of the most gratifying experiences you can have in a game.     Battlefield 3 also has six cooperative missions that require teamwork on a smaller scale. These stand-alone sorties have a narrative connection to the campaign, but they are tougher to complete than most campaign missions and you can unlock some nice weapons for use in the multiplayer. Chatting with your teammate is helpful here, especially in the stealthy sections, because the spotting mechanic doesn't sufficiently differentiate enemies at long distances. Your foes are fairly tough, even on normal difficulty, though some unexpected quick-time events can also catch you off guard. The most notable mission here puts you in the cockpit of a helicopter, which provides the only chance outside of multiplayer to practice your flying skills. Earning all of the weapon unlocks requires repeat playthroughs of these missions, so it's a shame there aren't more of them to keep you busy.     Finally, there's the campaign. Battlefield 3's single-player adventure tells a harrowing tale of a fictional modern conflict. It follows a familiar formula by delivering a short campaign with diverse combat scenarios and dramatic set pieces. The story is solid and has some good acting, but the ""Now tell us about this mission"" interrogation mechanic makes the structure feel stale (having made a notable appearance in last year's Call of Duty: Black Ops). The focus on realism makes the unrealistic elements like the heavy-handed linearity, quick-time events, and reckless foes even more noticeable, but most disappointing of all is the campaign's utter failure to capitalize on any of the series' strengths. The lively personality of the Bad Company games is nowhere to be found, nor is the operational freedom on which the series has thrived. When you climb into the cockpit of a fighter jet, you are merely the gunner in an on-rails sequence rather than the hotshot pilot. There are some beautiful environments and a few exciting sequences, but these are outweighed by the overly familiar cityscapes and set pieces that were clearly inspired by other shooter campaigns from the past few years. This contributes to the pervasive sense that this campaign is not only outdated, but also outclassed.      Fortunately, Battlefield 3's competitive multiplayer is among the best in its class, providing immensely rich and immersive combat zones. Though there are still some intermittent server issues that might cause you to lose your connection or put you in an unpopulated game, these are infrequent occurrences that aren't likely to keep you from having a blast online. Battlefield 3 may not offer much beyond the multiplayer, but there are so many ways to contribute and feel like a powerful soldier that after hours and hours of playing, all you'll want to do is play more.    "
1563,Victor Vran,6.0,1," Diablo III and The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing. But in its defense, Victor Vran does introduce some elements that, while not exactly breaking the mold, help it stand out at least somewhat from the pack. For example, there are no traditional classes to speak of in Victor Vran. And, as this is Victor’s story, there are also no options to pick different characters of varying styles, backgrounds, or gender. Instead, the character you create is a meld of outfits, weapons, demon powers, and destiny cards, all of which coalesce into a Victor of your own personal design. Every weapon type, from sword to shotgun or scythe, comes matched with two slowly recharging special abilities. For instance, the shotgun offers a spread or precision shot, while the war hammer sends you flying into the air only to come crashing down in a thunderous shock wave. Two weapons can be equipped at once, increasing the abilities at your disposal. You can also equip up to two demon powers, which offer offensive or defensive skills, such as casting an aura that increases physical damage or calling down a pillar of scorching flame. Using these abilities takes overdrive, which gets recharged by use of special outfits, each granting an armor rating and a new look. Destiny cards are a special element of the customization. You can equip a handful of these cards at a time, each one granting an attribute such as gaining health with every strike, increasing critical attack damage, or creating an icy explosion. Swapping around all these elements on the fly is fast and easy, allowing you to exchange equipment and abilities to match each situation. External factors often play a role in what “class” you choose to run. If I was playing solo, I built a character with high defense, equipping cards that gave me the ability to absorb health, and an increased overdrive recharge rate. But if I was in a party, I would equip the sanguine aura, which healed myself and nearby allies while keeping up my defense. Equip a hammer with this build, and just like that, I had a makeshift paladin. Or I could go in the reverse direction, upping my movement speed and long-range attack damage, and equipping a shotgun to create an agile gunslinger. Though enjoyable, the customization does come with a caveat. The lack of disparate classes discourages replayability, which causes the game to hit its plateau at around 15 hours. You can keep trudging ever onwards, of course, searching for even better loot or completing many of the in-stage challenges that offer a deluge of rewards. There is also the unlockable Bottomless Pit arena, which sets you against endless waves of powerful enemies for a chance at rare loot. But I found these distractions to be merely that: distractions that were not compelling enough to pique interest for very long. The exciting, fast-paced combat is easily the game’s best feature. Battles crackle with energy as you fight mobs of enemies. Demonic powers clash, creating a lightshow of glowing neon colors as ice, electricity, and fire dance across the field. Combat is hard-hitting and immensely satisfying, and watching as a large group of creaking skeletons explode into chunks of bone from a shotgun blast or well-placed bomb never gets old. The battle--and really, the game as a whole--are even better when bringing in up to three allies who add their own particular abilities, creating a maelstrom of intense energy. The difficulty rises naturally as you progress, although you can activate up to five hexes that increase the challenge and reward you in additional experience points and items.   Unfortunately, the enjoyment combat brings doesn’t completely escape unscathed. Victor Vran’s hectic battles can get confusing, especially since many of your foes wield the same demonic powers as you and your allies. Due to this, it often becomes difficult to differentiate between the powers of friends and enemies until you get smacked by a damaging blast that chips your life away. Also, when the combat gets loud and heavy, it’s not unusual to notice lag spikes, causing allies and enemies alike to zip around on the screen for a second or two before settling down. The boss fights are generally forgettable. At one point in the story, you will fight and defeat a large spider boss, only to fight another spider boss not long after--this second one made even more boring due to its predictable attack and movement pattern. Worst of all, however, is the weight of tedium that increases the longer you play. The severe lack of enemy variety hurts longevity. There are only so many enemy variants, and most of the time stronger opponents are merely palette swaps of the same enemy type. The option to roll and jump in Victor Vran does make the combat more nimble and faster-paced than that of its RPG cousins. Rolling allows you to quickly dodge oncoming attacks and move around a skirmish quickly. Jumping is a great addition, allowing you to hop onto higher platforms and rain hellfire onto enemies below. It also allows you to experience brief instances of platform jumping when the path ahead of you has gaps to cross. You can even wall-jump, which grants you access to even higher ledges or hidden areas with secret treasure to pilfer. The jumping isn’t perfect, however, as you’re unable to go from a higher platform to a lower one without having to jump down, which feels awkward. Also, there are areas with walls you can wall-jump over (though this doesn’t make sense in buildings or shafts where a ceiling would prevent such a maneuver). That is, if the game’s controls even allow you to make the jump. By default, Victor Vran employs a control scheme that features movement with directional keys, as opposed to the mouse. It’s a strange choice for this type of game, and I couldn’t get comfortable with the limited scope of movement. You can choose the mouse-only control scheme, used by most games of this genre, but it’s absolutely horrid. Movement is broken, causing you to fight to get to where you want to go. Trying to jump using the mouse is nearly impossible, as you must click as close to the edge as possible before hitting the appropriate key. Most of the time, Victor will leap straight up in the air while sometimes performing a little twirl, before landing and making you try again. Typically in games of this type, holding down the left mouse button causes your character will move in that direction. But here, if you move your mouse past a nearby wall or ledge, Victor will immediately start following a path directly to where your mouse is pointed, instead of moving in that direction. Confused regarding your intent, he stutters in a circle--a move that becomes more aggravating the longer you play. You can’t even pass behind a pillar or under a stone archway without the pathfinding getting befuddled and causing you to briefly pause in place. On top of this, Victor also frequently gets stuck on walls and objects. The directional key movement is better, but I found using the controller to be the best solution, as it removes any major problems associated with the other two options. The auto-aim also could use some tweaking of its threat detection, as more than once you’ll find yourself blasting apart boxes or couches instead of a demon just off to the side. Killing heaps of Victor Vran monsters is only half the fun; the rest is stuffing your pockets with as much loot as possible. You travel throughout Zagoravia, greedily scooping up dropped goods, including weapons, gold, destiny cards, outfits, and dyes, which add a splash of color to your look. Items are picked up simply by walking over them. And with your enormous personal inventory and the pace of the game constantly pushing you onward, you will rarely stop for long as you move onto the next set of enemies in hungry anticipation of even more spoils. Most items you stash away are junk, but they’re never completely useless. Castle Zagore, the game’s central hub where you stage your fight against the supernatural, includes shops to sell old loot or buy something new, as well as a storage chest to store excess items. Then, when you reach level 16, you gain access to the transmutation machine. With it, you can combine unwanted items for the chance to create something better or to improve the stats of gear you want to keep. When it comes to loot, those are your only options, as you can’t trade with your fellow players. So if your friend happens to pick up a weapon or destiny card you need--well, that’s tough luck. You have to find or purchase your own gear. Victor Vran’s steampunk-inspired world is very detailed, featuring destructible objects that break or shatter across the ground as combat heats up. Leaves fall gently from trees, crystal formations glow with a soft light in caves, and green mists float gently over desecrated cemetery grounds. The city streets are lined with houses, as well as shops with goods you can see through windows, and tall buildings. Most tall structures and obstacles crumble out of view when the camera draws close, allowing you to peer through. However, sometimes those objects don’t melt away, obstructing the screen. You can swing the camera around for a better view, but needing to reposition it at every other fight becomes irritating fast. Being attacked while fidgeting with the camera is another annoying reality you’ll sometimes have to face. Character development is close to nil, but the vocal work is actually not bad at all. Victor himself is voiced by the gravelly, monotone Doug Cockle, instantly recognizable as the man behind Geralt of The Witcher fame. The most standout character, however, is almost impossible to ignore. Throughout the story, you hear the voice of a mysterious man who calls himself, well, “the voice,” who on occasion talks to you telepathically. His helpfulness, however, is debatable. He chimes in from time to time, either to play a quick prank on Victor or insult his hat--though some of his dialogue can be clunky at times, and his sense of humor is a tad aged. I mean, how much longer must we endure that damn “arrow to the knee” joke? This odd narrator does add some humor to Victor Vran, but it’s not like the game is completely devoid of playfulness. It slips in plenty of references ranging from Skyrim to The Ghostbusters. On occasion, you’ll also run into a horde of dancing skeletons that send out a damaging aura that forces you to dance along. It is funny, though I would have found it more amusing if the choreography wasn't based on the ""Gangnam Style"" dance. Oh, and let’s not forget about the legendary hand mortar that fires exploding chickens. Because that’s a thing you can actually get. There are problems with just about every aspect of Victor Vran. The issues range from small to large, from the glitches to frequent crashes and audio cutouts. Still, there’s a lot to enjoy about it. Not only is it aesthetically pleasing, but the entertaining combat, above all else, is what would get me to return and burn away more hours hunting the creatures of the night. The lack of content and variety is a concern, though this may be alleviated with the planned free DLC. Victor Vran has more demons than just the ones that haunt its macabre streets, but with some time and healing, it could end up much stronger."
2407,Poker Night 2,7.0,2,"   The Venture Bros., Ash Williams from The Evil Dead, Claptrap from Borderlands, and Sam, the canine half of Telltale's anthropomorphic freelance police duo, make for a quirky crew to compete against. The addition of Portal's murderously passive-aggressive GLaDOS as the dealer rounds out the group perfectly. A humorous opening sequence leads you down into the Inventory, introduces the characters, and offers enough setup to give a touch of context to the proceedings. From there, it's time to throw down the chips and watch the silliness unfold.     Poker Night 2 sticks closely to the original game's format, though you do have the option of playing either Texas hold 'em or the somewhat more forgiving Omaha hold 'em. In either case, tournaments start with a $20,000 buy-in and progress across numerous hands until you either run out of cash and get knocked out or are the last one at the table. The AI does a decent job of betting and bluffing to keep hands interesting, and plying your opponents with inebriating beverages makes it easier to figure out their tells. That said, even when they're at full cognitive capacity, they rarely deliver the same level of challenge that you would get playing poker with even reasonably skilled human opponents. This likely won't be a big deal for less hardcore poker fans who are drawn in by the game's roster. The gameplay is enjoyable on a casual level, but it's really the characters you're playing against and their distinct personalities that make Poker Night 2 worth experiencing.     The casual storytelling vignettes, funny gags, and random conversations that strike up across the table throughout the course of each hand really make it feel like you're playing with a group of pals. Some of the dialogue is absolutely hilarious, while other jokes miss the mark by a hair. GLaDOS' presence is a particular delight, though her dialogue isn't quite as diabolical as her interactions in the Portal series, and she's subsequently less funny as a result. Claptrap is a hyperactive hoot that contrasts nicely with Brock's machismo, Ash's ramblings on demonic possession, and Sam's great one-liners. Well-written dialogue and immaculate voice work draw you into the near-constant character interactions--even to the point where you stop playing at times just to pay attention to what the characters have to say.        Unfortunately, some of the humor relies too heavily on being familiar with the characters' backstories and the franchises they're pulled from. The other problem is that the dialogue grows repetitious quickly. The audio gags and discussions are amusing the first time you hear them, but they get annoying when you start hearing the same ones over and over again from one tournament to the next. While there is a lot of variety, the game burns through its stock of laughs quickly if you play a few tournaments back-to-back, since recycled phrases and stories pop up after only a couple of hours of play.     Despite its repetitive nature and limited scope, Poker Night 2 does have lots of replay value, thanks to plenty of in-game unlockables and extras. Even when you lose, playing a tournament earns you tokens based on your performance. These can be spent on drinks for opponents to give yourself the upper hand, or you can buy chip sets, tables, and other gameplay elements themed after the featured characters. Completing specific challenges within a tournament also gives you a shot at winning each character's special item, and it's possible to unlock accessories to use in Borderlands 2. Additionally, PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 owners can open up Team Fortress 2 items, Xbox Avatars, and premium themes, respectively. While these perks aren't a huge reward, they do offer some added incentive to keep playing.       A great mix of characters and ample personality give Poker Night 2 some strong pull in its early stretches. The poker play works well enough to keep you trucking along to hear all of the funny tales and to experience the dialogue vignettes. Though the outlandish character interactions are the highlight, the lack of multiplayer feels like a huge missed opportunity. Once you've seen the game's breadth of character interactions and unlocked a few extras, there's not much reason to stick around. Therefore, you'll get a lot more mileage out of Poker Night 2 in short bursts. It's fun while it lasts, but that's not very long to begin with.  "
2538,Tryst,4.0,0,"Starcraft formula, and comes with a ton of problems. Speedy missions and a straightforward base-building-and-battling recipe pique your interest for a little while, but a fleeting campaign, inconsistent difficulty, a range of irritating bugs, and the absence of anything interesting in multiplayer gives the game a very short shelf life.        If you have ever played an RTS before, you won't have any problems figuring out what Tryst is all about. The campaign story is the same old claptrap about evil aliens waging war with humans, this time about 1,000 years from now on a colony world called Ishtonia. The aliens are sci-fi stereotypes, consisting solely of biomechanical monsters called the Zali, who turn on humanity at the start of play. They launch a surprise attack after years of peaceful coexistence and assassinate the current president, who represents the Rhyn Tech Corporation in some kind of corporate oligarchy. This leaves protagonist Ivan Petrovich in charge of the inevitable counterattack and making peace with a bunch of rebels consisting of an underclass apparently imported from Earth's prisons. The plot doesn't amount to a whole lot. Tensions between the two human factions are washed away with a quickie alliance in the second campaign mission, and the Zali are the traditional vile extraterrestrials who just want to kill all humans.     Gameplay covers the same old ground. You build bases, gather resources, crank out troops, and assault the enemy. There are two resources--ore and electricity--both of which are handled automatically with stations that accumulate these goodies. Some buildings can be upgraded. And a tech tree of advancements in the ARM, or Augmentation Research Mechanism system, lets you trick out troops and other units with various weapon and equipment buffs like shields, health regeneration, and so forth. The only aspect of the mission design that stands apart from RTS rivals is the speed. Missions fly by due to zippy building times, fast-walking units, and enemies that waste no time hammering your positions. It's like everyone involved has someplace better to be, so they sprint through objectives.     Missions play out in a straightforward fashion where you go through a building phase and head out to explore the map and take over enemy positions and resource points. The only variance is that sometimes you start at a base and sometimes you have to explore the map and go through a fair number of battles before you get to any building. Some diversions, such as being forced to choose between objectives and being pressed on multiple fronts simultaneously, keep scenarios from running on rails too much, at least, and add serious challenge, especially to the closing moments of an assignment.         Difficulty is a problem in spots, though. The campaign ranges from incredibly easy to insanely hard with no warnings about what you're going to run into around the next corner, and the closing missions see you reloading saves dozens of times. Some of the insta-fail conditions are overly demanding, too, as in the grueling fourth mission where you need to keep all four members of your tiny assault team alive against ridiculous odds. Only the simpleminded enemy AI lets you get through some of the tougher moments, as you can regularly draw one or two enemies away from larger packs of foes, kill them, and then go back for more.     Tryst's single-player campaign does not last long, though. Just like the gameplay itself, the campaign flies by. This leaves you with solo skirmish play and multiplayer to keep the game fresh. Neither are great options, however. Skirmish play is limited by a paltry number of maps, and because few people are currently playing the game online, multiplayer isn't much of a draw. Both offer the same speedy play of the campaign. Everything moves very quickly, especially in a skirmish against the computer, where enemy attacks on your base arrive early and often.        Bugs are also prevalent, though not significant enough to ruin the game. Error messages occasionally pop up, with messages of missing special effects and errors that are logged and sent on to the developers. Pathfinding is a pain, especially with larger units, because they often run into one another on the game's mostly narrow roadways and wind up taking circuitous routes that can put them in harm's way. Even smaller units sometimes stop well before getting to their destinations near groups of allies, even when those destinations are clear and in the open.         Additionally, saving is erratic because the game doesn't always sync properly: you might save with troops fully healthy and ready to rock, but then reload the game and find that you're back a minute earlier and in another part of the map. The game might even load in the middle of an enemy assault that was not present when the game was saved. Load times are extremely long, which is maddening in the later campaign missions, where you get wiped out a fair bit. Crashes are another problem: the game locks up often when loading a save or trying to exit. Thankfully, crashes don't occur when missions are under way, so game progress isn't usually affected.     From a production standpoint, Tryst provides just what it has to, and no more. There are no animated cutscenes beyond the opening of the game, for instance, and even buildings don't so much explode as they suddenly turn into blackened rubble. The graphics engine keeps up with the action with minimal slowdown even during intense firefights, although detail is limited, especially when the camera is in its default position. You have to zoom in pretty close to tell one unit type from another, which isn't advisable given the speed of battles.         Alien backgrounds set an atmospheric scene at least, with standard turf and dirt tracks combining with unworldly fauna and glowing swamps. Music and voice acting underscore the game's limited budget. While there are a full cast of voice actors and plenty of scripted plot points, the voice actors themselves are a United Nations of odd accents. And the order acknowledgments are so limited that you will be climbing the walls before the end of your first mission, after hearing comments about covering the six and hoping that the objective will soon be something shiny. Grunts would have been preferable.     Even with its negatives, Tryst can provide some entertainment for a few hours. There isn't anything here that stretches your RTS skills, so you can sit down and start playing on the fly without bothering to learn anything new. Such easy accessibility means that you see just about everything that the game has to offer in too little time, though, which is enough time for the game to completely wear out its welcome due to its many bugs and design flaws.     "
1028,Arktika.1,7.0,2,"Arktika embodies the Metro series' grim futuristic feel despite not being a Metro game, taking place in the frozen wastelands of Russia where environmental disasters have reshaped both the land and its inhabitants. Some unfortunate humans have mutated into nightmarish monsters, desperate raiders roam the land fighting for survival at all costs, and you’ve been brought in as a hired gun to protect a remote military outpost from these looming threats.Arktika isn’t a first-person shooter in the sense of Metro or Doom so much as it is a throwback to classic coin-op light gun games like Time Crisis or House of the Dead. Over the course of about five to eight hours, you’ll lean, duck, and dual-wield a variety of firearms while regularly teleporting short distances to advantageous positions and out of harm's way. Arktika is not a sedate game, and requires enough room to move from side to side, duck behind cover and pop out to line up your next kill.There isn't much enemy variety, but they are different enough from each other to require a solid mix of strategies during any given scenario. Normal soldiers can be shot up fairly easily, while snipers rely on distance and cover, and heavies must be shot in the head to take down.Arktika's weapons consist of different types of pistols, from a classic revolver to sci-fi energy guns. Different guns require unique reload gestures, which is confusing at first and sometimes unresponsive, but it feels like a fun throwback to the reloading mechanics of Time Crisis and other similar games. You even holster your guns by placing them on your shoulders. Using Oculus Touch controllers as your weapons and moving your actual body to hide behind cover, engagements are intense, making a successful pistol juggling act feel consistently rewarding.While the main focus is definitely on gunplay, there are other VR-specific touches as well. Using the Touch controllers, you’ll reach out and virtually grab and pull switches, push buttons, interact with screens, and even solve puzzles. Puzzles include tasks like searching for door codes, accessing terminals, changing fuses, and even redirecting the flow of power to systems by plugging in cables. Most of these elements are really just an excuse to provide a brief respite from shooting sequences and certainly aren’t overly challenging, but succeed in breaking up the gameplay enough so Arktika doesn’t entirely feel like mindless blasting.The shooting galleries are detailed and full of animated elements that can be used to your advantage with proper timing, like the unsteady motions of trunk lids on old sports cars that can be used for cover. Since the enemy is also smart about using cover, it’s vital to keep moving from point to point to get the best possible angle. Some of the cover is also destructible (like glass walls or crowded shelving), but 4A Games has designed its sets with a frenetic, active sensibility. The game goes out of its way to force you to make creative shots, leaning out from cover to aim between sweet spots of crowded landscapes. The end result is exciting and even tense action that ensures you'll stay on the move.The action is enhanced thanks to the excellent graphics, which offer a terrific sense of depth and scale. Arktika uses the 4A Engine (used in Metro 2033) to create one of the most visually impressive action games on Oculus Rift, where even the mission selection room looks cluttered and palpable, and the outside environments, like the abandoned parking lot, show off the apocalyptic nature of the world without needing any exposition."
2791,All Zombies Must Die!,6.0,1,"   Left 4 Dead, and these screens do a good job of keeping your attention during down moments.      All Zombies Must Die takes place in a small town overrun by a horde of undead freaks. There are eight different areas and four unique characters that you slowly gain access to as you get deeper into the game. The action plays out much as you would expect; you walk around with one stick, aim with the other, and tap the fire button to extinguish your foes. Zombies burst into bloody chunks when you pump them full of hot lead, but your weapons lack impact, which dulls much of the excitement. The pistol has erratic aiming even at point-blank range and the machine gun might as well be firing peanuts. Melee weapons are even more problematic. Charging up is the most effective tactic, but it's impossible to take the time to do so when you're surrounded. Crowds are an ongoing issue in All Zombies Must Die. A flood of zombies can unexpectedly rush at you, and if you're in tight confines, it's incredibly difficult to break free. Poor collision detection and obscured camera angles pile onto the problems in these moments, and because you often have to travel through narrow corridors to complete levels, it's tricky to avoid these cheap deaths.     Despite these issues, it can still be fun to exterminate zombies when you get in a good rhythm. A wide assortment of enemy types require you to confront them in different ways, and trying to circle behind an armored SWAT zombie while avoiding the clutching claws of a mutant makes for satisfying encounters. If you use the formidable shotgun and have plenty of ammunition, you can avoid many of the problems, though a teeming gang can always surround you when you least expect it. These random difficulty spikes ensure things rarely go smoothly for long in All Zombies Must Die. Falling in battle means you have to replay long stretches, and all of that wasted progress is a serious detriment.       All Zombies Must Die uses objectives to hide the fact that most of the time, you're just killing zombies. Some of your tasks are obvious, such as exterminating a set number of foes, but most require thought beyond mindless genocide. For instance, you may have to kill 10 electrified joggers, so not only do you have to find these specific enemies, but you also have to zap them up with a cattle prod beforehand. Having to complete these specific goals makes this feel almost like a small-scale massively multiplayer online game, and the random item drop rates tie into this idea. Collecting three hamburgers, for instance, requires you to kill indiscriminately until the monsters drop what you want. Initially, this quest system is so novel that it adds to the fun. Dual-stick shooters usually don't present such diverse objectives, and figuring out how to progress is enticing. But things take a turn for the worse after a few hours. Simply walking from one part of the city to another requires you to complete a handful of quests. Tangible progress is replaced by these tedious goals, thus extending the length of your adventure long after the entertainment has faded.      Although the point-and-shoot combat is often flawed, there are environmental activities to keep things feeling fresh. As in other zombie games, car alarms factor into how you vanquish your foes. If you trigger this piercing sound to stun nearby zombies, then they have a higher chance of dropping important collectibles. Low on ammo? Desperate for more health? You can get out of a potentially bad situation with a bit of ingenuity. Radiation pits turn ordinary zombies into horrible mutants; this may sound bad, but they drop brains that give you temporary immunity. Plus, if you'd rather loot than kill, levels are littered with collectibles that do everything from refresh your life and pump up your experience points to give you access to developer trading cards. None of these elements are particularly impressive on their own, but they add much needed diversity to the mindless killing, which is certainly appreciated amidst the tiresome shooting.        There are also elements outside of the combat to keep you invested. In addition to bloody chunks of decaying flesh, zombies cough up experience points when they die. When you accumulate enough, you can upgrade your character's stats to improve your health, defense, speed, and power. Ultimately, speed is the least effective of these, so if you want to avoid death, all of your characters turn out with similar skill sets. But it's still nice to see your characters grow stronger while the world crumbles around them. There's also a simple crafting system that gives you access to interesting weapons. When you imbue your firearms with various elemental powers, such as radiation or fire, you can watch the zombies react to these horrific attacks. Although some crafting is required to advance the story, most of it is optional, and it's fun to experiment to see exactly what tool of destruction you can conjure up next.      All Zombies Must Die is an ambitious entry in the top-down, dual-stick shooter genre, and most of its ideas are successful. Giving you activities to partake in outside of combat does a good job of keeping you engaged, and even the story adds to the enjoyment. But the combat is so flawed that it saps much of that goodwill. Getting overwhelmed by a crowd of zombies (with little chance to escape) is an all-too-common cause of death, and the relentless backtracking makes progress a tiresome slog. All Zombies Must Die has a lot of potential, but poor design choices ultimately hold back its bold ambition.   "
904,Agony,3.0,0,"Hell, by its very nature, shouldn't be enjoyed, but there's still something enthralling and entertaining in seeing creators imagine it in various ways. Agony, on the other hand, is less about Hell as a vehicle for entertainment or even fear. Agony's version of Hell is simply a place of unimaginable horror. It is depraved beyond reckoning, a place whose very brick and mortar is composed of atrocities. It is a place that never opens its sick, emaciated maw except to blaspheme and torment. Hell is terrifying in Agony, which goes hand in hand with the fact that the game is also torturous to play.In Agony, you are a freshly fallen wretch who wakes up at the gates of Hell with his memories--including his true name--burned away during the trip down. Under normal circumstances, it'd be torture time for the rest of eternity, but somehow, the new meat walks through the gates with most of his wits about him, and only one piece of knowledge: that Hell has a guardian angel, the Red Goddess. Only she can help him regain his lost memories, and help him escape perdition. So begins a long, arduous journey of survival horror--closer in function to Clock Tower or Alien Isolation than Resident Evil--to meet the Goddess, and beg for her dark blessing.Agony's single most breathtaking achievement is Hell itself. It is an enormous, heretical province of terror, the ungodly conceptual Venn diagram between Hieronymous Bosch, H.R. Giger, and Clive Barker. The very ground you wake up on in the game's first level is made of rotting pink flesh, the mortar made from the crushed bodies and blood of the hideous unborn, a process a later cutscene even shows you in great detail. The architecture all around you is a pulsating gothic nightmare, cathedrals of wide-eyed corpses and skeletons, some of whom are still alive, trapped twitching inside for eternity.It's because the world itself is so impressive that the enemy design then comes across so disappointing and predictable. While beautiful in detail, demons look mostly like the typical Doom interpretation of demons, and female variants tend to veer closer to being strippers-with-sharp-teeth as opposed to something legitimately imaginative. The Red Goddess herself is a near constant source of eyerolls, mostly coming off as a bloodied burlesque performer, with an inappropriately over-the-top voice performance that wouldn't be out of place in a commercial for a sex hotline. There are design elements that push the envelope--mostly centered around some truly unsettling perversions of genitalia--but the game's ham-handed attempts to be sexy, even in a sinister manner, is incongruous with the skin-crawling nature of the rest of the game.All the wretched humans shambling around Hell--you included--are little more than desiccated revenants. You can walk--or, more accurately, shuffle along at a snail's pace--perform a limited sprint, and jump. There are no weapons to be had, though you can pick up torches, which provide light, but little else. When you come across an enemy, you have only three options: run, sneak, or hide. You can technically sneak around, and there’s even a power-up to be gained later that supposedly lessens the noise you make. It is still very, very easy to be heard and seen, hiding spots aren't always close by, and aside from a rising musical sting, there’s no indicator of where exactly an enemy is in relation to you.There's only a few different classes of enemy you see throughout your play time, ranging from swarms of insects to Lovecraftian behemoths that can snatch up your soul. With only a couple of exceptions, getting caught by an enemy is typically a one- or two-hit death. As such, an hour's work can be flushed down the toilet just by hitting the wrong enemy in a group. Later on, you can actually possess a few classes of demon, but this is never as empowering or thrilling as you might expect. Agony doesn't seem to know how to capitalize on its most promising aspects.You do, however, have one big trick up your shriveled sleeve: if you should die another death in Hell, your soul can actually fly out of your current body, and forcibly possess another. That's only if you can find a vulnerable victim, though, and pull off the black shroud preventing them from being possessed. Otherwise, after about 10-15 seconds of being dead again, your soul dies a true death. The trick of it is not just finding the last person you unshrouded, but typically finding them in a maze, with an extremely limited and obscured field of vision while disembodied. If/when you die, the Goddess keeps you in Hell, though, and sends you back to the last checkpoint. Even then, checkpoints are a whole other problem. They're represented by a special mirror, where a soul must be sacrificed, but the mirrors are hidden deep in each level. Agony treats basic progressional milestones the way most games treat obscure collectibles.The checkpoint issue is one tiny facet of the game's overarching issue: Hell is too big for its own good. Your one navigational tool, the Destiny Lines, sends out a little neon cluster of lights that can point you in the right direction, but often the cluster gets just as confused as you are, leading you through walls or ceilings, instead of along a proper route, which can be difficult to discern in the chaotic and painfully dim environments. In addition, on the game's default difficulty, the Lines are a limited resource. The idea here is sound, if the idea was, in fact, to make surviving in Hell feel like a Sisyphean struggle, wandering a realm that mortal men have no mastery over. It doesn't make for an enjoyable experience.When you're not losing chunks of progress, the rest of the game pits you up against two types of glorified scavenger hunts: collecting a small number of important objects and arranging them in a very specific way to open a door, or finding the correct sigil among dozens written in the environment that will unlock the next area. The first kind is usually easy enough, though oddly, the most difficult one in the game is right at the beginning, where you're thrown into an expansive labyrinth full of enemies, and no way to save your progress when you've grabbed any of the resources you need to continue. Others are easier, but still more of a trudging annoyance than anything. The second kind involves exploring around to find the sigil, often involving backtracks into dangerous areas, only to get back to the door and discover the sigil you picked up doesn't unlock your door. This kind of slow and infuriating repetition typifies Agony from start to finish.These are issues ironically exacerbated by the fact that it's all taking place in one of the most abominable, depressing, and fundamentally disgusting environments imaginable. Worst of all, you grow numb to Agony's uniquely repulsive flair over time. You start thinking about the environment in practical nonplussed terms, instead of the grim wonder that strikes you in the beginning. Distress turns to disinterest, then--even as the bigger revelations about the protagonist and the nature of his torture come to light--turn to total apathy. I entered Agony’s Gates of Hell with a slack-jawed gasp. It is such a disappointment to have to have left it with a shrug."
3414,Castle Crashers,8.0,2,"      It also makes playing a joy with its inventive and occasionally surprising level design, memorable boss fights, and slew of funny visual gags, movie references, and other comedic moments. (Be warned, though, that some of the humor is pretty lowbrow: you've never seen so many gags involving pooping animals in one place before.) The varied level design may see you walking along and fighting enemies one moment, escaping a massive monster while riding a runaway deer the next, and drifting down a roaring river the next. Castle Crashers maintains this terrific sense of creativity throughout its surprisingly lengthy campaign.        "
1436,Mario &amp; Luigi: Paper Jam,6.0,1,"As countless comic books can attest, one essential element of an effective story-driven crossover is the series of reactions when characters from separate universes meet. It’s especially amusing when there’s a doppelganger element, which is a key hook of Paper Jam. Most characters and their counterparts quickly get over the shock of their initial encounters. It’s precious to watch Toads help displaced paper Toads cope with new surroundings. Two Bowsers meeting up is a clash of egos, though their eventual partnership is foreseeable. And naturally, having two Princesses Peach is a mildly comical twist on the tiresome kidnapping premise. The only way a Nintendo crossover would be more precious would be a textile team-up between Yarn Kirby and a Wooly Yoshi.Paper Jam continues the Mario game tradition of establishing its narrative with an impressively concise introductory cutscene. It is revealed that the world of Paper Mario is contained in a casually filed book in a neglected room within Princess Peach’s castle in the Mario &amp; Luigi universe. All it takes is an overly curious and accident-prone Luigi to knock over the book to unleash the paper world’s inhabitants.If the classic components of a Mario game overworld--the kind with a Browser castle, a desert with two-toned sand, and an obligatory snow region--offers you comfort, there’s a lot more of that kind of familiarity in Paper Jam--which extends to the game's basic platforming sections. The humor and sight gags are pervasive, but seldom does the comedy ever achieve the same level of surprising wit found in prior Mario RPGs. The fragile alliance of the two Browsers leads to some funny banter, and there are comical scenes where the paper cast use their literal thinness to get out of jams. And let’s not forget the fourth wall-breaking jokes and self-referential humor, both of which are present here. These moments represent the standard issue comedy one should expect from the Mario RPGs; just don’t expect any laugh out loud moments in Paper Jam. Witnessing gigantic cardboard automatons, in their full corrugated glory, impose themselves on the Mario &amp; Luigi universe proves just as delightful as seeing Mario interact with his 2D counterpart.Those familiar with the Mario &amp; Luigi series know that its main challenges come during battle. Doing well involves learning the very specific, rhythmic timing of attacks and studying enemy animations to know when to press a button dodge or counterattack. In some ways, these factors make Paper Jam more involved than many JRPGs--at leas the kinds that let you get away with spamming the attack option against low to mid-level foes. With the steady stream of new enemy types (not to mention bosses), the demands in Paper Jam never let up. It’s what’s made the Mario &amp; Luigi games worthy of the attention of even the most dexterously talented players who get gratification from mastering frenetic action games.As a crossover that is already intriguing based on concept alone, it’s hard to blame Nintendo for playing it safe and predictable in its execution.Paper Jam’s lands are spacious, with an abundance of platforms and spaces that at first appear inaccessible, thereby encouraging players to explore. That said, I never felt guilty or anxious about not investigating every nook and cranny. That’s partly because level growth opportunities, gold, and useful consumables are seldom ever scarce. These factors, along with the option to make battles easier with an assist option--which reveals which party member an enemy is targeting during an attack--encapsulate Nintendo’s reputation for highly accessible games. This level of accessibility and the crossover premise also make Paper Jam the best gateway entry to both the Mario &amp; Luigi and Paper Mario series--a rare feat for a sequel.As a crossover that is already intriguing based on concept alone, it’s hard to blame Nintendo for playing it safe and predictable in its execution: undeniably adorable but bereft of genuine surprises or innovation. Of course Paper Mario would wield a giant papercraft hammer in battle. Of course a mix of 2D and 3D enemies would present an expanded variety of attacks. Of course Paper Mario would make himself useful by accessing passages too thin for Mario or Luigi.As Mario &amp; Luigi: Dream Team and Paper Mario: Sticker Star proved, Nintendo has a knack for showcasing new and inventive ideas in both series. Paper Jam effectively relies (and often coasts) on its novel crossover appeal. Bold experimentation will have to wait, perhaps in an installment where, conversely, Mario and Luigi visit Paper Mario’s world. I’d be on board with such a sequel, provided that it doesn’t suffer from the dialogue-heavy NPC interactions of prior Paper Marios."
42,The Expanse: A Telltale Series,9.0,2,"Within minutes of firing up the first episode of The Expanse: A Telltale Series, you'll be faced with a series of life-or-death choices. Though some choices may seem trivial at first, nearly all of them result in ""[character name] will remember that"" appearing in the top-left corner of the screen, leaving you to wonder what exactly will happen if that choice comes back to bite you a few episodes later. These kinds of narrative choices and consequences are a staple of the Telltale brand and, at first glance, one might mistake The Expanse for a clone of the studio's previous games, reskinned to reflect the appropriate franchise--but this couldn't be further from the truth.Upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that Deck Nine Games--the studio that developed Life Is Strange: True Colors and is Telltale's co-developer for this project--has quite literally added a new dimension to the standard Telltale formula. In The Expanse, players can freely explore the three-dimensional game environment, a first for Telltale, as the studio's previous games provided very little opportunity for exploration and freedom of movement.This change to a standard third-person perspective works wonders for immersion, especially given the game's large, detailed environments. The ability to hear Camina Drummer's inner monologue--something never seen on the show--also plays a huge part in bringing the game to life, creating a sense of connection between the player and the game's protagonist. In the television show, Drummer is known to be rather reclusive, rarely sharing her feelings aloud. The decision to let us hear her inner thoughts is a bold choice, but it works incredibly well due to the game's stellar writing and the performance of Drummer's voice actress.Cara Gee (who plays Drummer in The Expanse television series) reprises her role once again and Gee's powerful, emotive performance makes all the difference--it's hard to imagine the game without her. Unlike the television show, Telltale's The Expanse allows us to see a new, slightly more vulnerable side of the normally reserved, enigmatic Belter by serving as a prequel that details what Drummer's life was like leading up to the events of the television show. Interacting with objects will prompt Drummer to audibly share her thoughts on the matter at hand, and this mechanic is an excellent way to introduce Drummer to players who may not be familiar with the show.Of course, the game also includes a group of new characters, all of whom serve aboard the scavenger ship Artemis alongside Drummer. From the gruff, elderly pilot, Khan, to the contrasting personalities of the Morozov twins, Arlen and Rayen, Telltale's characters feel genuine, like they could just as easily fit into The Expanse television show or the book series upon which it is based. Your opinion of each character will change wildly as the narrative unfolds, but it always feels like these characters are each growing in a specific direction, not constantly wavering back and forth between trustworthy ally and loose cannon with a hair-trigger. It's a sharp contrast to the supporting characters of previous Telltale games, like Kenny from The Walking Dead series, who frequently bounced between ""helpful companion"" and ""selfish idiot who randomly turns on me when the plot decides it needs a twist.""Since Telltale's The Expanse is a prequel to the television series, Drummer's plot-armor is thicker than the hull of the Artemis, but her fellow crew members aren't as lucky. At the end of the fifth and final episode, players can find themselves with no crew members left alive except Drummer, or with the entire squad saved, depending on the choices Drummer makes. Despite being only five episodes long (with a sixth DLC episode set to release this fall), the game's characters are intriguing and believable enough for players to quickly form attachments, making it all the more devastating when you fail to save one of them.Aside from the ability to freely roam and explore, the most notable difference between The Expanse and Telltale's previous projects is the higher-quality animation. Deck Nine's commitment to striking visuals is immediately apparent within the first few minutes of the game. Instead of the cartoonish, stylized character designs of Telltale's previous games, The Expanse boasts more realistic graphics and cutscenes that don't constantly cut to a close-up shot to hide wonky animations--mainly because there weren't any wonky animations in need of hiding in my time with it. Cutscenes are extremely detailed but even outside of cutscenes, the game's interior environments feel lived-in and alive, while exteriors set in the vacuum of space feel appropriately enormous for a franchise called The Expanse.The game's biggest visual triumph is undoubtedly the characters' facial motion-capture and animations. Previous Telltale games often struggled with facial expressions, leaving characters looking stiff and strange. But Deck Nine's animations are smooth and realistic, with characters often sharing knowing looks that make you wonder what they're thinking, or having brief exchanges with Drummer that consist solely of body language and facial expressions. The positive effect of these moments cannot be overstated--every frame of every cutscene is executed with purpose, and between the characters' lovable (and sometimes love-to-hateable) personalities and the developer's determination to create cinematic cutscenes, it often feels like you're directing an episode of the television show, not just playing a game.But one of the game's strongest features is that, above all, it achieves its goal through a story that is strong enough to stand on its own. Some cutscenes have awkward gaps and pauses between lines, but it's a rare occurrence, and you'll never meet an NPC who spends a solid three minutes word-vomiting exposition at you before sending you on a fetch quest, which is a major plus. When it comes to both dialogue and actions, Drummer is almost always faced with only two options, but surprisingly, those options never feel like binary ""good"" and ""bad"" choices. Drummer isn't simply good or bad, a renegade or a paragon--she's just Drummer, a woman who has had to make incredibly difficult decisions all her life. It's rare that you'll come across a choice where one option immediately feels like it's the obvious ""right"" choice, unless you've found environmental context clues that point you in (what appears to be) the right direction.Despite the game's narrative arc hinging on various dialogue choices, The Expanse strongly adheres to a ""show, don't tell"" policy, using environmental storytelling in a way that makes the game's levels fun to explore even when there's no loot to be had. It's always worth taking a look around, especially when on board the Artemis. In fact, the Artemis is where you should do the most looking around, as objects Drummer can inspect often reveal helpful clues that make difficult decisions much easier. If Drummer notices a defaced poster on the wall, the next time you inspect it, there may be more graffiti added to it. If she comments on an unsecured item in a crew member's quarters and returns later, it will likely be lying on the floor in several pieces due to getting knocked around in zero-g.Unfortunately, zero-g movement is the game's biggest flaw. It looks gorgeous and realistic from a visual perspective, but in practice, using Drummer's vac-suit thrusters sends you floating across the infinite expanse of space at roughly the same speed as an exhausted tortoise. The suit has two speeds: slow, and slightly less-slow. When you're hunting down an item for a side quest in a massive ship graveyard, the realization that you need to backtrack is likely to be accompanied by a frustrated groan due to the amount of time it will take to retrace your steps. If you drift too far into space, a notification appears, informing you that you're leaving the safe zone. This, combined with the dark and often disorienting locations Drummer must explore early on in the game can make some levels more frustrating than they need to be.Another weak spot is the collectible mechanic. As you progress through the game, you'll be able to collect various valuables scavenged from derelict ships. Drummer often comments on what the item is, and which NPC crew member might find it useful. But there's no inventory for these items to be seen in, no opportunity to give them to anyone, and it's very difficult to tell if they're just there to give completionists something to do, or if they actually affect the plot. The main collectibles you'll need to worry about are made very obvious--they appear as side quests in the game's mission log, and are separated from the scavenged loot. The biggest problem here is that each level has a point of no return at the end, but it's never clear what exactly will trigger it. In Chapter 2, for instance, the main quest tasks you with finding three fuel sources, and also gives you two side quests with additional items that are important to specific characters. But if you complete the main quest before locating the side quest items, you'll immediately be thrown into a cutscene and will not be able to return and continue your search unless you restart the episode. A simple prompt asking you if you're ready to leave once you've completed a main quest (which often consists of several stages, making it even harder to discern how close you are to finishing it) would instantly solve this problem.Still, the game shines in just about every other category. One particularly impressive feat the developers somehow managed to pull off was making Drummer's words and actions believable, no matter which choices you make while playing as her. Whether it's amputating an innocent man's leg in the middle of a spacewalk or deciding to ""space"" a troublemaker (read: toss them out of an open airlock with no vac-suit), Drummer executes whatever option you choose in a manner that doesn't seem out of character for her, even when the options presented are polar opposites. Though Drummer's dialogue response options are usually limited to only two choices, these options almost always work flawlessly when it comes to authenticity. The dialogue choice descriptions are short, but The Expanse avoids forcing the player to choose a line of dialogue based on a misleading description--Drummer doesn't blurt out something entirely unexpected in a tone you didn't intend for her to use. You won't find yourself thinking, ""I didn't mean for her to say it like that,"" an issue often seen when RPG dialogue options are too short or too vague.The game's writing is, without question, its greatest strength. You'll laugh out loud at everything from snappy comebacks to humorously penned datapad entries. But just like the television show and book series, the game's sense of humor thankfully does not suffer from a Marvel-esque need to throw in a self-conscious joke every time there's a moment of tension, instead managing to stay perfectly balanced in the ""Goldilocks zone"" when it comes to comic relief. Moments of levity are there when appropriate, but intense scenes are given time to breathe--as are tender moments between Drummer and her love interest.The chemistry between Drummer and Martian ship mechanic Maya Castillo is palpable from the moment they meet. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide whether Drummer will pursue her romantically, and given the fact that Maya's the only romanceable NPC in the game, pursuing her seems like a forgone conclusion. In most RPGs, romance and survival aren't inherently tied together. In The Expanse, romance is a moral conundrum from the moment it presents itself. The Artemis is a small ship--people are bound to find out, and crew members will often allude to the idea that one person or another is being shown favoritism even before you have the opportunity to pursue Maya. Other realistic dilemmas also result from this potential romance. If you don't respond to Maya's romantic overtures, will the offer be gone for good, or will Drummer get another chance to make a move? The game gives itself room to evoke these questions of morality and logistics by focusing on a single relationship. One would think that Maya's presence alone means it's meant to be. Perhaps it is, but the game's atmosphere constantly communicates reminders that every move Drummer makes has a butterfly effect on the rest of the game. The biggest romantic dilemma most RPG protagonists typically face is choosing which NPC to woo. But The Expanse forces you to answer better, more interesting questions. Not just, ""Am I interested in her?"" but ""Is this a good idea right now? Is it a good idea at all?"" Telltale's Expanse is a masterclass in narrative design, and subsequent playthroughs will reveal that, unlike some of the studio's previous offerings, almost every single choice the player makes does have a unique outcome. The Expanse doesn't present you with the illusion of choice, where you're constantly making decisions, but only a few of them actually matter. It cleverly utilizes environmental clues, subtle facial animations, and other non-verbal hints to allow you to find answers to your questions, rather than spoon-feeding you expositional dialogue. Whether your goal is learning more about Virgil, the ship's secretive medic, or simply figuring out who stole Khan's BBQ sauce, Telltale's Expanse leaves no stone unturned, and no loose end untied.More than that, The Expanse has what I've been searching for in Telltale games since The Walking Dead Season 1: soul. Characters don't feel disposable, death doesn't feel inevitable, and happiness doesn't seem as hopelessly out-of-reach as it does in Game of Thrones or The Walking Dead, which makes for a refreshing change. The Expanse is not populated with throwaway characters who already feel doomed to be a victim for the sake of drama, or soulless zombies who can be killed without a second thought. If you fire a weapon in The Expanse, you are changing the life of a real human being, and the game makes sure you know it. Because every NPC companion can be saved, being unable to save one of them (or having to make the painful choice not to) hits hard, even if that character poses a significant risk to Drummer or the rest of the crew.In a world of enormous RPGs with seemingly endless side quests and huge maps, The Expanse: A Telltale Series is a refreshing change of pace, and proves that sometimes, less is more. A great RPG doesn't necessarily need to be a 60-hour adventure; it just needs to convincingly drop you into another person's magboots. The Expanse does that and then some, forcing you to make difficult decisions that will haunt you long after you've finished playing."
3095,Garshasp: The Monster Slayer,5.0,1,"God of War. This third-person action adventure drinks deeply from the well of Kratos and company, attempting to emulate its cinematic use of camera angles, its quick-time events, and its hard-hitting combat. But where God of War is the master, Garshasp is merely the promising student, striking similar notes but lacking what makes its inspiration so easy to love. The problems are basic ones. Broken collision detection, limp sound effects, and stuttering animations dull the edge of combat. Sluggish controls and unhelpful camera angles frequently intrude as well. Garshasp echoes an epic adventure; the regal voice acting, the calls of French horns, and ambitious art design do their part to stir your interest. But the game's execution fails its vision: It's messy where it needed to be tight and awkward where it required fluidity.        Yet there's an admirable heart clearly beating within Garshasp. It's based on Iranian mythology and tells the story of its titular hero, who sets out to avenge the bloody death of his brother and eventually confront a monstrous ogre called Hitasp. The tale is recounted by an enthusiastic narrator in a sonorous baritone, which gives the game an air of grandiosity. This grandiosity is matched by the environments, where suspended walkways span rocky red-brown cliffs and wooden platforms float atop the waters of a murky swamp. Impressive cutscenes punctuate key moments--it's just unfortunate that they aren't enough to draw you in completely. You know your motives only because the narrator tells you of them; not because you experience any loss or anger firsthand. Looming spires and the beats of a bass drum provide the right atmosphere, but they aren't a substitute for proper storytelling.     And so you traverse those walkways and jump on those platforms, with the camera dramatically swooping about, doing its best to simulate a fantasy film. As in God of War, you have no camera control and must trust the scripted angles to accommodate the action. Sometimes the camera does just fine, drifting above while you pull a lever or pulling in close to emphasize battle. Other times, it's a disaster. Take the first boss battle, in which you slash away at a growling hulk while dodging or blocking its attacks. Should you dodge to your enemy's far side, you can't see your own character and must either hope you are responding to your attacker's animations properly or try to make your way back to the foreground. Getting to a more feasible spot wouldn't be so problematic if Garshasp's troublesome controls and collision detection didn't work against you. Whether you use a controller or mouse and keyboard, you don't always roll in the direction you think you should. And because objects, walls, and enemies seem to be surrounded by invisible padding, you often roll to a halt when it appears that you should dodge away cleanly.         The collision issues carry over to the combat as well. When you should be making contact with your sword (and later, an enormous bludgeon), it sometimes passes right through your demonic foes. Landing a hit looks much the same as a miss; thus, combat loses its impact, with the weak slashing sounds emphasizing the sloppiness. Though it may not be as tight as it should have been, swordplay is solid enough to satisfy on a basic level. You string light and strong attacks into combos, as well as unlock new moves as you progress. Encounters with weak but agile creatures are mixed in with stronger mutants protecting themselves with shields. Should you block at the right moment, the action slows for a brief moment, signaling a counter opportunity. It's fun to string moves together into ground pounds, causing monsters to stumble and giving you an opportunity for a killing blow.      Finishing off  larger beasts entails quick-time key presses/thumbstick pushes. The ensuing acrobatics are somewhat dramatic, but the animations aren't smooth and the scale isn't sweeping, which diminishes the impact. While most such games try to make the keys you press somehow relate to your actions onscreen, Garshasp's quick-time events feel removed from the brutal assault you witness. It's also easy to fail the initial key press because the keys you push also correspond to movement control. If you are holding a movement key at the same time you initiate that fatal strike, you are liable to be the victim rather than the executioner. Even beginning one of these events can be a chore. When trying to launch your final attack, you might instead grab thin air, over and over again, because the monster slid into some invisible safe spot that made it immune to your grab.         You aren't always hacking and slashing. Garshasp: The Monster Slayer has a great sense of pace, alternating combat sequences with various jumping bits, some lever pulling, and other brief excursions, such as a moody raft ride through a misty marsh. These sequences, too, are hindered by fundamental flaws. That invisible padding around many objects complicates a conceptually solid sequence in which you leap over branches and spiked poles. Fortunately, it's usually easy to avoid deadly traps, apart from an interlude in which you slide down walls, steering your character and leaping back and forth to evade spinning blades. Garshasp's controls don't always adjust properly to compensate for its camera angles. Consequently, your character doesn't move as you would expect him to in this sequence, which leads to some frustrating trial and error. The game forces few of these annoying wall descents upon you, but none are any fun.      Garshasp's irritations extend beyond the game mechanics. A bug may cause you to get stuck in the geometry after one of the wall-sliding sections. Or the game will deposit you directly into the water after a quick-time event--a game-ending occurrence, given that the hero can't swim. And yet, there's a striking idea in here, struggling to be seen amidst all the faults. Garshasp: The Monster Slayer has the rich atmosphere of a dark fable. The square-jawed lead, the theatrical voice work, and the varied tempo could be those of any big-budget action game--impressive feats for a $19.99 independent release. Nevertheless, that price is attached to a four-hour game that only partially makes good on its potential.    "
3899,Cool Boarders 3,5.0,1,"Cool Boarders 3 is drastically different from its predecessors. And unfortunately for fans of the series, it's not the good kind of different. Sure, it looks a whole lot better and has a ton of tracks and events to try, but the bottom line is that it just isn't much fun to play.  One reason it fails is the game's new control scheme. Even after hours of trying to get used to the control, you'll still be wishing it was set up like Cool Boarders 2. The control doesn't have that precise, in-control feeling when you're executing tricks, although when using the Dual Shock, the analog stick is rather nice to use for basic boarding. The new jump meter is an unnecessary pain and ends up forcing you to play extremely mechanically. You have to press and hold the jump button down at the right moment when you're approaching a jump so the indicator is at the height of the meter when you release the button. While it may not sound too menacing, once you give it a try you'll know just how much of a pain it is. Course quality is another factor that leads to the game's overall lameness. Sure it has 34 tracks, but they're all mostly short and narrow. The developers seem to try to compensate for this by making events like the half pipe best out of three. The new events like boardercross, slalom, and slope style are welcome additions to the game. In addition to the bad control and weak course design, you'll miss the carefree feeling of happily boarding down the mountain. Instead, that's been replaced with Road Rash-style punching on the course. I'm usually all for fighting, but it's so out of place and so poorly implemented that it might as well not even be in the game.  The graphics are Cool Boarders 3's shining moment. The terrain, snow, and trees all look really good. The animation of the different boarders as they elegantly carve down the mountainside, pulling off moves and grabs, is all very fluid. Even the new interface and art look fairly impressive. While the sound effect for the board scraping over patches of ice in the snow is an exceptionally nice effect, the sound and music overall are fair. Unfortunately, Cool Boarders 3 isn't the sequel we had all hoped for - changing developers for this third game really hurt the series a lot."
4608,Sea Life Safari,4.0,0,"  Sea Life Safari tries to bring the thrill of underwater exploration to Xbox Live Arcade but fails miserably. Kids may have a little bit of fun snapping photos of fish, but the game is unattractive, achingly boring, and so preposterously simple that it won't hold anyone's attention for long.      Sea Life Safari's premise is simple: A professor wants you to get in a small submersible and take pictures of sea creatures for him. The submarine follows a predetermined path along the ocean floor, so all you have to do is look around for sea creatures by adjusting your view with the analog stick, zooming with the left trigger, and snapping a picture with the right trigger. Your photos are judged on how well it's centered, how close the sea life is to the camera, and if the subject is facing the camera or not. You throw gizmos (pieces of junk, essentially) toward fish to get them to react, and you get additional points based on how much action is in the shot. The best photos are rated three stars, but the way pictures are scored feels arbitrary. You can keep your favorite pictures in a photo album, but you'll see the same fish so often that there's little reason to revisit old pictures.           The game's five levels take place in a coral reef, a ship graveyard, the deep sea, the ""abyss,"" and an underwater volcano. Each area features 12 creatures to locate and photograph. There are sharks, lion fish, crabs, dolphins, sea horses, an octopus, orca, a number of tropical fish, and more. If you visit a level three times you'll unlock a special item to photograph, and there are also 10 shells scattered through each area that you can collect. That's about all there is to Sea Life Safari--it's little more than an interactive screensaver.     Nearly every aspect of Sea Life Safari has a fatal flaw. The on-rails nature of the gameplay makes exploring impossible. If you want to take a picture of a certain fish that's near the end of a level you have to go through the entire level--there's no way to skip ahead or speed things up. Plain backgrounds, poor textures, and random cartoony animations like fish that dance or burp make it painfully obvious you're playing a video game and not watching real fish. With only 60 kinds of sea life to find, you'll see almost everything the game has to offer in an hour or so, and online leaderboards offer little incentive to return to a level to try for a high score.      The biggest problem with Sea Life Safari is that it's pointless. You can't die, there's no room for creativity, it requires almost no skill, and it's mind-numbingly boring after 20 minutes. The game can't even use the ""it's educational"" excuse because you never learn anything about the creatures you're photographing except for their names. At 800 points ($10), it's a waste of money, too.    "
141,Grounded,8.0,2,"The survival-crafting genre is famous for a few things: steep learning curves, a bit of jank in its systems, and a sense of seriousness that, to be fair, is to be expected in an experience that starts you off hungry, thirsty, cold, and defenseless. Obsidian's Grounded, launching into its 1.0 state after two years in Xbox Game Preview, delightfully rejects these tropes, by and large. Instead, it takes the best bits of these games, polishes them, and offers a childlike spin, giving it all a charming sense of place and a unique point of view.The premise of the game's setup is simple: You take on the role of one of four kids inexplicably shrunken down to the size of an ant and must fend for yourself (and up to three co-op partners) in The Backyard, a typical residential space that would be less than notable if not for your sudden change in stature.In The Backyard, dinner is a tadpole cooked over campfire, or perhaps some gooey ""gnatchos,"" and your biggest concerns are no longer homework and bedtimes, but wolf spiders and bees. It's the sort of thought experiment no one leaves childhood without having dwelled on--what if I was really small?--and as such, the game filters every weapon, potion, safe haven, and more through the eyes of its kids.This doesn't directly make combat easier or base-building less time-consuming, but indirectly, it feels like absorbing the game's codex to the extent that you always know what you should be doing. Combined with the game's steady progression toward making your character formidable in their own right, Grounded is certainly one of the more welcoming games of its type.Because of the game's '90s sci-fi overtones--your sudden status as a miniscule pre-teen is the result of an experiment you'll uncover as the story progresses--there are many field stations set up around the dense backyard which you can use to study materials such as plant fibers, spider legs, and dandelion stems. As you study them, you'll discover all you need to know about the item, including the crafting recipes that demand it.This helps lift up Grounded in those critical first few sessions, because though you still won't have much of what you need to craft some of the more elaborate items, you'll discover them--and thus understand their place in the world--much sooner than games like this tend to allow. This starts to explain The Backyard at a much more welcoming pace than I've gotten used to by playing similar games over the years.The early hours are still tough though, especially when played solo. Most encounters and even non-combative activities seem designed for multiple players. Taking on an orb weaver spider within the first hour is a death sentence for you, but more manageable with a few friends. Similarly, building a really elaborate home base takes a lot of assembly line-like maneuvering, like lugging grass planks from the wilds back to home. Each additional set of hands makes the game more enjoyable, which is usually the case when co-op is an option, but also more digestible.Much of the story is doled out through audio logs and the occasional cutscene, but the characters routinely comment on things as you're exploring, like how the weevils, with their hose-like noses, sound like they're congested, or how they've always been taught not to waste food. These are kids experiencing some incredible circumstances, but they still manage to behave and talk like kids. They'll explore landmarks unique to their world too, like discarded hot dogs, spilled-over juice boxes, and ant hills full of secret passageways.Buff-giving potions are smoothies, furniture includes things like a big squishy couch made of blueberries; everything in the world clearly comes from the mind of a child. The kids' perspective may be dramatically shifted, but they don't lose their youthful eye for the world, and this aesthetic difference is Grounded's greatest attribute. The colors pop off the screen like a modern Disney movie, and even the game's most dangerous enemies have a cartoonishness about them. This is not the sort of dark and dire survival-crafting game you may be used to. If Minecraft is a game for kids with the mind of an adult, Grounded is a game for adults with the heart of a child.That's meant as a compliment, but it does also start to explain one of the game's downsides: Though the crafting menu is impressive in size, especially its complete weapons list that includes different dozens of bludgeons, swords, bows, and bombs, some parts of the crafting menu feel noticeably sparse. I played much of this game within the survival mode where all threats are real, but I did find myself enjoying the freedom of creative mode and its instantly-unlocked recipes, which becomes the post-game's main draw after the story is concluded. Seeing all the game's possibilities in one place made me realize that, beyond a few clever furnishings and several critical crafting objects like the workbench, the game doesn't have a ton of things to decorate your home with.This isn't The Sims, of course, but in every category except for its interior decor, the base-building menu is robust. If you need protection, Grounded's weapons locker and defensive blueprints are awesome. If you're craving fashion over function, however, Grounded is more than a few cool chairs and dressers short of the world's smallest IKEA.If its whimsical aesthetic is its greatest feat, Grounded's level of polish is its biggest surprise. In my experience, survival-crafting games are more prone to messiness than most other genres. Maybe it's the ample tools players are given to reshape their world, or the trend that demands so many of these games launch in early access, thus giving players a jankier experience more of the time, but I went into Grounded expecting to live with some of that messiness, but didn't really find much of it.Combat feels good in first- or third-person, platforming can be a bit imprecise at times due to how floaty it is, but for the most part, Grounded seems to enjoy its status as both a game that comes in a long lineage of like-minded experiences and the latest project from an established, expert team like Obsidian. This is fortunate too, because the game's many traversal elements--from floating to earth on a dandelion stem, to parkouring across bent-over grass and exploring the depths of the koi pond--require some polish that ensure your mistakes are your own, not the game's. With the exception of some missed leaps across tree branches, I never had any issues with the game's controls and its overall feel.Grounded isn't the biggest game of its kind, and most of its moment-to-moment gameplay moments have been seen before in other games. Still, the fantastical setup makes for an immediately intriguing setup, and to further stylize it as a uniquely child-like adventure, polish it beyond most of its peers, and set it in a world full of familiar sights to see in startling new ways makes Grounded no small feat."
3581,AMF Bowling 2004,5.0,1," Bowling games generally fall into one of two categories: intensely simulation based or completely off the wall and wacky. AMF Bowling 2004, one of the only bowling games to feature the official AMF license, falls squarely into the simulation-minded group, focusing entirely on realistic bowling mechanics and little else. Unfortunately, despite its earnest attempt at realism, the game's clunky, overly convoluted interface, general lack of gameplay variety, and incredibly stripped-down presentational aspects leave it dull, confusing, and generally not much fun to play.      AMF Bowling 2004's basic gameplay relies on a meter that appears in the lower left corner of the screen. This meter by itself determines the power, speed, and spin of your roll. To activate the meter, you press the A button once, which will send the meter upward. Hitting the A button again between the initial spot on the meter and the top of the meter will determine the power behind your roll. Once you've selected the power, the meter will then shoot downward, and hitting A again will decide how accurate your roll is, depending on how close you get to the correct spot for the most accurate roll. Once that's set, you determine how much spin you put on the ball as the meter goes up once more. Spin direction is dependent on whether your bowler is right- or left-handed, so that must be taken into account when applying spin. The meter itself definitely takes some getting used to, as the timing required to set up the right throw is extremely precise.    Other factors play into a throw besides the basic meter. You can position your bowler anywhere along the line, and you can set an aiming mark before you throw by moving the left thumbstick around to the desired spot. The oil pattern of a lane can also be determined by pressing the X button before a throw, and this pattern will also determine how your ball rolls down the lane. When you put all of these various mechanics together, you'll actually find the game to be quite realistic in its delivery, but realism aside, it still isn't much fun. Though it's still entirely possible to screw up a throw even after you've gotten accustomed to the game's throw meter, after a while, your first throw becomes little more than a repetitive exercise. It does get a bit more interesting trying to set up for split shots and particularly off-kilter spares, but only a bit. Also, elements like oil patterns and aiming marks may be true to life, but they aren't exactly intuitive to a casual bowler. The game itself never really explains how these elements come into play, and the manual's vague descriptions don't do much to help either.   Another problem is the game's complete and utter lack of variety. There are a few different play types in AMF 2004, but they all revolve around the same basic game of bowling, with no rule variations or anything of the sort. It's 10 frames each and every time out, with all the same scoring rules in every game. The actual list of game modes isn't terribly deep either. You can basically choose from a regular game, a team game, a practice section, or two types of tournaments--one with a qualifying round and one without. The game's multiplayer component is good for up to four players on the same Xbox, but there's no online, and honestly, playing in multiplayer isn't much more entertaining than the single-player game--which is to say, it isn't particularly entertaining at all.      Additionally, AMF Bowling 2004's graphics and sound leave quite a lot to be desired. Ostensibly, there are several different pro bowlers in the game, as well as several different bowling lanes--however, you'll barely notice, since practically all the bowlers and lanes look roughly the same. The bowler models are pretty much a complete joke, with badly shaped bodies and no real detail to speak of, and though they animate reasonably well when throwing the ball, they're still quite stiff overall. The bowling lanes look reasonably decent, showing off some decent light reflection and polish on the lane, and the pin physics look pretty true to life. The remaining set pieces and components are all pretty low-res and generally not nice to look at, though. There are create-a-bowler and create-a-ball functions in the game, but the created bowlers are still generally lacking in variety. There is a pretty decent listing of different ball textures and designs, but most of the designs are rather silly and don't look particularly good on a bowling ball. In terms of sound design, essentially all you get in the game is a slight roster of tacky, 1950s-like rock-'n'-roll tracks that get old quite quickly and the sound of a ball rolling down a lane and crashing into a set of pins, which sounds about as good as you might expect.   Though there aren't any other bowling games currently available for the Xbox, that's hardly enough of an excuse to recommend as dull a product as AMF Bowling 2004. Though it may be mechanically sound, you're far, far more likely to have an enjoyable experience going to an actual bowling alley than spending any time with this game.  "
3742,Stolen (2005),5.0,1,"  Stealth games are somewhat of an anomaly in the video game world. A game about hiding in shadows shouldn't be nearly as exciting as a game about dispatching hordes of enemies with high explosives, or cool-looking blade weapons. Somehow, though, when done well, stealth games can be every bit as intense and satisfying as a good shoot-'em-up. However, due to the nature of the genre, when done poorly, stealth games quickly become a lesson in tedium and frustration. Stolen, the first and last game from developer Blue 52, falls into the latter category, with an undeveloped plot, derivative gameplay, idiotic enemies, and boring presentation.         In Stolen, you play as Anya Romanov, a female thief with no discernable personality and some goofy, glowing glasses. She's supposedly the best thief in the crime-ridden Forge City, and she's in it for the thrill of the heist rather than the financial reward. Anya is backed up by an ex-security officer and tech geek, Louie, who designs all her stealth gear and coaches her during her missions. The game opens with a cutscene of a newscast detailing the upcoming mayoral election in Forge City. You aren't given much more of a backstory, and as you progress through the game you'll briefly meet a few characters and discover the dirty motivations of the one overtly sinister mayoral candidate. None of it matters though, because the story and characters aren't interesting enough to engage you in any way.      Despite the lack of any plot development, you won't have a problem knowing where to go, because the levels are linear and when you come to a new area Louie will chime in to tell you exactly what to do. Usually the objectives consist of simple tasks like stealing a key from a safe in one room to open a door in another room, or hacking a computer to shut down a security grid. There are four levels, but they look so similar they might as well be one. You'll see the same room, hallway, or air duct throughout the entire seven or eight hours it'll take you to complete the game.      The bland environments are made even worse by an abundance of dull textures and unsightly aliasing. Hard edges are horribly jagged, and some of the lighting effects are misplaced. For instance, you'll spend a lot of time hiding in shadows, but the shadows are exaggerated and conveniently placed throughout the levels, whether a light source is present or not. You'll crawl through a brightly lit ventilation duct, only later to be hidden completely in a shadow cast by a small bookshelf in an otherwise bright-as-day room. There is no gradient to the lighting in Stolen; it's either completely dark or completely light. There is even a gauge onscreen to show you just how concealed you are, but it's pointless, because it's either off or on and there's rarely any middle ground.     In addition to the light gauge, you're equipped with a variety of other high-tech tools to help you evade detection by the brain-dead sentries throughout each level. You can use a dart gun to tag guards, shut down security cameras, or to plant decoys. You'll rarely need to use any of it though, because you'll quickly pick apart the guards' patrol patterns and be able to move about easily without being detected. The only difficult part about Stolen is finding the patience to actually remain hidden when it's easier to just charge through the levels. The only penalty for doing so is that the guards will immediately start shooting at you once you're spotted, but you can easily lose them by running through the nearest door. You do have an option to fight the guards, but you can't use lethal force, so you're left with a poorly implemented punch-punch-kick melee combat system that looks and feels ridiculous. Once a guard is knocked out, you have about 30 seconds to hide, hack a computer, crack a safe, or pick a lock before he wakes up. If that isn't enough time, you can beat the guard down again and again to buy yourself time until you're ready to move on.      The one good thing about Stolen is that it offers a decent variety of gameplay, at least until the minigames and diversions begin to look the same. You will often have to pick locks, crack safes, hack computers, and cut through metal panels to access key items or areas. Each time you do this, a simple minigame is initiated. You can make as many attempts as necessary to get through the minigames, but guards continue patrolling while you're completing the challenges, so you'll want to be as quick as possible. In addition to the minigames, there are some platforming challenges where you'll have to jump gaps, swing from poles, run up walls, and perform various other Prince of Persia-inspired feats. The platforming and minigames do break up the monotony of creeping from one shadow to the next, but they're brief, and they only get challenging when you have to wrestle with odd controls or bad camera angles.        Each of the three versions of the game has the same fundamental problems, but the PC version looks and sounds better than the Xbox and PlayStation 2 versions. However, the keyboard controls of the PC are awkward, and some of the minigames are difficult when using directional keys rather than an analog stick. The Xbox version of Stolen is the worst of the three, with frequent loading times that often occur in the midst of gameplay, along with controls that aren't quite as intuitive as they are on the PlayStation 2.      Overall, Stolen just doesn't have much to offer to even the most diehard stealth fans. Once you complete the game there's no reason to ever play it again. There are no difficulty settings or interesting unlockables; there are only a few concept stills you can access by performing well in each level. In the end, Stolen feels like a budget title being sold at full price, and with so many good stealth games already available, there's simply no reason to play this one.    "
3243,Spare Parts,4.0,0,"   In truth, Spare Parts takes its name from the hundreds of ship components and tokens littered across an alien world filled with jungles, mountains, and ancient temples. A pair of potentially lovable automatons named Mar-T and Chip--think WALL-E after a tune-up and long sessions at the robo gym--must use these parts to repair a damaged spaceship (controlled by an affable AI voiced by Simon Pegg). But their efforts are constantly thwarted by the headstrong Lord Krung and his minions. It's enough for a promising start. Mar-T and Chip have a few endearing animations, the minions ooze with diabolical cuteness, and the world is unfailingly colorful and upbeat. Yet the momentum quickly dies. The dry script keeps Pegg from having too much fun with his lines; instead, he often sounds like he's channeling Stephen Fry's narrative performance in Little Big Planet. Mar-T and Chip rarely interact with each other in any memorable way, and they end up having all the personality of a flashy cell phone.        Mar-T and Chip start their journey with some basic attacks that you never really need to improve on, and they scoop up several upgradable gadgets to help them with the many puzzles sprinkled throughout the world. Need to climb a metallic wall or activate a floor panel? Use the metallic boots. Need to smash or move heavy objects? Equip that power arm. Elsewhere, a nanite glove lets our heroes interface with several control panels, and a pair of rocket boots lets them coast over small gaps or set things on fire. These puzzles often appear when you haven't yet received the item required to interact with them, so you can get some replay value out of hunting down missed items. The problem is that it's often impossible to figure out which of these tools you need to use next without resorting to help. That's where the x-scanner comes in, which is a device that highlights an interactive object with a symbol signifying the item you should use on it.      Unfortunately, it doesn't always solve your problems. At worst, it complicates them. At times, the x-scanner shows that you need to move a rock with the power arm, for example, but it may take many frustrating seconds of maneuvering before you get Mar-T or Chip into the inch of space needed to interact with the object. A handful of objects seem like you can't move them until you use the x-scanners on them (even if the needed interaction is patently obvious), and it's unclear if this is a bug or intentional design. This imprecision extends to the platforming itself. The fixed camera makes jumping an ordeal, particularly when you must jump toward or away from the camera, and certain moves (like the familiar double jump and smash combo) often appear to miss their mark. And there's never any real need to use one of the game's myriad offensive combos because simple button mashing will usually get you through most encounters.   Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. Instead, you end up fighting for control of the camera and snoozing through levels that never deviate far from the linear smash-and-collect formula established when you first drop down to a surface. Cooperative play does provide some perks, such as a health boost when both robots double jump at the same time, but Spare Parts never becomes challenging enough to make such moves a necessity.        Still, the boss battles offer a welcome change of pace, though the initial excitement of learning the proper line of attack dwindles once you realize that victory usually requires repeating the same step over and over. One of the simplest boss fights takes ages to complete but only because you must repeat the key step about six times while fighting off hordes of lesser foes. Such lengthy encounters might be forgiven with a limited number of lives or high penalties for failure, but Spare Parts provides Mar-T and Chip with infinite lives, and death only results in a negligible loss of coins and an immediate respawn. Thus, these challenges exchange fun for tedium.     On a technical level, Spare Parts runs fine on both the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 with few differences between the two, although certain textures are slightly crisper on the Xbox 360. (We did, however, experience two lockups on the second boss while playing on the Xbox 360.) But spare yourself the disappointment of playing this underwhelming platformer. As mentioned above, Spare Parts borrows heavily from the Ratchet &amp; Clank series, but the greater focus on melee combat somehow renders Spare Parts infinitely less satisfying. Chip and Mar-T's adventure has little of the lightning-laced action that defines its inspiration and certainly none of its personality. It's a shame because the game's numerous promising elements end up seeming like discarded spare parts from a better whole.    "
3952,Big Mutha Truckers 2,5.0,1,"  On the working scale of completely unnecessary sequels, THQ and developer Eutechnyx's Big Mutha Truckers 2 ranks somewhere between Weekend at Bernie's II and Eddie Murphy's second musical album. The original Big Mutha Truckers wasn't completely without merit, mind you. Designed to be a mixture of silly arcade truck racing and an economy-based trucking simulation, the game just never bothered to lean far enough in one direction or another--not to mention that the game's brand of brain-dead trailer-park humor largely fell flat. So what did the developer do? It dumbed down the simulation aspects, made the driving portions even less fun and more repetitive, and threw in a gaggle of even stupider ethnic and sexual gags. Granted, Big Mutha Truckers 2 is a budget game this time around, but even so, it somehow still manages to feel like a complete waste of time and money.        Big Mutha Truckers 2 revolves around the same slack-jawed cast of characters from the first game. This time around, Ma Jackson, the matriarch of the slovenly and generally unpleasant truckers of which you take control, is in jail for tax evasion. She charges you with the task of raising enough money to buy off the jury selected for her trial. You do so by running from place to place, delivering various forms of cargo, occasionally engaging in lame side missions, and once in a while stopping to listen to some painfully forced stereotype of a character jabber on at you for way beyond what could possibly be considered funny.     The first game had the makings of what could have been a legitimately interesting economy system. Each town had certain needs with regard to what products you could carry, and it was up to you to find the best prices for said cargo and then deliver it to the town with the highest need level to make the most profit. The same basic idea is employed here, but it's been dumbed down to the point where you don't actually have to put much thought into the whole process. All you do is go to a town, hit up the local store, use the handy menu system to see what products are profitable, buy as much as you can, head to the next town, and repeat. The last game required you to periodically shift between tanker trailers, regular trailers, and refrigerated trailers to carry certain products. You can do the same here, but mostly you really don't need to. The profit margins are pretty much the same across the board, so there isn't an awful lot of reason, save for rare instances, where you'd ever need to switch your trailer around. Essentially, you're just on one long fetch quest in Big Mutha Truckers 2.     Periodic side missions break up a bit of the monotony, but they're not often much to get excited about. Usually you're simply charged with having to drive around, collecting items in a set amount of time while piloting some horrifically squirrelly vehicle like an SUV or a pickup truck. The basic mission concepts aren't horrible--you'll pick up a bunch of spilled beer kegs so the rednecks can have their hog-wrasslin' tourney, or you'll pick up a bunch of lost alien delegates for the shadowy G-men that don't want word of their arrival getting around town, for example--but the car controls combined with the infrequent nature of these missions make them far less compelling. Not to mention that during these side missions the game crashed on us at least a couple of times.     When you're actually driving a truck, which is really what you do for the majority of the game, things aren't a lot better. The handling of the trucks throughout the game isn't especially great, and it's not very realistic either. You can't lose your trailer as far as we can tell, and unlike the last game, you don't have to worry about fuel or damage to your truck beyond a single run, as you don't have to maintain either aspect yourself. That's fine, but the driving still feels like too much of a weird mishmash. If you're going to make an arcade trucking game, make the trucks feel legitimately crazy. Just making them kind of fast and weirdly squirrelly isn't a valid solution.     Though the game seems like it would have something of an open-ended feel to it, it really doesn't. You can't really drive around the gameworld outside of specific runs, so all you get to do is plot a course and drive straight through. Sure, there are some shortcuts you can take, and you can engage in some little side ventures, like transporting hobos and smashing up traffic, but most of these little challenges are far more annoying than they are fun. Periodically, bikers will roll up on you and jump onto your trailer, or UFOs will fly up and attack. In both cases, you just have to swerve from side to side until the attackers go away. Why is this fun? All it does is make the process of getting from one place to another that much longer and more obnoxious.      Obnoxious is a good term to describe the entire tone of the game. The game desperately wants to be funny, but in its desperation it simply beats you over the head with its decidedly Larry the Cable Guy-esque sense of humor. A female biker named Slits O'Grady, a lispy, pink-shirted manager of a movie memorabilia store, a hairy-chested Russian in a Hawaiian shirt who loves to chop game with hackneyed American slang, and the in-game subtitle ""Truck Me Harder"" (which, shockingly, doesn't appear on the box) are about as subtle as the game gets. There are a few moments where the game actually manages to provide a laugh or two, but so much of it is so forcefully in your face and hopelessly determined to prove to you just how funny it is that it makes the actual funny parts less so by default. And more often, it simply relies too heavily on tired racial and sexual stereotypes.        The jokes also fall flat because the game doesn't do an especially good job of presenting them. The voice acting isn't awful, but the dialogue just prattles on and on and on, well past where a punch line should have been. Sure, you can give the developer credit for throwing in a lot of voice work, but the concept of ""less is more"" might have been best applied here. Visually, yes, the characters are very goofy-looking, but that's about it. Few, if any, of the visual gags are especially funny, and the actual in-game graphics are pretty low-rent, both when you're driving and when you're talking to people. There are ugly textures, blocky models, and a frame rate that literally falls to single digits on the PlayStation 2 at times--while falling only slightly less on the Xbox.     Not a single aspect of Big Mutha Truckers 2 gives any indication as to why, exactly, a sequel was really warranted. Eutechnyx didn't make the first game better--it just made it dumber. It's not funny, interesting, or particularly fun on any front, and it isn't going to be appealing to anybody without the lowest of lowbrow senses of humor. Unless that's you, your $20 is definitely best spent elsewhere.  "
2919,NBA JAM: On Fire Edition,8.0,2,"NBA Jam was a good game, but not as feature-rich as it could have been. Its brand of over-the-top basketball has been loved by many for decades, but the new inclusions to the series were not universally praised and easily forgotten. One year later, EA has made things right by releasing NBA Jam: On Fire Edition as a downloadable game and offering plenty of content that can be enjoyed either alone or with others. This is what arcade basketball fans have been waiting for.        Taking a cue from last year's NBA Jam, On Fire's Road Trip is the game's primary mode and replaces Remix Tour where you played against all 30 NBA teams in various match types. This time, the matches are broken up by medal statuses, with the first round of matches being classic, two-versus-two games. After winning the first, bronze match against a team, you immediately unlock their silver match; completing that, unlocking gold. Unlike last year where you had to win all of the first round matches against all teams in a particular division to unlock the next set of matches, you can play teams in any order. If you beat the Pacers' bronze match, then you can take on silver and gold matches immediately afterward. Conversely, if you want to jump around the league to mix and match, nothing is stopping you from doing so.     One complaint from last year's Remix Tour was that many half-court or ""specialty"" match types were required to win in order to progress and unlock additional, legendary teams or characters. In On Fire, this has been modified slightly. Yes, some silver and gold match types may still be your classic, two-versus-two matches against legendary players or mascots, but match variations do arise. These include one-quarter matches or games where every basket made has that player stay on fire until the other team scores. These variations certainly open the door to approaching a match differently and selecting specific teams to maximize your chances of victory.     The other mode you're likely to spend a lot of time in is the Online Arena. This mode has seen a number of different improvements over last year's relatively bare-bones offering. Road Trip can be played both locally and online with a friend, but Online Arena matches now give you greater incentive to play, thanks in part to another addition in the game: Jam levels and challenges.     Jam levels and Jam challenges offer an interesting way of tracking your progression while playing. As you reach challenge specific goals--such as scoring points, earning assists, and winning games--you accumulate Jam bucks and increase your Jam level. Later on, those Jam bucks can be spent on additional in-game content. Instead of having to unlock teams, players, and other treats by winning specific games, Jam bucks and your Jam level open the door to unlocking extra content.         NBA Jam is over the top basketball at its finest and that same, wild experience from last year is still on showcase in On Fire. Among the improvements and additions is the inclusion of Tag Mode, which allows you to control both players on a team instead of relying on the AI. This way, any mistake that is made is the player's fault, and it puts more pressure on knowing the right thing to do. To ensure that the non-controlling character still plays his role, the bumper buttons on the controller can issue different commands. On offense and defense, the left bumper has your teammate perform a pick or shove. On offense, the right bumper initiates your teammate to set up for an alley-oop, which is a very important function in On Fire.     Another addition this year is Team On Fires. In previous games, three consecutive baskets made by a player would have that player go on fire, but now, when three consecutive alley-oops are made, your team goes on fire. Team On Fire gives you 20 seconds of possession where both players are capable of doing some fantastic things, and only the passage of time or the opposing team pulling off its own alley-oop can end it. While the Team On Fire is a fantastic addition, it can quickly turn a match into an alley-oop fest, where every player is trying to make every basket as an alley-oop.     The last major addition on the court is the inclusion of razzle-dazzles. Everyone loves to showboat while playing, and razzle-dazzles allow for it. On offense, when holding both triggers, players can pull off one of two types of razzle-dazzles. By pressing the spin/pivot button, players will stop in place and do some sort of funky move to show off. These include doing ""the Dougie,"" yawning, or tying their shoelaces. For those who really want to take it up a notch, doing a razzle-dazzle while attempting a shot can result in some interesting situations, such as taking a granny shot, spinning your arm in a circle before shooting, and even shooting with your back to the basket. Razzle-dazzles are a lot of fun, but doing them too often increases the chance of a turnover or a miss. Also, there aren't many of each type, so you can easily see them all after only playing a few games.        NBA Jam isn't without some faults. Even with a significantly better single-player portion, there are still times when the computer gets lucky far too often or your teammate's AI isn't up to par. As you progress through Road Trip, silver, gold, and even the additional content afterward is downright challenging and frustrating. It's aggravating when the AI can sink baskets with players who shouldn't be capable of certain kinds of shots.      Additional animations and even deeper commentary by legendary NBA Jam announcer Tim Kitzrow are included and add to an overall great package. Those who felt burnt by last year's game can think of NBA Jam: On Fire Edition as EA's way of apologizing for it. For everyone else, this is a fun and frantic arcade game that delivers hours of enjoyment.  "
4874,RoboCop,2.0,0," It's been a very long time since Robocop, Detroit's favorite robotic police officer, has found his way into a video game. Understandably so, since the last Robocop film to hit theaters debuted in 1993, and the franchise hasn't been used much since. In 2001, Titus Software announced it was planning to bring Robocop to the current generation of consoles, though updates following that announcement were sparse at best. Two years later, Robocop has finally made it to the Xbox. The game is a first-person shooter, where you, as Robocop, have to take down the criminal element of Neo-Detroit by blasting your way through every bullet-fodder gang member in sight. Unfortunately, Robocop for the Xbox, despite its lengthy production cycle, has a bevy of horrible problems that render the game practically unplayable.      There are nine basic missions in the game, each with multiple sections. Each mission in the game has one primary objective, a few secondary objectives, and some bonus objectives. The primary objective has to be achieved in order for you to progress, whereas the rest simply factor into your final score at the end of every level. All the missions in the game are actually quite long, but this turns into more of a detriment than a pleasantry as soon as you realize that you are completely unable to save the game at any point during a mission. Saves only take place at the end of each mission, which could have been OK, if the game weren't so mind-bogglingly difficult. Practically every mission in the game takes quite a number of tries to get through, and dying is an incredibly frequent occurrence, almost to the point of inevitability.    How can Robocop be so easy to kill? Partially because every level is completely overloaded with enemies, and Robocop evidently doesn't know how to duck. Every bad guy in the game is armed to the teeth, and though the enemy AI isn't especially adept, they still know how to fire their guns until you're dead, and they absolutely love to do so. Robocop, as you might assume, isn't exactly spry, so he can't just run away when a bad guy is shooting him in the back with a submachine gun. Occasionally you'll find objects to hide behind when things get hot, but more often than not you'll just have to blast your way past every enemy while taking a lot of incoming fire and just hope that there's a power-up somewhere nearby to replenish your health.    Robocop does have a few different weapons at his disposal, such as a machine gun that attaches to his arm, a missile launcher, a grenade launcher, and, of course, his trusty MGC M93R-AP automatic pistol. However, save for the guns that create big explosions, most of them really don't have a whole lot of impact unless you're spot on with headshots. Shooting a bad guy with practically any gun in the game anywhere other than in the face just doesn't lend itself toward a productive result. It can take upward of 9 to 12 non-headshots per enemy to take them down, and considering that ammo is limited, this is extremely irritating. Periodically, enemies will simply give up after taking five or six shots in the chest, so you'll at least save a few bullets in these instances. Adding to the frustration is the fact that the game's auto-targeting system is pretty much broken, and when you couple that with some unwieldy analog controls, you'll find that hitting your target at all, let alone landing multiple shots, is practically an exercise in futility.   Despite the two-year-plus development cycle, Robocop is a buggy mess, filled with loads of unbelievably obvious issues that somehow dodged their way through the QA process. The biggest of these issues involves collision detection, which might as well not even exist half the time. Enemies will frequently just waltz right through walls and not think anything of it. Of course, while their gun is sticking through a wall, they have the ability to shoot you, but if you try to shoot back through the wall, your bullets magically bounce right off. Enemies also have an interesting habit of just totally spazzing out at times, depending on how close or in what position you're standing in relation to them. Sometimes moving too far over from their basic firing range will cause their torsos to start spinning around and around like a demon-possessed whirling dervish, and they won't stop spinning until you move that extra inch over to the right. Also, in practically any mission where you have to rescue hostages, if you wander up to a wall on the opposite side of the room where the hostage is positioned, and you press the ""rescue"" button while facing that wall, you can rescue the hostage without ever having to walk into the room and face any of the bad guys.      When it comes to graphics, Robocop just doesn't look good at all. Every environment in the game is drab, ugly, and extremely poorly textured. Save for a few of the more rare and more difficult baddies, such as the infamous ED-209 and the giant sewer rat that shows up at one point (though we haven't figured out why), the rest of the game's bad guys look like a bunch of Final Fight rejects, with every cheap and generic physical attribute you can think of for a gang member. The Robocop model itself actually looks pretty good, though since the game is a first-person shooter, you rarely ever see it, except in the few cutscenes that present themselves. The game's sound is of even worse quality, especially when it comes to the audio mixing. Much of the cutscene dialogue is extremely quiet, and you'll have to turn up your TV pretty loud to hear what's going on--but moments later you'll be grabbing the remote as the blazingly loud gunshots start going off as the mission begins. Robocop is apparently voiced by whatever developer on the game drew the short straw, and he couldn't muster up even a decent Robocop impression. Additionally, never once does Robocop utter one of his famous one-liners; instead, we're treated to a number of lame exclamations like ""Oh yeah!"" and ""Prepare to meet your maker!"" which sound completely ludicrous coming out of a supposedly emotionless machine.   Every single aspect of Robocop feels like it was thrown together at the last minute, and the end result is a game that, for all intents and purposes, is just no fun at all. Even if you're a fan of the Robocop franchise, you'd be infinitely better off just watching any of the movies (yes, even Robocop 3), rather than paying full retail price for a shoddy product like Robocop for the Xbox.   "
3229,Dungeons,5.0,1,"           If that's not enough to dampen your spirits, then the missions you're given certainly will. Most revolve around carrying out menial tasks that disturb the frightened inhabitants of villages above your dungeon. Whether you're digging up half the map to destroy a set of shelves in a cellar (really) or completing mind-numbing fetch quests where you have to dig for hidden chests of gold, most of the time, you're waiting for your goblin minions to hollow out sections of the map. Even worse is an escort mission, where you have to protect six blobs of slime while they're attacked by a pack of heroes. Not only is it frustrating that you're hopelessly outnumbered, but should a blob of slime be destroyed--or should you actually manage to save one--you also have to wait for 10 minutes before another appears, making the whole thing unbelievably drawn out. Higher ranked dungeon lords, such as the Zombie King and Minos, give you additional tasks, but these only serve to annoy, rather than make use of that downtime. Some of their tasks include sending them your hard-earned gold and soul energy, destroying monsters, or digging out yet more sections of the dungeon, all of which are timed. If you fail to do so in the disproportionately small amount of time you're given, they dispatch a wave of extremely powerful heroes called champions, who often overwhelm and destroy your dungeon heart.       "
1602,Carmageddon: Reincarnation,4.0,0,"Carmageddon, released in 1997, was a bloody and entertaining car combat racer for its time. It was one of those oft-declared “violent games of the ’90s,” featuring enough wanton carnage to attract the ire of hand-wringing parents, politicians, and censors. You raced and killed your way to victory in one of many exaggerated vehicles, each of them strapped with rough blades, spikes, and other nasty parts, as you wrecked opponents and turned mobs of wandering pedestrians into chunks of flayed meat. The game was defined by its era. Carmageddon: Reincarnation attempts to bring that game back to life, but it does little to improve on the old formula, and the result feels out of its time. The game would be mediocre at best, but a host of serious performance issues and slippery controls ultimately leave enjoyment idling in the garage, choking on fumes. Carmageddon: Reincarnation has many problems under the hood, but clunky performance is worst of all. The frame rate struggles to stay around 30, occasionally diving to create something akin to a Red Asphalt slide show; at times, it sputters and chugs worse than a 1970s-era Chevy truck left to rot in the backyard. One map in particular, a small arena with a large metal saucer that periodically drops on any hapless vehicles below, is nearly unplayable. As cars and trucks get crushed, the game screeches to a halt, leaving you to ponder the game’s fragile state and wonder just when it will all fall apart. But you won’t have to wait for long--the game crashes, freezes, and locks up your computer, forcing restarts. Of course, you can lower your graphics settings to squeeze out more frames, but doing so offers no favors in a game that already looks aesthetically dull. The performance, however, would be at least somewhat bearable with vehicles that are fun to drive. Well, buckle up. A host of serious performance issues and slippery controls ultimately leave enjoyment idling in the garage, choking on fumes. You would expect a game entirely focused on vehicles, from racing to combat, to put the utmost care and effort into how well they handle. Carmageddon: Reincarnation, however, could have spent more time under a mechanic’s careful eye--a lot more time. You can unlock a large roster of vehicles--most will be familiar to longtime Carmageddon fans--and send them soaring through frightened crowds of cows and human pedestrians (or peds, as the game refers to them), but precious few are worth taking out for a drive. Some of the heavier vehicles take to the road with the grace of a lobbed brick, but the majority control as though they’re being driven over greased ice. At the slightest provocation, from bump to severed body part, vehicles spin out of control, making you fight to stay on the road. Even a minimal increment, such as diving from road to sidewalk, can cause your car to wildly jerk to the side, or worse, flip end over end. Small ramps also hide untold danger because hitting them at the wrong angle will more often than not send you flipping through the air to land on your roof. Large vehicles with large tires to match tend to have more stability on and off the road, but they lack the speed of the faster, sportier cars. And because most of Reincarnation’s game types favor zippy cars over slow-moving trucks, it’s not likely that you’ll stay behind the wheel of one for long. At the slightest provocation, from bump to severed body part, vehicles spin out of control, making you fight to stay on the road.   Speaking of game modes, let’s go over which ones are good and which ones are bad. Ok, that was a trick statement: none of them are that good. In Classic Carma, you can win in one of three ways: finish a race, kill all the pedestrians, or destroy every opponent. Colored oil drums that dot the map provide you with the means for victory. Red barrels provide weapons and items, including flying Acme-sized anvils, explosive mines, oil slicks, and springs that propel nearby opponents and pedestrians through the air or into walls. Yellow barrels add a few more seconds to a countdown timer or some extra points. Those points can also be used to purchase weapons or defensive boosts, which you can add to a set of hotkeys. The mode takes you on a tour of the maps in Carmageddon: Reincarnation, which are surprisingly large (leading to lengthy load times), providing long, winding races across beaches, through sea towns, under icy caverns, and past industrial complexes. Classic Carma is Reincarnation’s best form. To my surprise, I stumbled into rare moments in which racing along as my opponents and I exchanged metal and flak was actually fun. But these offered short bursts of excitement, and they were dragged down by technical issues and, after a while, boredom. Yes, you can only spend so many hours smashing lazy pedestrians and tumbling onto your roof for the umpteenth time before the game’s cheesy metal soundtrack gets drowned out by your tired sighs. The other modes, many of which are inspired by those from the original Carmageddon, are mostly omissible. Two of them, Checkpoint Stampede and Ped Chase, are practically the same. One has you and your foes drive through a checkpoint, and the other asks you to crush a highlighted pedestrian on one side of a map. In the Car Crusher arena, you must destroy opponents to gain a point, while getting wasted costs you one. Another mode, Death Race, is fairly self-explanatory. Fox ‘n’ Hounds, however, is just bad. In this mode, one player is the fox and is highlighted in blue. To win, you must spend a certain amount of time as the fox while avoiding being touched by other combatants, who otherwise become the new fox. Naturally, you would think that just avoiding enemies would be enough to snag an easy win. But the elementary intelligence powering your foes deflates any fun and challenge the game type could offer. Enemy cars smash into the fox, creating a twisting, writhing clump of metal as the fox title gets passed around so quickly that the game announcer has a hard time keeping up. This is the majority of my experience in Fox ‘n’ Hounds, a mode I eventually avoided like it was an oncoming bus. The frame rate struggles to stay around 30, occasionally diving to create something akin to a Red Asphalt slide show. The game also offers an online mode, in which you can test your ped-crunching skills against actual humans, who are smarter and deadlier than any CPU opponent. Here you are privy to all game modes, save Classic Carma, with the only major change being that resetting your vehicle takes three seconds instead of happening instantly. I didn’t get as many hours into the online portion as I wanted, mainly because I rarely found a game with people to play against. So, with poor performance, stiff controls, and relatively dull game modes, I suppose the only thing Carmageddon: Reincarnation has left to offer is its dazzling sense of humor. Perhaps I have simply grown up, but I no longer chuckle at splattering dumb pedestrians against the hood of a digital car, with heads and viscera flying in all directions. I remember playing the original Carmageddon in my youth, giggling at a flying severed arm or three as I tore down a street. It’s all the same in Reincarnation, and I can’t get over how tame it feels. It’s not just that other games do violence better; this is the game’s humor, and it just doesn’t cause a reaction. During your travels, you will also spot a phallic-shaped building in the distance or hear frightened people screaming on a runaway elevated train as it tears around a city. There are rare chuckles, and I am not completely humorless, so hearing my car squeezing out a mine to the tune of a gurgling fart as it pummels disco-dancing bovines did provide a short laugh. But there isn’t much beyond that. After playing for a few hours, the humor was all but spent, as was much of the game. Carmageddon: Reincarnation has the same flavor as the Carmageddon of yore, but not much attempt has been made at a revolution. It’s the same as it always was, and that isn’t exactly a point in its favor. Mowing down hundreds of the same meandering pedestrians demonstrating the same lousy animations is no longer as fun. Some games today, such as anything from Saints Row, do a much better job at car combat, racing, and killing heaps of pedestrians. Instead, the only thing Reincarnation actually achieves is standing as a reminder of how far gaming has come. The vehicular manslaughter of thousands of listless fodder swiftly falls into tedium after only a handful of hours, long before reaching the end of the game’s surprisingly lengthy 16-chapter campaign. The rose-tinted glasses are off; I was glad to have experienced Carmageddon all those years ago, but that’s where it should have remained.  "
1331,LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens,7.0,2," Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a cultural juggernaut, but it isn't without its detractors. It may be a rollicking adventure, many say, but a lot of it feels like a retread. Characters, locations, and story beats echoed those of the very first Star Wars film, with even the movie's creators acknowledging that there were many (deliberate) similarities between the two.Lego Dimensions was, but it delivers on its core promise of being an engaging, fun, and charming title that's imminently suitable for families. It's also goofy enough for adult fans of Star Wars to get a few giggles out of.Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens follows the plot of the movie closely, allowing you to play through many memorable sections from the film like the desert planet of Jakku, the lush forests of Takodana, the ground (and the skies) of Starkiller Base, and more. You can play as dozens of different characters from this movie and other Star Wars films, but for the bulk of your first run through of the game's story mode, you'll be in charge of key characters from The Force Awakens such as Rey, Finn, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Poe Dameron, and BB-8.Befitting a title aimed at young children, character controls are simple, and with unlimited lives and immediate respawns, there's no real penalty for death. As is standard with the Lego games, many characters have unique abilities which are used to solve puzzles or access specific areas. Rey, for example, can use her staff as a lever to activate some switches, while Chewbacca is armed with explosives that can destroy certain structures.None of it is too challenging; the game specifically tells you which characters to use to overcome obstacles, and even the more obtuse puzzles usually just involve finding the right object in the world to destroy in order to ""build"" a new Lego structure. But the fun--as in previous Lego games--is in the way you'll have to swap between multiple characters to achieve objectives, such as using BB-8 to maneuver a winch whilst regularly swapping out to Finn to build the rails for the winch to run on. Lego games are built for co-op enjoyment, and The Force Awakens is no different. The puzzles are just hard enough that younger players will require adult assistance to solve, making it an ideal game for some outstanding kid/grown-up game sessions.There’s also a new mechanic added to puzzle-solving--the ability to ""choose"" which Lego structures to build (and the order in which to build them) to solve some puzzles--which adds little to the overall experience. Despite the potential for interesting solutions or a greater variety of outcomes, this new mechanic usually just results in different animations that lead to the same conclusion. It's window dressing and adds rather little to the Lego formula.Combat is the weaker half of Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Most enemies in the game can be defeated through simple button-mashing, save for a few bosses that require some loosely timed quick time events to vanquish. There is one new addition to battles here: in some levels, characters can duck behind cover and shoot at enemies (like a Lego version of Gears of War). But the game's concessions to a younger audience make this addition challenge-free. Hitting the left trigger automatically targets an enemy, so there's never any need to actually aim.That formula may be well traveled by now, but it's still a pleasant one to experience, even though a lot of your enjoyment will depend on your affinity for the Star Wars universe (and The Force Awakens in particular). ""Charm"" is a word oft-used to describe the Lego series, and it's still appropriate here. Simple though they might be, I still found delight in many of Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens' levels. It was exciting flying Poe Dameron's X-Wing above the lakes of Takodana and over Starkiller Base's thermal oscillator, dogfighting against waves of TIE fighters amidst chatter from my fellow pilots. I also loved controlling both Rey and the stormtrooper she Force-controlled in the movie to escape her imprisonment from the First Order.And while the goofiness in which the Lego games approach their source material has now become somewhat rote, it still elicited several laughs from me. It was funny to hear some ambient chatter from two stormtroopers about one of them achieving a 3 out of 10 ranking in a recent target practice session (a new record, apparently), and I laughed out loud when Kylo Ren, during that pivotal scene in the snowy forest, bemoans not simply walking over and picking up that fallen lightsaber. Trying to use the Force, he says, was just ""cooler."" And I swear there was a gag directly referencing a ""secret"" cameo within the film (that is, a cinematic spy who played a stormtrooper in The Force Awakens). It's little asides like this that make the game enjoyable for grown-up gamers despite the simplicity of play.There are even several extra levels that expand on the events from the film, including a pre-film timeline rescue of Admiral Ackbar from the First Order's clutches and another detailing exactly how Han Solo and Chewie secured those Rathtars in the first place. For Star Wars fans, these are exciting (and apparently canonical) additions, and it's given more authenticity by the inclusion of nearly the entire cast of The Force Awakens, who recorded new lines of dialogue for the game. It's wonderful if you're a Star Wars completionist, but it's also annoying as these new, non-film levels are hard to access. They're locked away until you earn the requisite number of gold bricks within the game, so you're going to need to play a lot of Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens to experience them all.Playing a lot of Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens won't be a chore, though, especially if you do have a younger partner to take with you on your galactic journey. These Lego games are confectionaries now, little candies that don't have a huge amount of substance but are enjoyable nonetheless. Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens doesn't really take you to a new galaxy far, far away, but it's still a pleasant journey."
528,WHAT THE GOLF?,8.0,2,"What the Golf prides itself in being a golf game for people who don't like golf. Its absolute irreverence means that, for long periods, it only resembles golf in that the controls are similar to other touch-screen golf games, especially Desert Golfing--you aim in a direction, pull your finger back to gauge your distance, and then let go for the swing (although here you're just trying to hit the pin, not land in the hole). But as often as not, you're not actually shooting a golf ball here. Sometimes you're firing off a soccer ball, or hurling a golf club, or an object that's not even golf-adjacent like a rocket that needs guiding through a mess of trees or a crab that must be protected from rising tides. What you're doing changes completely, but the controls, and the humorous sense of surprise, remain unchanged for the majority of the game.Often, the first shot on any course is a punchline. On one early level, you go to shoot the ball, but on release, the on-screen golfer gets flung forward instead, rag-dolling towards the green. In other instances, the punchline comes at the end of the hole: you'll hit the pin and discover that the whole reason for putting in a level about driving a car was so that they could hit you with the pun 'driving range'. What the Golf is an inventive, charming and funny game, one that speeds through ideas, jokes and oddities at a steady clip so that none of its ideas ever have a chance to get old. It's fast, strange and pretty easy--the exact opposite of real golf, and all the better for it.What the Golf's high-concept golf japery isn't trying to deliver a serious or deep experience. Each level is short--getting the ball (or equivalent) to the pin rarely requires more than a few shots, and while the overworld that you navigate through to access each level contains only the mildest of traversal puzzles. The whole point of the game is to make you laugh at how flexible its internal definition of 'golf' is. It's literally a weird flex, but it's more than okay.The game's irreverence for golf doesn't tick over into malice, nor are there any real elements of parody--golf simply provides a rough framework and theme for the game to build on. Levels are divided up by rough themes and concepts: some levels are set in space, for instance, or based on other sports, or require you to switch your phone orientation, switching to a first-person control scheme. Some even bring in augmented reality elements, asking you to move your phone around to fully comprehend a 3D level. The level of creativity on display here is what makes the game so charming, and right up until the end it's still finding new ways to wring joy out of some very simple control mechanics.It's literally a weird flex, but it's more than okay.Unfortunately, if you're playing on PC, some of these fun gimmicks have been excised or cut back--this is a game clearly designed with mobile devices in mind. It's also not as intuitive to control, as moving a mouse is not as immediate or satisfying as using a finger, especially in levels that require you to take numerous shots in quick succession. But the game remains very funny, no matter how you play it. To explain too many of the game's gags would dilute their power, but it does a very good job of baking the comedy into the mechanics. What the Golf repeats the same basic gags often to great success--a favourite is when you think you're controlling the ball, but when you take your shot some other object gets propelled, which is somehow funny every single time. Even the soundtrack, which is largely made up of discordant tunes and singers singing ""what the hell"" and ""golf"" repeatedly, is funny.The game is at its most fun the more recognisably connected to golf it is, although that doesn't mean that all the best levels have you shooting a ball at a pin. The game turns into a spot-on homage to Superhot for a few levels, for instance, where you pick up new clubs to fire balls at enemies who only move--and shoot--when you do. It's a committed homage, right down to the “SUPER. PUTT.” voiceover after you complete each level. There are other direct game parodies in here (and even one challenge that feels like a direct homage to Untitled Goose Game), and most of them are a delight. At a few other points, though, the game stumbles somewhat--some levels have so little to do with golf that the game's central joke feels briefly abandoned, and it would be nice to have a few more levels that required some outside-the-box thinking. Even with all the zaniness, a lot of the gameplay boils down to simply pointing at the pin and firing, and some more puzzle-based levels would not have gone amiss.Thankfully, the two extra challenges holes attached to each level do a lot to flesh the game out. You can finish What the Golf in about two hours, but it's worth going back and trying to 100% it (which can still be done in about six hours). These extra levels are a 'par' challenge, and then another level that usually provides a significant shake-up, one that's often unrecognisable from the hole's first challenge. Often there will be new gags or ideas to enjoy tucked away in these challenges, so it's worth going back for them.What the Golf is a comedy game first and foremost, and it succeeds at its primary goal. Perhaps the game's most telling feature is the 'Show To A Friend' option on the main menu, which runs you through a quick playable ""best of"" reel of some clever challenges the game offers up. What the Golf is an experience that can be shown off, fully understood, and effectively sold to a player in the span of about two minutes--and like all great jokes, you'll want to share it."
70,Horizon Forbidden West,7.0,2,"Horizon Forbidden West was too big. I enjoyed the game overall, but my main takeaway from the experience was that it was entirely too much of a good thing. At a certain point the open world just felt overwhelming, and as a result the sprawling story began to lose its punch. Burning Shores, the first and only announced major expansion to Forbidden West, takes place in an entirely new area with a narrowed focus that hits the spot for Horizon fans, while introducing a handful of creative new mechanics and weaving in intriguing plot threads to pay off in the future.Unlike the Frozen Wilds, the major expansion to the first game, Burning Shores is explicitly an epilogue to the main campaign, not a side story. It picks up exactly where the cliffhanger ending left off, and it heavily references a mount you only received near the very end of the campaign.Spoilers for Horizon Forbidden West follow. This placement after the campaign makes it a special treat for fans who have seen their way through, but anyone else will have their access gated behind finishing an already substantial game. As someone who finished the main game nearly a year ago, I was eager to have another journey into this world I loved. If it had come as soon as I finished the campaign, I probably would have felt too fatigued.Guerrilla couldn't have predicted the death of actor Lance Reddick, who provided the voice and likeness of the cunning Sylens, so his appearance here is bittersweet. Sylens bookends the experience--both pointing Aloy in the direction of her new quest at the beginning, and stage-setting their next moves at the end. His character even gets an emotional payoff, albeit one that feels like it was written to set up further development in the next game. Still, hearing his inimitable line delivery one more time felt special, knowing that we've lost him.Sylens informs Aloy that after the climactic battle against the Zeniths, one of them is still unaccounted for--a playboy industrialist named Walter Londra, who fled to the area formerly known as Los Angeles, but now simply called the Burning Shores, so Aloy goes to track her new target. Upon getting there, she discovers that he's essentially locked down the area with a deadly tower that prevents her flying mount from approaching, and in the process, stranded a set of Quen marines.The setting in Burning Shores is gorgeous. This is post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, but despite the name Burning Shores, it frequently looks picturesque. The city has largely flooded, leaving pockets of islands and skyscrapers jutting out of the ocean. Higher ground like the Hollywood hills provide larger landmasses, but they all have an overgrown, nature-reclaimed look to them. It's unique and eerily beautiful, which describes many of Horizon's settings, but especially when applied to familiar territories like LA.Aside from Londra, the major new character addition in Burning Shores is Seyka, a Quen marine who is somewhat of an outcast from her own military. Aloy sees some of herself in Seyka, as a determined woman who has been shunned by her tribe, and their developing friendship is a major throughline of the story. That especially comes into play as the two investigate Londra, with the sharp-eyed Seyka realizing there must be some reason he's so desperate to get off-planet, and Aloy increasingly straining to avoid telling her about Nemesis. Since all of Aloy's allies learned about the impending threat alongside her, this dynamic of information asymmetry is new and adds a wrinkle to their relationship.Since Burning Shores follows after the main campaign, Guerrilla can count on you to have all of Aloy's tools at her disposal. This is nice, though I'll admit that after such a long absence I had forgotten about some of them. The game helpfully prompted me to use some less-common tools like the Pullcaster when needed, which I appreciated because otherwise I'd be staring at a wall, wondering what I'm supposed to do. There's also one significant new traversal tool--a machine that fires metal posts into a wall to create your own handholds for climbing--but this is limited to a single mission.For the most part, Burning Shores is familiar--you fight machines, you traverse and climb, and then you do it again. There are new weapons and armor available from the Quen at their shops, which require trading a rare new resource. And as you progress through the campaign, you do get an entirely new weapon type, finally borrowing tech from the Zeniths, which feels significantly different and more powerful than any other weapons across both games. There are only a few new machines to hunt, including the tiny swarming Stingspawn and the massive toad-like Bilegut. The only other standard machine, the Waterwing, is extremely similar to the existing Sunwing. Still, if you're looking for more opportunity to hunt down resources and pick apart robots, this will keep you occupied.Londra isn't unique as a villain. All of the Zeniths have essentially been narcissistic sociopaths who look down on the surviving tribal populations as lesser beings. Londra does take this mindset to uniquely horrible lengths, though, which provides ample motivation to take him down. The battle against him culminates in a setpiece so grandiose that the ending of Forbidden West feels humble by comparison. It's difficult and thrilling, and serves as a showpiece both graphically and mechanically.With Londra resolved, Burning Shores turns to addressing the burgeoning relationship between Aloy and Seyka. At roughly 8-10 hours, I was skeptical that a new character introduced in the DLC would have enough time to develop emotional resonance, but it pays off believably and beautifully. This is mostly due to the performances, especially Ashly Burch as Aloy, whose expressions show a shocking amount of wordless emotions as she recognizes and sorts through her feelings. That said, it leaves on a sweet but slightly melancholy note.That's because, as always, Aloy is looking to the future. Horizon: Burning Shores lays even more groundwork for the future of the franchise than Forbidden West, which had already signaled a clear direction for the next entry. It does this in a tight, engaging little package that reignited my love for the world and its characters without feeling burdened by it. While much of Burning Shores feels familiar, it's a sweet, condensed experience that captures what makes Horizon games great. After feeling more exhausted than excited at the end of Forbidden West, I'm glad for the reminder."
2690,Kid Icarus: Uprising,8.0,2,"   Star Fox. It also leads to some rather amusing exchanges between the two.     Uprising is a genuinely funny, wonderfully written game. Constantly self-aware and never afraid to break the fourth wall, the script delivers cheesy lines with a knowing wink, and frequently a sarcastic follow-up. Voice acting is pitch-perfect, and the comedy skits that play out over the action are a perfect complement for the colourful, surreal art direction. It's rare to find a game that's consistently laugh-out-loud funny, but here Kid Icarus doesn't miss a beat, warping Greek mythology for comic effect as well as throwing in a host of Nintendo references, all of which would be a shame to ruin beforehand. The action is complemented by a jaunty original score alongside frequent nods to the original's still catchy soundtrack.        The game's a high-score shooter at its core, and in the air-based sections, it's a wonderful experience from the off. Pit is on a set path, but you can move him around the screen to dodge enemy fire. A reticle floats ahead of him, controlled by either the stylus or the face buttons, and this is used to target enemies while the left shoulder button fires. It's simple, rewarding fun, made all the more interesting by the visual spectacles in the background. Pit darts over cities and through volcanoes, and even takes a trip into space. Weaving through the air and picking off enemies as a giant spaceship fires lasers at you is genuinely exciting. It's when Pit takes to the ground that things can be a little more awkward, at least at first.      During the ground-based levels, you're directly in control of Pit, guiding him around areas and taking on enemies head-to-head. Here, the stylus controls come undone somewhat. The stylus is a bit cumbersome for 360-degree aiming, and the 3DS hardware isn't well designed for being held in the required position for any length of time. The game comes packed in with a plastic stand, but in a lot of situations that isn't ideal. Fortunately, the controls are customizable (going so far as to offer left-handed circle pad support if you own the Circle Pad Pro add-on, although it should be noted that there's no twin-stick control option). The best option is to use the face buttons to control the reticle while Pit is on the ground, although it's worth experimenting to find a control method that suits you. At first, the button aiming takes some getting used to, but once you up the sensitivity and play around with the various auto-aim options and movement controls, things start to click. There's no denying that it's a significant early hurdle, but once you get to grips with everything, it all starts to feel natural.        These ground sections require Pit to push through an area to reach a boss. Normally this involves taking on waves of enemies, picking them out of the sky with a variety of ranged weapons, or moving in close for some melee action. Different enemies require different strategies; there are armoured enemies who can be attacked only from behind, enemies with weak spots who need to be picked off, and some enemies who must be avoided altogether. There are also a few vehicle sections, with a rapid-firing mech providing the highlight. These ground sections are more thoughtful, complicated affairs than their aerial counterparts, and most of the time the two styles work together beautifully.      Occasionally, though, the design of the ground sections can prove to be problematic. A few take place on thin, treacherous platforms, and Pit's propensity for dashing often leads to an unwanted fall. The Circle Pad isn't accurate enough to avoid the occasional accidental dash (achieved by tapping a direction), and since a fall takes off precious health, this can be an annoyance.        Most of the time, however, the game is sensible enough to avoid these mistakes and instead focuses on its versatile combat system. Dashing and firing lets off a powerful shot, while rapid fire can be achieved by holding down the shoulder button. Get in close, and you can whack enemies with a melee attack. There are nine weapon classes, each featuring a bunch of weapons. Cannons, for instance, offer slow but powerful long-ranged shots, while clubs let you deflect shots back at your opponents and deliver devastating close-range blows. Other types range from blades and staffs to claws and bows. Each weapon has its own stats and buffs, and you can spend a lot of time customizing your loadout.        Customization is helped, in part, by the fusion system. Weapons can be fused together to create new, more powerful weapons, and this aspect of Uprising alone adds a great amount of depth. With the aid of a simple grid, you can view the results of possible weapon fusions and decide which to sacrifice to create something new. Your gear section lets you test out any owned weapon on a practice range, and there's a lot of fun in finding the perfect weapons to suit your playing style. You can also convert weapons into gems, which can be traded to other players via StreetPass, allowing them to either claim the weapon, fuse the gem with a weapon of their own, or sell the gem.      You purchase new weapons with hearts, the in-game currency, and then take them into battle or merge them with existing arms. Hearts can be earned from defeating enemies in-game or wagered at the start of each level. There's a difficulty slider which lets you either spend hearts to lower the difficulty or gamble hearts to increase it. The risk/reward aspect is a neat system that gives plenty of incentive to replay levels. So too does the challenge aspect, in which you earn hearts, weapons, and powers by completing goals outlined on a puzzle board. Powers also form part of Pit's arsenal. These range from support abilities like healing and a high jump, to offensive powers like meteor strikes and giant lasers. Each power has a corresponding shape, not unlike Tetris pieces, and you equip them for battle by placing them on a grid, which in itself is a fun spacial management minigame.        The versus multiplayer is playable either online or locally, and these ground-based modes let you take your hard-earned weapons and powers into battle, either in teams or in a free-for-all. Free-for-all features up to six players going head-to-head trying to kill one another. Play takes place across a variety of arena-based stages, providing a solid deathmatch experience, albeit one that won't capture your attention for too long.      Light vs. Dark, the team-based mode, is the more interesting of the two modes. Here, teams kill each other until one team's life gauge depletes, at which point the player who died last transforms into an angel, either Pit or his Dark counterpart. Then it's a case of protecting your angel while trying to deplete the other team's life gauge, to trigger its angel and defeat it. It's a simple mode, and the faster pace of the multiplayer combined with the ground controls means it lacks some of the finesse of the single-player campaign. It's an enjoyable way to show off your weapons and is good fun with friends, but the real meat of Uprising is in its single-player story mode.        When it hits its stride, Uprising is a huge amount of fun. Once you get over the initial control discomfort, there's a deep and satisfying shooter to be found here. There's still the occasional maneuverability foible, but once you get to grips with a control scheme that suits you, these are few and far between. It's one of the best-looking 3DS games to date, with some fantastic 3D visuals that are used particularly well to convey depth in the flight sequences. Endearing, enjoyable, and brimming with content, Kid Icarus: Uprising is a loving homage to Nintendo's heritage.     "
527,WHAT THE GOLF?,9.0,2,"What the Golf, 2019's hilarious anti-golf golf game, is at its best on Switch. Everything that was good in the Apple Arcade and PC versions, which we reviewed last year, remains good here, but the additions and improvements that the Switch version brings make it the definitive What the Golf experience.The game arrives on Nintendo's hybrid console with a new two-player ""Party Mode"" that wasn't included in the PC or Apple Arcade releases. This mode, which sees you and another player each picking up a Joy-Con and facing off in a series of competitive levels, is an absolute hoot. Both players are made to compete across 11 random levels, each based on levels from the campaign, to see who can get to the hole first. There's a great diversity across Party Mode's levels, with some levels feeling more like puzzles, some purely based on skill, and others that could only work in multiplayer, like when you're both controlling separate items that are tethered to each other or trying to goad the other into tipping over a tower of boxes that the pin is sitting atop. There are lots of levels here, and I still saw new ones pop up after playing for several hours.In keeping with What the Golf's style, very few of Party Mode's levels really feel like golf, which is part of the fun. After you've played through 11 stages, you and your opponent compete in one final competitive arena-based game, and the number of lives each of you has depends on how well you did in previous rounds. There are only three types of final competition, but they're all fun, particularly the combat-based game where you fling around in an office chair, trying to pick up and fire explosive beach balls at your opponent. Your victory depends on how you perform in this final game, and how many lives you have--if you won seven of the previous rounds, you can take up to six hits in the final competition, whereas your opponent can only survive three. A full round of games in Party Mode rarely takes more than 10 minutes, and you only ever need the analog stick and the A button. These are less mini-games, more micro-games, often lasting just a few wild, hilarious seconds.As an extension of What the Golf's brand of irreverence and comedy, Party Mode is wonderful. It's also hugely accessible--I jumped in with my partner, who is not a big gamer and never played the campaign, and it didn't take long for her to start collecting wins. Granted, it's not the most balanced experience (one player will start some games with a slight advantage), and it would be nice to be able to toggle certain levels on or off--over time we've learned the tricks to overcome the levels that initially caused frustration. One level also seems to award the win to the wrong player consistently, but it's unclear whether that's an error or the game trolling players as it tends to do. Yet every time we've sat down for a quick session it has turned into multiple rounds, with lots of swearing, shouting, and laughing. It's rare for competitive party games to be built specifically as two-player experiences, and What the Golf is great for forming an intense rivalry with another person.The single-player campaign is essentially unchanged from previous versions, at least in terms of levels and layouts, but playing on Switch gives you some extra control options and a few bells and whistles. Players now have the option to use either a controller or the touchscreen, and if you're playing in handheld mode you can switch seamlessly at any time. You can play through the full game docked, but a few levels that use first-person motion controls will prompt you with a recommendation that you switch to handheld for the best experience--these are also the only levels that require you to have the Joy-Cons connected. I found that I preferred a docked experience for party mode and undocked for the campaign.While initially I wanted to only use the touchscreen controls, touching the screen and swiping to determine the direction and power of my shot, the more I played, the more often I found myself switching to traditional controls if they suited a level. It's not that the touch controls don't work well--they're responsive and feel natural--but it's nice to have options. You can change at any time without needing to enter a menu or toggle anything--touch the stick or the screen and the game will immediately switch control schemes. The game supports every configuration of controller the Switch supports, and it's clear that a lot of care has gone into making this feel like a game that was made with Nintendo's platform in mind. HD Rumble adds an extra layer to the experience, too--while it's used fairly sparingly, the little rumble that kicks in whenever you hit the pin is just right and makes completing a challenge all the more satisfying.As an extension of What the Golf's brand of irreverence and comedy, Party Mode is wonderful.All of these extra touches have made replaying the campaign a pleasure, and I found myself more inclined to dig into the extra optional challenges on each hole, switching between touch and stick control methods to see which ones best suited each. There are occasional frame rate stutters and some slight visual glitches in this version, but nothing that impacts the experience in a meaningful way."
4536,Splashdown: Rides Gone Wild,4.0,0,"  When a game crashes while displaying its help file, that's rarely a good sign. When a Jet Ski racing game lets you completely ignore the track boundaries, that's no indication of quality either. The challenge of Splashdown: Rides Gone Wild isn't in beating your hapless artificially intelligent opponents, it's in discerning which ""features"" are the products of bad game design and which are just bugs.        In Splashdown, you enter your name and choose one of three characters. You'll compete against the other two characters in two modes: freestyle and circuit. These game types are both problematic, and they aren't terribly interesting.     Freestyle mode puts you in a cordoned-off area with several identical ramps. It's your job to perform a number of uninteresting midair stunts (by tapping on the control pad) before your allotted time elapses. You can't perform any flips or spins and are limited to furiously waving your limbs to perform Splashdown favorites, like the ""Get Up Dude"" or the ""Flying Squid."" Your score is then compared to those of your opponents, whose runs occurred parallel to your own. When you finish a run, just select ""Next Track"" to compete on a virtually identical course.      Circuit mode is completely and unequivocally broken. Here, you can simply drive through the course boundaries, taking shortcuts to which your opponents aren't privy.  You can literally drive right through the center of the track, ignoring the boundaries and cutting your lap time in half. It seems that so long as you pass at least one turn marker while on the track, the lap will be counted. You don't seem to be penalized for this practice. In fact, it sometimes scores you points. This isn't detailed in the help file (even when we can keep it from crashing), so it's, frankly, mystifying. Meanwhile, your opponents doggedly stay the course and therefore are never able to give you any challenge.     If you pause the game at any time, you may cause a crash. The longer the game remains paused, the less likely it is to successfully resume. The tension that builds during extended pausings is palpable. Can you head to the bathroom? Who knows! You may not be able to resume your jet-skiing career afterward.     Splashdown's physics are unrealistic, so you can spin your craft in tight circles regardless of your speed. Although it's possible to ease off the throttle, we didn't figure this out until hours into our play experience. Consequently, it's really unnecessary to go at less than top speed.     In fact, the best thing that can be said about Splashdown is that it runs very quickly. You can cheat in circuit mode at a very respectable clip. The riders themselves don't look so hot on the LG VX8000, but at least they animate smoothly. The water, though, is completely stationary, which doesn't exactly foster a sense of realism. The riders also bump into one another constantly, which causes an animation bug that makes them look like they're jittering anxiously. Indeed, their rides go wild.        Splashdown's audio is barely worth mentioning. If you enable it, you'll hear what sounds like experimental harpsichord music. This thankfully only plays over the main menu. In-game, you'll only hear a single sound, which is triggered whenever you score points.     Splashdown: Rides Gone Wild is one of the worst racing games available on mobile phones, and isn't worthy of being associated with THQ's fun PS2 game of the same name. Splashdown is one of those rare games that is flawed both by design and by execution. Even if its litany of bugs were fixed, this would still be an unimaginative racer of which players will quickly tire.   "
3530,Runaway: A Twist of Fate,6.0,1,"   Runaway: The Dream of the Turtle. That game took place on a tropical paradise and ended with an abrupt ""to be continued"" conclusion, while its follow-up begins in New York City with Brian dying in a mental hospital after being convicted of a murder he didn't commit. Other than the characters, nothing directly connects this game to the last one right away. You have to wait until past the midway point before things start to connect, which is frustrating for those who have been following the trials of this pair since 2003 and want a more immediate payoff. The only upside of this fresh start is how it allows newcomers to jump on board with the new game and not feel as if they've missed anything.     The personality of A Twist of Fate follows in the footsteps of the two previous Runaway games. Lush production values remain the highlight. The exaggerated faces and backgrounds gives the game a unique aesthetic which fits in nicely with the cartoonish vibe of the storytelling Nothing is taken seriously, even a supposed murder and time spent locked up in Happy Dale Sanatorium (where the slogan is ""You'd be Mad to Go Elsewhere""). In a game like this, it's perfectly natural for a dimwitted pretty boy like Brian to have wide eyes atop a lantern jaw, for goofy sidekicks to resemble cartoon Steve Buscemis and fat Elvis impersonators, and for the heroine Gina to rock a spunky look with cocked eyebrows and Sophia Loren lips.     Voice acting is equally luxuriant. Every character comes equipped with excellent, if intentionally cheesy, spoken dialogue. But you can have too much of a good thing. Most conversations drag on far too long, forcing you to wade through lots of unnecessary wordplay. Even worse, lines often give center stage to dumb jokes a lot less funny than the writer thought they were. The only real exception is Brian's nutcase buddy Gabbo, who has a lot of funny tics, like how he shouts ""Bananas!"" in the middle of sentences for no reason. Even the music is a strong point, with the tunes perfectly reflecting what's happening on the screen and adding to the interactive-movie atmosphere.     Puzzles are simple point-and-click item collections, resulting in a short game where you do nothing aside from picking up odd bits of rubbish and experiment with this stuff to see how it might solve various dilemmas. Chances are you know this tune very well. In every scene you hit F2 to highlight the hotspots on the screen, and then you pick up whatever you can and go straight to the obvious solution if one presents itself or start playing around until you stumble upon what you need to do.       Just about everything is at least somewhat convoluted, so you do need to use some adventure-game logic. When breaking Brian out of his tomb, for instance, Gina has to go through a crazy sequence of actions, such as flash-freezing a glove and translating an Ikea-esqe coffin assembly manual with the help of a dead Swede (well, actually a crooked medium with a Swedish-English dictionary). So much for just heading down to the local hardware store for a sledgehammer. Still, even though you need to make outlandish leaps of logic, there are few enough items and locations in the game that it's never difficult to figure things out. Trial and error gets you through in a jiffy even when Sherlock-ian deduction fails. And even if you do somehow happen to get really stuck, you can fall back on the in-game hint system (although some of its hints are more cryptic than the actual puzzles they purport to help solve).     Runaway: A Twist of Fate is an adventure for those who just want to enjoy the ride. It's an interesting enough story with likable protagonists and great graphics, even if the dialogue is stretched out beyond all limits of patience at times, but the actual game-playing part of this adventure leaves a lot to be desired. There isn't much challenge, nor is there any innovation over what developers like LucasArts and Sierra were doing well over a decade ago, so what you've got is more of an animated movie than a game.  "
131,Bayonetta 3,9.0,2,"There's nothing more attractive than confidence, and Bayonetta 3 developer PlatinumGames is well aware of it. From the way Bayonetta sashays about the screen--left hand cocked on her hip while the other clutches her gun--to the sheer bombastic nature of the game itself, every part of Bayonetta 3 is unapologetically self-assured. Like the titular witch, Bayonetta 3 feels as if it doesn't much care how it is perceived because it knows its own worth as a game that offers fast and fluid gameplay, jaw-dropping spectacles, comedy, and camp in a way very few others do. And it's hard to argue with that when it's true.Like its predecessors, Bayonetta 3 is spectacular in the truest sense of the word. Though the game's core gameplay is familiar, it ups the stakes, sending players on a multi-dimensional journey across time to save the world. If that's not enough, this venture also comes with full-scale kaiju battles, exhilarating chase sequences, a new, sword-wielding character who is wildly fun to play as, and a series of 2D stealth-based chapters that follow Jeanne as she infiltrates enemy headquarters. All this, paired with the qualities that made Bayonetta 2 so beloved, make for a can't-miss entry in the action games genre.Naturally, it falls upon Bayonetta to put a stop to these plans. Carrying over from the previous games are the basic kick, punch, and shoot abilities, which can be linked together to form complex and visually-delightful combos, as well as both Torture attacks and Climaxes for over-the-top flourishes. Bayonetta also still relies upon perfectly-timed dodges to enter Witch Time, a state in which all enemies are slowed down to a near-halt as Bayonetta rips through their defenses with bullets and beatdowns. Though performing combos (and avoiding taking damage) is still vital to winning battles and earning high-ranking medals, Bayonetta 3 pivots away from the previous games' dependence on weaving together masterful combos to fill your magic meter, instead allowing it to fill throughout combat in order to charge up Bayonetta's show-stopping abilities. Two such abilities are Demon Masquerade and Demon Slave, the former of which allows Bayonetta to take on the form of one of her demons to utilize part of their abilities, while the latter summons an infernal demon you can control in battle through risque dance. This adds an interesting bit of strategy to the action game, as you must ensure your dance is not interrupted by an attack, consider which demon works best in each battle, and manage your magic meter to ensure you're ready to summon a demon when the opportune time presents itself. At times, controlling these demons can be a bit chaotic, particularly the game's new train demon, Wartrain Gouon, which requires you to place down tracks while in battle before it emerges and dishes out massive damage. However, once you slow things down and get deliberate about your movements, they quickly become a blast to use.The same can also be said about combat as a whole. Though Bayonetta 3 accommodates button-mashers, it is lightly punitive to such methods in a way that encourages growth. If you don't make the time to learn how to properly time your attacks, dodges, and use of abilities, the game's increasing difficulty will prove to be too much. Of course you can grind levels and invest in accessories, healing items, and items that grant you upgrades to your health and magic bars to sustain your button-mashing ways, but Bayonetta 3 gives you all the tools you need to learn and succeed the way it's intended, offering up visual cues that instruct you to interact with targets in unique ways and other helpful tips. However, this does not mean there's no room to incorporate your own style.In Bayonetta 3, you can equip two weapons, each with their own unique kit of skills and combos, allowing for you to quickly cycle between them in battle. In fights with large, slow enemies, using a tankier weapon can help Bayonetta take them down quickly. Conversely, high-speed enemies require high-speed attacks, lest you want to spend the bulk of a fight chasing them down and swinging at air. Other weapons, such as my personal favorite, the Ignis Araneae Yo-Yo, excel at keeping you skyborne, which is a helpful skill when fighting enemies that deal close-range damage. Bayonetta can also cycle through three equipped infernal demons, each with their own fighting style. Though Malphas might have a fair bit of dexterity, monstrosities like Gamorrah are powerful yet slow. All this makes for a game that allows you to play how you want to play, which only adds to how powerful you feel while doing it, as well as the game's overall replayability.In addition to standard battles, Bayonetta 3 also boasts stunning cinematic showdowns that feature enemies of staggering proportions and culminate in jaw-dropping moments. From swinging across crumbling buildings as a sort of hellish Spider-Woman to entering spectacular kaiju fights complete with devastating beam attacks, the game is unpredictable and relentlessly exciting. This is all made even better by the fact that Bayonetta 3 ensures the player stays in control throughout most of these sequences when they could just as easily cast that interaction aside in favor of quick time events. I can't think of many action games that feel as frenetic and fun as Bayonetta 3, or play with scale and framing to quite the same effect. Bayonetta 3 does a fantastic job of honoring its titular character with battles every bit as big, bold, and beautiful as her.Outside of combat, the game is similar to previous entries in that it has light open-world sections where Bayonetta can traverse as she seeks out encounters, referred to in the game as verses. The environments range from Tokyo subway stations and collapsing skyscrapers to ancient ruins and historical landmarks, and feature hidden secrets, challenges, and areas where time has been distorted. In each of these zones, you play as a young Bayonetta attempting to rewind or fast-forward time in order to solve a puzzle and progress. While not too profoundly stylized or robust, these areas are enjoyable to search around.However, even with all these abilities, saving the world is a tall task for one witch alone. Fortunately, Bayonetta has two powerful friends eager to lend her a helping hand. The first of these is longtime companion Jeanne, who adds her own unique flavor to the game in the shape of 2D stealth challenges. Though they're fairly simple and short, these challenges are a blast to play and add a sort of campy Katana Zero vibe to the game as Jeanne traverses floors silently, takes down enemies, crawls through ducts, and stumbles into some humorous interactions.Bayonetta also finds help in a young and mysterious katana-wielding woman named Viola. Though Viola might project a devil-may-care attitude as she trudges around in her low-rise plaid pants, knee-high combat boots, and distressed leather jacket, this newcomer is a bit of a softie, a fact Bayonetta has far too much fun with. However, this doesn't mean Viola isn't tough as nails. Equipped with a katana and her own infernal demon called Cheshire, Viola is a fast-paced blast to play as. While she uses the same core mechanics as Bayonetta, there are a few differences between the two, chiefly that you don't have to control Chesire--the cat-like creature is confined in Viola's blade, meaning you simply throw the sword and then bare-knuckle brawl while he is out--and you are able to both block and dodge attacks, though only blocking at precisely the right moment allows you to enter Witch Time. Viola also carries herself quite differently than the graceful, contortionist we know and love. Rather than perform delicate acrobatic movements, Viola moves like a dextrous swordsman, shrouded by a youthful energy that is almost electrifying. Whereas Bayonetta's post-battle screen shows her arching backwards with a knowing smile, Viola's is accompanied by a power chord and punk expression.The dynamic between these three Time Witches is both charming and chaotic, and another high-point in a game full of them. It also reinforces one of the Bayonetta series' most interesting themes: a woman does not necessarily grow more powerful the more masculine she is. Despite Viola being a lot more of a ""tomboy"" than the slender and large-busted Bayonetta, it's made very apparent that Bayonetta is an artist with a gun and someone Viola can learn a lot from on her journey of growth.Bayonetta 3 is a leap forward from 2--particularly in terms of how Bayonetta and the main party look--and it makes good use of the Switch's hardware capabilities. Unfortunately, there are noticeable deficiencies, too, and as newer titles hit current-gen consoles, it becomes increasingly clear that the Switch is struggling to keep up. In the case of Bayonetta 3, this results in often barren locations, and NPCs that look severely outdated. The game does a lot to ensure your eyes are focused on the action, where it looks vibrant with colors and detailed with particle effects. However, allow yourself to look at the background and you'll be met with simple geometry, crude textures, and dull tones. Based on my playthrough, this seems to be a tradeoff that Platinum Games has made to ensure the game runs well regardless of if players are using the Switch in handheld mode or docked, but it's one that comes at a very visible cost.What Bayonetta 3 lacks in visual fidelity, however, it more than makes up for with style. With bright colors and a jazzy feel to the game, it ventures closer to Atlus' prowess with style. The music is also fantastic. From dramatic numbers filled with operatic vocals to the fast-paced pop-punk bops that play when Viola is on the field, the game does not lack in tracks that are just as grand and as energetic as Bayonetta 3 itself.I'm not sure whether it's because of the game's fantastic music, the use of the word ""verse"" to refer to encounters, or her over-the-top style, but when I think of Bayonetta I can't help but imagine her as a popstar. Bayonetta 3 feels like her Las Vegas residency: a lavish and spectacular show where each number is beautifully choreographed, every song is a banger, and the guest appearances are sure to delight. It’s a fast-paced and joyous adventure that achieves its goals with an abundance of charisma and style. While it might have taken the better part of a decade to get here, the queen is back, and she's ready to serve."
1801,Depth,5.0,1,"Left 4 Dead and other titles that utilize the time-tested formula of regular heroes versus stronger boss creatures. Depth takes the action below the sea, pitting a team of four treasure-hunting divers and their underwater drone against two great white sharks out for blood. Several hours of gore-filled amusement ensue, though repetition, bugs, and other nagging issues make Depth end up somewhat waterlogged. But a little sogginess won't stop Depth's team of underwater treasure hunters, despite the danger posed by sharks. As a diver, you and your three allies closely follow robot drone S.T.E.V.E. as it sluggishly moves from area to area, pilfering rusted iron safes for loot. There are no safe rooms offering asylum, and no checkpoints to break up rounds; all five available maps are small, and progression only briefly halts in a room or open area containing a safe--it is where your drone collects gold while your team prepares for the inevitable attack. Treasure found scattered in the environment provides cash to trade for weapons and gear for your team to use in defense. You can toss flares for additional light, or place sonar buoys that highlight incoming threats. But sometimes you can make a bigger statement by planting sea mines to blow attacking sharks into fish sticks. Weapons consist of amphibious rifles and pistols, as well as an assortment of spear guns. You can also fill a weapon slot with other tools such as the DPV (diver propulsion vehicle), which scans for nearby treasure and caches of ammo as it provides a welcome boost in speed, or a net gun that temporarily binds sharks in place. But it's not just the sharks divers have to watch out for; there are plenty of glitches eager to join the fight. Clipping through objects is common, and nothing rips you out of the experience like a large hunk of metal taking up the screen. Treasure also has a nasty habit of clipping through mounds of sediment, buried just deep enough to be out of reach. Even more irritating are computer-controlled sharks that have a bad habit of occasionally clipping through solid walls. Tapping sprint propels you forward in short bursts, though you can only use this ability consecutively about three times, after which you have to wait for a brief period--this must be due to fatigue, but the HUD for the diver doesn't include a stamina meter to display how much energy you can deplete before tiring. Boosts also stop short far too often, freezing you in place even as you hold forward. Getting stuck on walls and other objects is another constant source of annoyance. And to be killed by a shark after getting snagged by a corner or a frayed piece of metal is incredibly frustrating. The other team consists of two speedy sharks, each armed with razor-sharp teeth. Unlike divers, who have the benefit of firepower, playing as a shark means having to use guerilla tactics to plan moves and strike when the moment is right. Attacks are limited to a short lunge and a long dash, and any living thing caught in their jaws is destined to have a bad day. Their attacks are limited to a short lunge and a long dash, and any living thing caught in their jaws is destined to have a bad day. Of course, you will have to suspend some disbelief, as Depth's sharks are able to stop and float in place, as well as swim backwards--both of which are physically impossible for sharks (I don't care what you saw in Deep Blue Sea). Parts of the environment indicated by glowing cracks can be destroyed by ramming into them, creating new openings and opportunities in which to plot your attack; I only wish there was some indication as to how much damage these objects can take, as some will crumble at two hits, others three. More than once I thought a wall would give way after three hits, only to watch as my second strike left me floating in a room looking foolish and surrounded by trigger-happy divers. Playing in third-person as a shark is more difficult than playing as a diver, but practice yields deliciously grisly rewards. As your skills sharpen, it becomes easier to sense the best time to pick a diver out of a room before the other flippered meat-bags figure out what happened. Stalking your prey and setting up an ambush at the opening of a passageway, or diving down on unsuspecting enemies, is absolutely thrilling. Damaging S.T.E.V.E. temporarily stops the drone, giving you time chase down seals to replenish health, or regroup and plan the next attack. Special abilities can be purchased as you rack up kills. Boosting the strength of your ampullae of Lorenzini, for example, allows you detect the kind of equipment the divers are using, and the hammerhead skill can bust down destructible environments faster and put S.T.E.V.E. out of commission for a longer stretch of time. Playing as a shark is just as buggy as a diver, though. It's all too easy to get stuck on corners or objects just as frequently as a diver, if not more so, while aiming the shark is incredibly unintuitive. Often you zip past a diver just barely out of your reach, leaving you to guess where best to direct those gnashing jaws. Depth's distractions are unfortunate, because when the game is running at full performance, it hits all the right emotional notes: The sense of imposing dread as a fleshy diver, and the excitement of the hunt as a bloodthirsty shark. As a diver, your first indication of the growing danger is your heart, which beats harder as a shark draws near. Huddling in a corner, the faint sound of a tail swishing through the water nearby is enough for panic to unsettle any confidence placed in your defenses. Hearing the muffled scream of an ally as a streak of silver whips past to drag him into the gloomy depths in an eruption of bubbles and blood is terrifying, and more than enough to justify any level of galeophobia. Thankfully, the shooting mechanics are solid, and a wide variety of weapons and gear allows you to experiment and customize your diver as you see fit. The same can be said for the sharks, whose special abilities grant the freedom to create the predator of your dreams. I actually found myself leaning toward the shark team the more I played. The dominance you feel as you swim into the open sea with your prize in tow after a successful hunt will leave you shaking with maniacal laughter. But sadly it doesn't take long for that pleasure to fade. In its attempt to mimic the mechanics and design of its famous peer, Depth fails to parallel Left 4 Dead's endurance or charm. The maps include a sunken ship and bleak caverns, but many lack features distinguishing enough to make them truly memorable. Complicating the dilemma is how utterly dark most of the maps are. The grim surroundings go far to offer fearful situations in which a shark could attack from the shadows, but going through multiple sections in levels where only a few shafts of light and a part of a wall are visible makes for a drab experience--one that peaks at around eight hours before becoming dull and repetitive. Don't look to the divers to infuse much-needed color, though; any differences between, say, Alejandro and Marissa stops at disparate model types. Depth also looks incredibly dated; its murky water just barely obscures the low-quality textures, and (even running maximum settings for anti-aliasing) sharp, jagged edges that outline the details of character models and objects threaten to slice straight through the screen. The maps also suffer from some balancing issues. Although a couple of levels are fairly even, savoring both open and enclosed areas, others favor one side or the other. Playing as a shark in a map filled with rooms interconnected by narrow passageways is made even more difficult when you get snagged on the myriad corners preventing you from escaping. Another map ends with a long stretch of open water, barely illuminated beyond the scope of the divers' flashlights. Sonar buoys have a limited range, so creating even a modest guise of security requires that you swim far outside the safety of your team. At that point you might as well hang a sign around your neck that reads ""shark bait."" Jaws on the NES. Future updates that clean up bugs and add new content could help it breach the surface and approach greatness. Until then, however, Depth floats listlessly in the ocean current."
2578,Awesomenauts,8.0,2,"  Multiplayer online battle arena, or MOBA, is a genre of games packed with some heavy hitters in the PC space. Whether it's a legacy game like Dota (or Dota 2) or the ever-expanding League of Legends, there's one thing most MOBAs have in common: an absurdly steep learning curve. Expertise in some MOBAs isn't measured in hours, but in months. It's not exactly a pick-up-and-play genre. Enter Awesomenauts, a colorful 2D MOBA that is approachable for genre newbies but is deep enough to satisfy veterans. On consoles, Awesomenauts had the luxury of being one of only a few MOBA-type games. That's not the case on the PC. It may not be as novel, but the PC version is definitely the best yet. It includes additional characters and some subtle balance tweaks. Also, it still has a French chameleon with a robo-laser sword for an arm, and that ranks pretty high on the awesome scale.       You play as one of eight Awesomenauts (the PC version comes with the two console DLC characters) on a mission to mine solar, a galactic fuel source and currency. Unfortunately, another group of Awesomenauts wants the solar too, and so you must fight to control the precious resource. The premise and plot are as absurd as a monkey with a jetpack, but Awesomenauts isn't about telling a story; it's about battle. You pick your hero, join two others (or AI-controlled bots), and slug it out against another team of three on one of a few symmetrical maps. Your goal isn't to kill other players, but to reach and destroy their solar core. While killing opposing heroes helps, this is not a game of 2D team deathmatch, and playing it as a straight team deathmatch game is a recipe for frustration. Success in Awesomenauts requires teamwork, strategy, and smart upgrade decisions.           Unfortunately, not all of the characters are available up front, which means you need to level up your profile through matches with characters you might not like in the meantime. You can level up in offline practice modes (the only single-player option because there is no campaign mode), but playing against the not-so-smart AI doesn't come close to playing against real people with real strategies. There's a short tutorial in the beginning of the game, but it focuses more on the basic mechanics than it does on how to build a character and a team. It would have been nice to see some character-specific scenarios that offered tips on upgrade selections. Instead, you'll likely learn the hard way, by coming across nearly unbeatable combos--like a fully upgraded Voltar and Clunk.          A knowledgeable, synchronized team of Awesomenauts is a thing of beauty. There's a camaraderie that blossoms when you successfully use your character's strengths to cover a teammate's weaknesses. You're never an all-star in Awesomenauts, because lone wolves die fast; rather, you're always a team player, doing your part for the success of the group. The focus on an objective and the reliance on others make Awesomenauts feel more like a team sport than a typical frag fest. Once you get on a roll with a team, it's hard to stop. Every match is a new challenge: Will the next team have a better strategy than yours? Does someone have a different build of Lonestar the space cowboy that could best yours? Should you try out that new upgrade you unlocked? The addictive momentum of Awesomenauts is easy to get caught up in.     The 2D presentation is the most obvious departure from the usual MOBA setup, but it's the art style and underlying absurdity that steal the show. Awesomenauts has everything you'd want out of a wacky Saturday-morning cartoon: ridiculous eccentric characters, goofy voice acting, and an enthusiastic theme song, complete with an over-the-top animated intro. The characters are brimming with personality. They're all visually unique and easily identifiable, which is great since things can get hectic on the 2D battlefield. You won't mistake the floating brain creature Voltar for the hip-hop-inspired Froggy G (who might have the best theme music of any hero). The dedication to the Saturday-morning cartoon theme makes it feel like Awesomenauts is based on an actual show, and after spending a few hours with the colorful cast, you might wish it were.        If you've never played a MOBA, Awesomenauts is a great place to start. Grab some friends, take the time to study up on your favorite characters, and you'll have a blast. MOBA pros may enjoy the fresh perspective and the quirky characters too. With more heroes on the way, and a passionate community of fans, Awesomenauts looks like it could get more awesome with time. For just $10, Awesomenauts is a great value, offering a deep, rewarding, and approachable competitive battleground.   "
880,20XX,7.0,2,"But the levels you tackle are where 20XX differs from its inspiration, with obstacles and enemies procedurally strung together. For the most part, this works as intended, with new enemies and hazards progressively introduced with each new stage. A corridor that is usually calm might be riddled with spike traps the next time you enter it, adding new challenges to a previously safe area. Other times the shift can feel unfair, filling the screen with projectiles and moving parts that demand superhuman reflexes with practically no margin of error. These areas can bring the strongest of runs to a grinding halt through no fault of your own, which is incredibly frustrating.Dying is central to progression in 20XX though, so even the most infuriating of deaths have silver linings. During each run you'll accrue Soul Chips, a currency used in 20XX's hub world to purchase permanent upgrades, item unlocks, and single-use buffs. Simple additions to your overall health and special weapon energy are priceless during more difficult later stages, while simple perks such as enemies dropping more health or buffs to overall dash speeds provide welcome twists to the gameplay loop you quickly become familiar with.Additional weapons are also available and are acquired in the same fashion as Mega Man titles: ripped straight from the husks of bosses you defeat. Each boss battle features a central mechanic; a giant mechanical face will employ an impenetrable shield for brief moments during a battle in between flurries of projectile attacks, while a sentient Venus flytrap will lob mortars at you from afar. These and many more abilities can be picked up after each successful victory, or tossed aside for additional life, energy, or run-specific currencies. 20XX forces you to consider what equipment to take and which to leave behind, but it rarely engages you in scenarios where these choices are truly tested.The very same boss fights are a prime example of this failure. A handful of them provide complex strategies for you to overcome, combining a good mix of precise platforming and attack timing to make victories hard fought and rewarding. Others make good use of the rooms they take place in, providing you with alternative means of attack such as exploding platforms that fall after you touch them. But far too many rely on cheap tricks and uninteresting attack loops. The less egregious of these just feel boring, while the worst unsettle the balance of mechanics to a point where you're forced to just accept taking damage in a hurried attempt to finish your foe off as quickly as possible. And with the randomness of potential upgrades strewn across levels thrown into the mix, having a compelling boss fight is a rare occurrence.Despite this, it's hard not to get sucked into taking on multiple runs of 20XX's campaign in the hopes of reaching its conclusion. Each individual run is brief enough to make it a perfect match for a portable console such as the Switch, filling in odd gaps of free time with exciting randomized challenges. Daily and Weekly challenges with their own leaderboards are more competitively focused without shaking up the core loop, aside from giving you access to items you might not have unlocked yet for a useful little test drive. The boss rush mode is equally enticing, despite the inconsistencies with their designs. This mode offers a good way of familiarizing yourself with their mechanics without being caught off-guard during a strong run.20XX isn't just a solo experience, giving you the ability to tackle its campaign with an online partner in tow. Collectible currencies are shared between each player while upgrades are duplicated, presenting you with some opportunities for decision-making but never forcing you into a corner with one player being clearly more valuable than the other. Cooperative play is slightly more chaotic, but having both ranged- and melee-focused characters in a single stage does inject the action with more life, despite the difficulty and complexity of enemies seemingly remaining equal.Procedural generation is sometimes lambasted as a cheap alternative to intricate level design, and 20XX doesn't always do enough to break that stereotype. But despite its inconsistent level make-ups and underwhelming boss designs, 20XX is still an engrossing side-scroller that perfects the feeling of navigating dangerous, pitfall and enemy-filled stages. Nostalgic itches are sometimes tough to scratch with modern reincarnations of older formulas, but 20XX is a satisfying iteration on a fan-favorite formula. Even if the results are mixed, it's easy to appreciate a Mega Man-styled adventure that never has to end."
2783,Choplifter HD,6.0,1,"        Avoiding hostage deaths, taking out foes, and being expeditious in your rescue efforts will net you higher scores and more stars. Your performance post-mission is scored and rated on a five-star scale, and the more stars you gain per mission, the sooner you gain access to upgraded helicopters. Better helicopters grant perks like stronger firepower and armor, as well as room to ferry more hostages at once. Prioritizing your rescue efforts and finding the most efficient pattern to take during a mission is a key consideration, as is reattempting different scenarios to work out the least-hazardous approach in the shortest amount of time. Alongside other factors, such as your ability to boost (at the expense of more fuel consumption) and learning to be conservative with your limited rocket use, the game preserves the distinctly tactical nature of its forebears in spite of its simplicity.        "
3734,Polaris Snocross,5.0,1,"One of the key selling points of Polaris SnoCross is its retail price of less than $20. The first thought that will invariably pop into your mind after hearing that is, ""Finally! An affordable game!"" This thought will be quickly followed by the slightly more cynical, ""If the game were any good, wouldn't they try to charge more for it?"" Well, the second thought proves correct. With this game, you get what you pay for: passable gameplay and graphics but far too little bang for the buck.   This title features ten tracks and 16 sleds, which you can unlock as you complete the tournament mode - the game's meat and potatoes. Rounding out the features are a single-event mode that offers tracks unlocked in the tournament and an instant-action mode that picks a random track and snowmobile.   The gameplay blueprint is as simple as pie: You win races and do preprogrammed tricks (the game offers 16 tricks, which have to be found in the instruction manual and/or through trial and error). In tournament mode, as players progress they unlock more tracks and snowmobiles. By doing tricks and winning races, you earn wrenches to improve your snowmobiles' statistics.   Visually, the game proves to be a pleasant surprise. Admittedly, with any PlayStation racing title you'll see some polygon pop-up, but it isn't really noticeable with this title. The gameplay moves at breakneck speed, especially after you unlock some of the beefed-up snowmobiles. At these high speeds, the fluid frame rates and smooth, responsive controls really deliver that ""whoosh"" feeling of flying through the snow at death-upon-impact velocity. Effects such as snow and night racing look a little on the plain side, but they do the job visually. Aside from the occasional AI/graphics glitch (such as opponents being stuck in midair or banging their sleds against an immovable fence), the game's looks and control [QUERY: controls?]are both solid. In addition, the techno background sounds and minimal audio effects prove generic but at least adequate.   The game's track designs prove to be another worthwhile highlight, especially with the cross-country courses. The tracks have a good deal of ramps to attempt tricks from as well as a great deal of branching paths and hidden shortcuts (such as busting through doors or squeezing through narrow gaps). In the latter stages of the game, these shortcuts are essential to finishing first. In addition, the game offers plenty of obstacles to mow down: fences, signs, boxes, etc. Unfortunately, there are no bonus points awarded for finding/destroying these objects, a feature that might have added replay value.   Two major flaws really drag the game down. First off, it's possible to beat the tournament mode in a single evening - by unlocking all tracks and sleds. Since the game lets you upgrade your sleds after repeated play, any semblance of challenge gets thrown out the window once you unlock the 2001 and the top-secret concept sleds. Secondly, the game's collision system between objects (such as two snowmobilers) is downright goofy. In some cases, you can be in first place, but then a driver who bumps into you from behind sends you flying. The resulting crash can easily move you from first to fourth in a heartbeat. In other cases, computer opponents can literally bump you into a wall - but when you try to do the same to get revenge, you wind up wiping out instead. It seems that upgrading the snowmobiles' stability attribute moderates this problem somewhat, but in essence, these seemingly random collision effects will prove frustrating and cheap - and you'll just have to deal with it.   Most people would rather pay $40 for a more polished, fleshed-out, and challenging version of this title, because it does have potential, especially in a genre with so few entries. For snowmobile fans with a little extra cash to burn, Polaris SnoCross proves to be a rather entertaining diversion as long as you can accept its odd collision glitches. But buyers beware: With a $20 price tag and minimal gameplay challenge, the racing fun might end all too quickly."
3502,Minigore,8.0,2,"  In Minigore, you play as a gruff, blocky character named John Gore. John is wandering through the forest one night when he's suddenly and ruthlessly attacked by an endless horde of baddies. Luckily, John has a gun equipped with unlimited ammo and he can shape-shift into an invincible monster. Does any of this make sense? Well, no…not as such. Should you mind? Not in the least--because this game delivers plenty of fun shooting action.             This review was provided by GameSpot mobile content partner SlideToPlay.com. "
2291,Uncharted 2: Among Thieves,8.0,2,"Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is known for its incredible single-player adventure, but there is still a lot to do when you finish Drake's quest to once again save the world. Fantastic multiplayer modes bring the fast-paced action from the campaign into a competitive setting, paving the way for chaotic matches that continually surprise and entertain. With the latest round of downloadable content, Naughty Dog has added even more ways to enjoy this superb game. Two new maps afford you fresh opportunities to swoop down on your oblivious friends from above, dropkick them in the head, and then clamber up a nearby wall to dodge the rocket screaming right toward you. But the best part of this package is a new cooperative mode in which communication and sharp shooting are critical for staying alive against waves of increasingly tough enemies. There isn't anything monumental to lure lapsed players back into the fold, but for those of you who have never left Drake's side, this offers up plenty more explosive fun.        The brand-new Siege mode is the best part of this expansion. Similar to Survival mode, it pits you and up to two friends against an aggressive force that doesn't care one iota that you're grossly outnumbered and most likely low on ammunition. The goal is to stay alive through 10 waves of enemy attacks, but you're restricted to small territories that are difficult to hold on to. Once all players are stationed inside the zone, a circle slowly fills, counting down the time needed to stay alive before you finish that wave and have to run off to the next section. The basic concept of Siege has been seen before, but there is extra tension involved when you are bound to such a small area. You can't exactly run from a fight when your friends are counting on you to hold down a territory, so you're left searching for every scrap of cover available, blind firing and lobbing grenades with reckless abandon, and doing everything in your power just to stay alive.     The most thrilling aspect of this mode happens when your friends are in need of help. A downed ally can be revived, but risking your own life to save his is a gamble in even the best circumstances. Enemies are all too eager to take advantage of your altruistic nature, and it's a heart-pounding rush to sprint toward your fallen friend and help him to his feet while you simultaneously yell at him for ever leaving cover in the first place. Even more exciting is when your unobservant friend gets caught by a grappler. This sets up a hostage situation in which you have to gun down your armed opponent without accidentally nicking your buddy with a bullet. If your aiming arm is shaky, you can always rush in to help with some timely melee moves, and there's nothing quite like landing a cheap low blow to free your friend from certain death. Siege mode ups the ante every round, rolling out progressively tougher enemies to take you down. If you don't think it sounds difficult to stay alive when you have to deal with a gang of riot-shield soldiers, Gatling-gun monsters, and fiendish snipers, just wait until a helicopter enters the mix.     The two new maps draw on levels from the single-player campaign, giving you a new way to re-create those thrilling set-piece battles. The first is called The Highrise. When Nathan Drake visited this Nepalese city the first time, he leapt out of a building just before it collapsed. Now he has to survive bullets, rockets, and the occasional punch to the head. This level emphasizes your impressive agility, giving you plenty of opportunity to leap between buildings, shimmy up ladders, or hang from ledges to take potshots at your friends. Positioning is the key to victory. You have to constantly weigh the benefits of being on high ground (increased sniping chances) with the obvious disadvantages (everyone will hate you). The most notable aspect of this stage is the environmental danger that crops up at random points during a match. Remember the helicopter that shows up in the single-player adventure? Well, its back, but you won't have a chance to gun it down this time. If you're caught standing on a rooftop when the warning sirens go off, say hello to a missile and good-bye to your life.         The other map is called The Museum. This map draws on the stealthy single-player level it's based on by offering a slower, more thoughtful experience. You are rewarded for keeping a low profile, slinking into and out of shadows, and striking with deadly precision when the opportunity presents itself. Not even the sun can reveal your location here. Dusk has settled in on this cultural institution, creating long shadows that provide a perfect hiding spot for those intent on surprising their foes. The darkness creates the feeling of fear because there are no safe corners to back into, making you constantly scan the environment lest your foes get a drop on you. But that doesn't mean you have to stay quiet and be a silent observer. There are secret passages strewn about the level for sharp-eyed players to find, making it imperative for you to be constantly on the move, hunting your friends before they get to you first.     Clearly, the content available in this pack is great. Plus, in addition to the two new maps and one new cooperative mode, there are six more skins and 11 trophies to strive for. When you combine all these features, there is plenty of content to justify the $5.99 price point.  For those who are still enthralled by Drake's exploits, or if you simply crave an exhilarating cooperative experience, there is a lot of fun to be had in this expansion pack. Siege may deviate only slightly from Survival, but it's so rewarding and challenging that it doesn't matter that it isn't very original. And the maps open up new tactics, offering up unique battlegrounds in which to kill your buddies, archrivals, or just strangers who get in your way. The Siege Expansion gives you another reason to keep playing this excellent game.  "
1075,Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles,6.0,1,"Along the way you'll want to pick up anything not nailed down, so that when you find an NPC with a side quest there's a good chance that you'll already have the things they wanted you to gather (and if not, you'll hopefully have enough to swap with a local merchant--the game has a barter economy). Some of these quests can be quite involved. One late in the game, for instance, asks you to collect a certain item from a cave, but to find that cave you'll need to craft a bomb (it makes sense in context). To get the materials to make that bomb, you'll need to first become a 'brewer', which requires that you head to another part of the map and complete a different quest to open up new crafting options. After that, you'll get the recipe required to create the parts you need in the 'crafting' menu, which tells you exactly what you can build and what you'll need to build it.This is one of the game's more complicated quests, though, and most are far simpler. Yonder is not designed to be challenging. The main quest line is extremely short; tellingly, the trophy awarded to you for completing the final mission is called ""That was easy"". This pace can actually be refreshing, but once that main quest is complete the appeal of having a beautiful island to wander around starts to wane. The side quests aren't necessarily much fun, and the rewards for completing them are often intangible, offering little more than a sense of satisfaction that becomes less satisfying with each new item ticked off your quest list. Search the world high and low, uncovering its secrets, and it will rarely feel like the game world has actually changed in any way that matters, even after you've finished the game. Once you've seen everything and the appeal of exploration wears off, there's little reason to push for 100% completion.There's a farming system, too, which lets you establish farm plots and generate income by housing livestock (if you walk up to an animal while you happen to have its favourite food in stock you'll have the option of feeding it, and after that it's yours). This could be the game's deepest mechanic, but it feels weirdly inconsequential. Farms serve a practical purpose--they let you store resources, which is good when your backpack fills up--but farming is not exactly a deep experience, and it's not going to pull anyone away from Stardew Valley.Yonder is beautiful and relaxing, but only up to a certain point. It's great for the first few hours, wandering around and discovering new sights, but the world ultimately leaves you wanting more depth and personality to explore. The NPCs you encounter aren't fleshed-out characters, and the villages scattered throughout Gemea feel like veneers rather than actual locations--there are no building interiors, and very little sense of the lives being lived within them. Yonder is full of beautiful views, but while a distant mountain might be stunning, after a few hours it's hard to get excited by what might be on the other side of it."
1879,Firefall,5.0,1,"  Borderlands with its trash heap jungle gyms, or Skyrim's mountainsides that have to be scaled with a sort of zigzag humping motion. Like the former game, Firefall confers a floaty, powerful jump (here bolstered with a jetpack), and like the latter, it offers plenty of alluring heights to test it against. Looming crags, giant coral formations, and neo-futurist superstructures litter the horizon, practically begging to be scaled. Of course, Skyrim and Borderlands nestled Easter eggs in the promontories and nooks of their open worlds, items and secrets that acted as an assenting nod to the player's vagabond explorations. By contrast, if you reach the top of a giant mountain in Firefall, or the depths of some strange and glimmering cave, you might find at best a few cast-away assets: a desk, or maybe a crate. As developer nods go, that's almost imperceptible. Halo. The action has that unrehearsed, clumsy manner of games where climbing is included but not quite ""designed."" From the cel-shaded, intermittently quirky cast of quest-givers and their predilection towards remote communication (even when standing next to you), to the lazy twang of the ambient soundtrack, Gearbox's shooter feels just a bit too present. Even the game's mission-giving job board--one of the basest, most ham-handed conventions to be found in modern video games--makes an appearance, playing its usual role of making saving the world feel like punching in at an assembly line job. Grab a ticket, kill [number] of [bandits/wildlife/aliens], report to [location], click on [object], collect [rewards]. Other than shooting, of course, the particulars of your job are dependent upon your selection of battleframe (mechanical exoskeletons are the new future's flying cars), which serves as your traditional MMOG class. I picked the Dreadnaught, the game's euphemism for ""tank,"" but the decision really only amounts to a bit of garnish on the shooting drill all classes partake in: line up the enemy in your crosshairs and press the mouse button until the red bar symbolizing its joie de vivre wanes. Each class gets a smattering of more specific hotkey abilities, but I found myself employing those more out of desire to speed things along than to save my hide. Forget a need to group with other players--there simply isn't enough risk in the greater part of Firefall to warrant it. Most enemies aren't equipped with the smarts to step away from incoming gunfire, let alone process your ability to jetpack to high ground or a few hundred feet away. Even if you manage to die, the only consequence is the long jog back to the battlefield. If you can't entertain yourself by clambering around the environment to line up a nice screenshot, then this remediation of rates becomes the salient feature of Firefall. The game is a cold war against the extra seconds, minutes, and hours that are cast in front of you to turn the eye towards the real-money marketplace. If you want to craft items, you need to pay your tithe in either time or dollars, but the more efficient player sees that mission rewards supersede anything you could create anyway. Even savvier players might eschew the missions entirely, to better focus on the pop-up side-quests that can be turned in a bit quicker, without any of that tedious exposition. While there isn't anything inherently wrong with a free-to-play model, it does stretch what would otherwise be a once-a-month decision to re-up a subscription into a perpetual state of cost-benefit evaluation. It's hard to invest in lore that's so inextricably tied to the grind of missions or side-quests, hard to suspend your awareness of that grind when you're awash in constant pitches for boosters and special unlocks. A purchasable vehicle might mitigate the dreary 1,200m hike between mission markers, but a better game wouldn't have the dreary hike in the first place. I could avoid all that for a time, and maybe do some climbing, but you always have to come down eventually. In Firefall, there isn't much waiting for you when you do."
1580,Final Fantasy XIV Online: A Realm Reborn,9.0,2,"Final Fantasy XIV 1.0 into A Realm Reborn back in 2013 was a triumph, not only attracting scores of new players into the virtual world of Eorzea, but also demonstrating that a gorgeous, content-rich and regularly updated subscription-based MMORPG was still a viable prospect. With the release of Heavensward, the question is whether this new expansion can keep players invested and ensure the long-term future of Eorzea. Game of Thrones-style finale. It's worth noting that as a prerequisite to enjoying anything this expansion has to offer--including the three new jobs; Dark Knight, Machinist and Astrologian--you must have finished A Realm Reborn's entire story, including its five content patches. This is non-negotiable. You are prohibited from even entering Heavensward's main city, Ishgard, until the entire prior storyline has been completed. This may be frustrating to those who enjoyed A Realm Reborn but never worked their way through the narrative. Many MMOs tend to open up expansion content immediately upon release for those at an appropriate character level, regardless of their quest progress, but Square Enix has taken a stricter approach here. However, this makes sense in the context of the game as a whole, since Final Fantasy XIV is one of the most narrative-rich MMOs on the market. Thankfully, the prerequisite content has been adjusted and rebalanced to ensure that players can get through it and into Heavensward as painlessly as possible with minimal grinding: simply following the main A Realm Reborn quest will now see you happily outfitted in good quality gear by its conclusion, ready to begin your new adventures. (Previously, the game necessitated a certain degree of replaying old content to earn enough endgame currency to purchase this gear, but now main story quests provide you with everything you'll need to survive your first foray into Ishgard and beyond.) Heavensward's main story is spectacular, with a series of dramatic moments throughout that are among the series' most memorable. The overall plot deals with themes such as the unquestioning adoption of religious dogma and how that can lead to societal problems such as racism--or in this case, speciesism, thanks to the conflict between the Ishgardians and the Dravanian dragons. It also captures the feel of a traditional Final Fantasy even better than A Realm Reborn had, due to some excellent writing and strong characters, presented with a delightfully theatrical tone throughout, which builds on the substantial lore introduced in the game's previous incarnations. The writing also boasts strong characterisation, including some deep, detailed exploration of interesting yet tragically flawed characters such as Ysayle, who we only saw briefly in A Realm Reborn. Meanwhile, the ensemble of non-player characters evoke a delightful feeling of going on a grand adventure with a party, similar to that in a single-player RPG. The storytelling is supported by a beautiful soundtrack and voice acting of a considerably higher calibre than that heard in A Realm Reborn--though the decision to recast most of the main voices, in some cases with entirely different regional British accents to the characters' previous incarnations, is a little jarring at first. To help flesh out the game's substantial lore, Heavensward's main narrative is supported by side quests, and there are a lot of them. So many, in fact, that it's possible to level from 50 to 60 using little more than the main story and the various NPCs you come into contact with on your travels. Although grinding dungeons will probably get you to level 60 quicker, following the side quests gives you a much more arresting, varied experience, particularly if you're interested in the game world's lore. Guild Wars 2's ""Vista"" system. The decision to prevent you from flying in each zone until you've discovered all these aether currents has proven divisive, but ultimately it works out for the best with regard to world-building and narrative coherence. The new zones are huge in scale, and you truly come to appreciate the massive size of some of the structures and geographical features by traversing them on foot before being able to simply fly from one place to another. Travelling on foot can lead to some exciting discoveries too. Follow the river north out of the village of Tailfeather in the Dravanian Forelands, for example, and you come across some dramatic ruins of a lost age; head out in another direction and you might find yourself pondering where the giant craters in the ground came from--that is, until the gigantic Tarasque shows up and requires at least twenty or thirty players to subdue. These discoveries lose some of their impact if you just fly in a straight line from point A to point B, so the game funnels players into seeing most of the world from ground-level before allowing them a bird's-eye view. Somewhat more controversial at launch are the balance changes that came as a result of the three new jobs and the five new abilities that each of the existing classes have been given. The ranged-damage classes (Bard and Machinist) were both underpowered upon Heavensward's original release, even in good gear at level 60, but at the time of writing, an update has provided both classes with an increase in power to their new abilities, and they're performing much more solidly in parties as a result. Meanwhile, the gun-wielding Machinist is now producing damage numbers that can compete even with the melee classes Monk, Dragoon and Ninja, which are traditionally the most heavy hitters. Elsewhere, Bard players are happy to finally have a damage-dealing Limit Break ability, which is a welcome addition for a class that was unofficially regarded as a support job. New tank class Dark Knight is proving to be a solid addition to many groups, with its blend of Warrior's heavy damage-dealing and Paladin's damage mitigation providing a fun new play style. New healer Astrologian, meanwhile, provides an interesting mix of both Scholar and White Mage's strong points, with its central mechanic of drawing and shuffling cards to provide the group with various benefits making it a unique take on a support class. Both are challenging to learn if you're used to the older classes, but both are very rewarding to master. Existing classes have had some interesting changes, too. Paladin, for example, long derided as the most boring but functional tank class, now has several different combos as well as some useful support and healing abilities. Monk continues to be the class of choice for those who enjoy a highly technical play style. Black Mages now have even more of a buff-juggling-act to keep up with. And Summoners, once regarded as one of the weaker DPS classes in A Realm Reborn, have enjoyed a considerable buff thanks to some new abilities and spells, and have become very popular as a result--though at least part of this is doubtless due to the fact that their level-three Limit Break now involves sprouting Bahamut's wings and setting fire to everything. Yes, it's as awesome as it sounds. Crucially, with the balance adjustments brought about in the first patch, no single class feels significantly better or worse than others; pretty much any party makeup can comfortably clear everything the game has to offer at the time of writing. In terms of content, Heavensward ships with a decent amount to work through. The main story, as previously noted, takes somewhere in the region of 40 to 50 hours hours or so to finish, depending on how thorough you are, and in the process you level at least one class to 60 naturally. Beyond that, at the time of writing, level cap content includes three dungeons, one of which is officially part of the main story and can be re-challenged as often as you like. There is enough content here to even satisfy the hardcore raiders; there's the story's final boss battle, two Extreme variants on earlier boss battles against the primals Bismarck and Ravana, and the new raid dungeon Alexander, which is set to have a Savage difficulty variant added. As with A Realm Reborn, content of all levels--not just level-cap dungeons and trials--is designed to be replayed frequently, with endgame currency that can be exchanged for high-end gear on offer for jumping into daily roulettes and helping lower-level players with earlier content as well as simply grinding level-appropriate challenges. The dungeons are smartly designed throughout the entirety of Heavensward, featuring dynamic backdrops, surprising events, gorgeous scenery and exciting encounters that often demand a lot more of a group than simple ""tank and spank""; one dungeon in particular even makes use of simplified forms of the challenging mechanics found in A Realm Reborn's raid dungeon, The Binding Coil of Bahamut. The decision to eliminate mid-dungeon cutscenes has alleviated the problem A Realm Reborn's final storyline dungeon had, where experienced players would charge ahead and start boss fights while fresh level 50s were watching cutscenes, causing the latter to get locked out. This is a change for the better; there's still story content in dungeons, but it tends to unfold either at the very beginning (when all players are unable to move until everyone is ready) or after the final boss has been defeated. In other words, those enjoying the story for the first time can do so without guilt that they're holding people up, and experienced players who are just grinding dungeons can do so without having to sit and wait for newbies. Meanwhile, crafters and gatherers are well catered to, since all these classes can also be levelled to 60. A couple of new elements feel a little underbaked, however; the airship crafting in the new Free Company workshops simply requires a party of crafters to be present without any real interaction or cooperation required--it would have been interesting to see the equivalent of a ""crafting raid"", since Final Fantasy XIV's crafting system has just as much depth as its battle system, but sadly, it is not to be. Yet. And that ""yet"" is an important point; A Realm Reborn enjoyed substantial content updates and mechanical adjustments at three-month intervals following its launch, and Heavensward is set to follow suit, with the first post-launch patch already released, introducing the Alexander raid and addressing some balance issues. The main story, despite coming to a spectacular (and Final Fantasy fan-baiting) conclusion, is left open for an episodic continuation in the same way as A Realm Reborn, and the game's structure is eminently friendly to new dungeons and challenges being added at regular intervals. Plus, at some point in the near future, the true masochists among us will be able to grind our way through a whole new Relic quest. Overall, then, Heavensward is an essential purchase for those who have spent more hours than they'd care to admit in Eorzea. While new players--or those who never beat A Realm Reborn's complete story--may feel aggravated at being locked-out of the expansion until they catch up, there's little denying that Final Fantasy XIV as a whole offers astonishing value for those willing to immerse themselves, and it will only continue to grow and expand over time. In other words, it looks like Eorzea is unlikely to suffer another world-shattering calamity just yet, and everyone who has made it their home away from home over the last couple of years will doubtless be thankful for that."
3959,ATV: Quad Power Racing,5.0,1,"The PlayStation has few software gaps waiting to be filled. With well over 1000 games available, it has everything from four versions of Bust-A-Move to a Teletubbies game. While dirt bike racers are really nothing new, Acclaim has decided to forgo the usual two-wheeler route in favor of attempting to tap into what it must see as the cash-ready four-wheeler market. Kids living in the sticks or professional quad racers might find the game inviting initially, but ATV: Quad Power Racing is really just another PlayStation niche title that misses the mark.   ATV: Quad Power Racing has four modes: championship, single race, time attack, and two-player. Championship mode has both pro and amateur circuits where you race against five other quads vying for first place. You start championship mode by picking one of the six available riders and one of two available quads and then choosing one of three tracks to race on. The only difference between the amateur circuit and the pro circuit is shortcuts located throughout the tracks - they're boarded up in amateur races and opened in the professional circuit. The stereotypical forest, snow, and desert environs are here, but any sort of indoor tracks have been omitted. If you complete a track in first place, you may move on to the next version of the track. Two quads are available out of the jewel case and four other bikes can be unlocked when you do well in the championship mode. A secret ""super quad"" is available once you conquer the professional circuit. Each quad has its own unique attributes for acceleration, suspension, and top speed, and you can really feel the difference in each bike's abilities, especially handling.   The single-race mode lets you take a spin on any of the unlocked tracks, while time attack lets you race for the lowest time possible. Both modes make the process of learning the tracks somewhat easier. The two-player mode is probably the most fun you'll have with ATV: Quad Power Racing. Here the frame rates stay solid most of the time, and the tracks are long enough that you can stay in the race despite several wrecks.    The tracks are extremely long - we're talking bust-out-the-eye-drops long. By the time you make it to the third lap, you'll be sick of squinting to see where the track leads next and even more pained by sitting on pins and needles, scared to make the one mistake that will cost you the race. The steering control is fine, but merely tapping the brakes slows you down so much that it almost guarantees you'll soon be eating someone else's dirt spray. The powerslide isn't much help either because it also slows down your bike far too much. You're faced with the challenge of keeping the throttle wide open while bouncing over the hilly, curvy terrain - a near impossibility. There is also a strange physics glitch where bumping into bikes in front of you sends the competition sprinting ahead while you pick the dirt clots out of your goggles. Other times, running into someone from behind sends you and your bike inexplicably rocketing 100 feet into the air. This is especially frustrating considering the ATVs are wide enough to take up more than half the width of the track.    Even more frustrating is that the artificial intelligence is far too daunting - even on the very first track. You may cruise along without a single collision or miscue for a lap or two, but the second you even so much as veer slightly off-road, you can guarantee that you'll be passed by at least two riders. This is especially frustrating in the initial stages of play when you're simply trying to become accustomed to the game's controls. There are shortcuts located on each track, and once you learn to use them, things do become a bit easier, but the limited payoff of one super quad does not justify the difficulty you will have completing this game.   ATV: Quad Power Racing isn't going to win any best-graphics awards. There are only three texture sets used throughout the entire game, and the variations for each track are in track design only. There are no monumental structures to serve as reminders of upcoming terrain, so to succeed in the game you have to memorize each of the four variations of the near-identical tracks - a difficult task. Texture seams are apparent, especially on the snow track, and getting close to any of the objects located off-road will make most graphics purists wince because of their surreal pixelated look. When riders ahead of you go over the top of a hill, you can see them through the terrain going down the other side. This actually helps you prepare for the next turn, but the realism takes a serious hit. The riders also seem way too thin relative to the quads, and the real-time damage that the four-wheelers are supposed to take is barely noticeable, if at all.   On the positive side, the frame rate does manage to stay fairly steady, even with five other riders onscreen, and the riders and bikes react accurately to the terrain as Acclaim has done a nice job with the physics engine. Considering how fast you have to go just to stay in the race, it's annoying that every bump has a tendency to send you way off the course. There is very little texture warping or flicker, and the draw-in isn't overly offensive. Some adequate weather effects like rain are thrown in to spruce things up, and your rider will occasionally taunt the competition as well.   The looped guitar rock isn't too obtrusive at first, but after extended play periods, most or you will want to turn it down or off altogether. The sound effects are far too quiet when mixed with the music, and when you do finally hear the squeals of the bikes, they sound more like souped-up Lawn-Boys than dirt demons anyway. There is also an annoying glitch where the game pauses for a brief second while the music tracks start over.   While there may be some ATV enthusiasts out there who will get enough out of ATV: Quad Power Racing to warrant a rental, those who are only mildly into the sport will be disappointed by the game's repetitive graphics, steep learning curve, and overall lack of variety or fun."
3599,Cube (2007),5.0,1,"  Before you get too excited, know that Cube the game is not based on the 1997 sci-fi film, Cube. Instead, Cube is a puzzle game for the PlayStation Portable that has you moving a nondescript block around 135 abstract levels of varying degrees of difficulty. It's a fine concept, but unfortunately the puzzles in Cube are less a test of your spatial reasoning and more a test of your ability to situate the game's camera so you can see what you're doing. The uninspired puzzles are made all the more boring by the completely lifeless presentation in Cube. Even with the addition of a level editor and ad hoc multiplayer with game sharing, Cube just doesn't do enough to set it apart from numerous, better puzzle games already available for the PSP.        In Cube, you control a transparent cube that can move in four directions, with one side always connected to a solid object like a block. There is no gravity in the game, so you can move your cube along all sides of the blocks that make up the level. The goal of each level is to reach the exit panel, which is invariably tucked away behind barriers or hazards or floating on a distant, disconnected block. It's your job to hit switches that make barriers retract or make new blocks appear to create a path to the exit panel. Sometimes the puzzle is even simpler than that, merely requiring you to navigate a short path of connected cubes to reach the exit.      Many levels have hazards such as rolling mines, quicksand, or moving blocks that will crush you if you aren't careful. These hazards are usually easy to avoid if you can see them, but unfortunately the camera makes that more difficult than it should be. By default, the camera stays behind your block, and you can zoom in or out as desired. You can also press the R or L button to rotate the camera around your block to get a better viewing angle of the path ahead. Technically this works fine, but it's a pain to have to move one space, adjust the camera, move another space, adjust the camera, and so on for each move you make. It can also be incredibly confusing and disorienting to constantly change the camera angle, making it easy to get turned around upside down and backward.      Taking time to adjust the camera is tedious, and it impedes your success with the game. Each level has keys scattered about that you have to collect before reaching the exit. If you collect the keys and get to the exit within a set time limit, you get a gold medal for the level. As a result, every second counts, so while you're trying to make a break for the exit, you won't have time to futz with the camera. The easiest way to get a gold medal is to fail the level enough times to memorize exactly what you have to do step-by-step, and then execute those steps as quickly as possible. Needless to say, that's not a satisfying way to solve a puzzle. That trial-and-error process is also frustrating because when you die, it takes about 10 seconds to reload the level so you can try again.      The levels take anywhere from 10 seconds to 10 minutes to complete, and you'll see many recurring designs throughout the game's 135 levels. In the single-player game, the levels are grouped into zones, with three zones for each of the three difficulty levels. Aside from the color of the blocks and the background, there's very little difference from zone to zone, which saps any sense of accomplishment or progression you might have derived from playing through level after level, zone after zone.      The presentation in Cube leaves much to be desired. The vast majority of levels and backgrounds are all shaded in a single color, and aside from the layout, the only difference from level to level is which color you'll be looking at. For example, the three zones in the medium difficulty are ""aqua,"" ""navy,"" and ""blue."" The difference between each of those zones? In each, the blocks and backgrounds are slightly different shades of blue. The music in each level is just as generic, and it's so subdued you'll hardly even know it's there.         Cube at least comes with a decent assortment of extras to make it feel a little less barren. There's an easy-to-use and fairly robust level editor that lets you create your own puzzles, and you can share them with friends via an ad hoc connection. You can also connect with friends to play two-player multiplayer games. There are four multiplayer game types. You can race to see who can collect the most keys, race to be the first to the exit, play cooperatively to give one another a boost to reach the exit, or play a simple battle mode and try to direct bombs at your opponent. All of these modes are available when using the game sharing feature, but the level selection is restricted unless both players have a copy of the game. The multiplayer modes are slightly more exciting than the single-player game, but they still aren't fun enough to make this game a good value, even at its budget price.     If you're looking for a puzzle game to kill a few hours, you should look to games like Lumines, Puzzle Quest, Mercury Meltdown, Gunpey, Capcom Puzzle World, Exit, Lemmings, PQ: Practical Intelligence Quotient, and, well, you get the picture. There's no shortage of good puzzle games available for the PSP, so there's little reason to spend your time and money on Cube.  "
3820,Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem,5.0,1,"  From beginning to end, Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem is an incredibly easy game. There's not a single moment in this third-person shooter when you feel the least bit challenged, whether in terms of combat, scavenger hunting, or its occasional attempts at platforming. Although it's true that a game's difficulty is hardly the sole indicator of its overall quality, every other part of the game is far too mired in blandness to prevent you from drifting off under the spell of mindlessly simple gameplay.         Ever the movie tie-in, AvP shares a similar plot with the upcoming film of the same name. In short, an alien ship has come crashing down in small-town Colorado, and you (the predator) must destroy all traces of this newfound extraterrestrial life in the area. Along the way, you'll also encounter a smattering of humans, both of the military and unarmed civilian variety. There's early promise when you gleefully toy with the predator technology at your disposal, such as invisibility cloaking, three types of special vision modes, and a handful of neat weapons. Unfortunately, that novelty quickly wears off as you discover there's rarely any strategic purpose in using any of it.      For this you can thank a combat system balanced too heavily in your favor, as well as level objectives marked out in painfully obvious detail. When it comes to fighting, you're basically invincible. Your health bar can be depleted, but if you're feeling particularly low you can simply bring up the map screen and literally choose the ability to restore all your health. The price for drinking at this fountain of eternal life? Your energy bar (which fuels cloaking and certain types of optional weaponry) depletes for a brief 10 seconds. On top of that, taking down enemies is as easy as pressing both shoulder buttons to lock on and using your preferred ranged weapon to kill them from afar; the need to mix up weaponry never once arises. Battling swarms of aliens and armed military personnel amounts quickly enough to more of a mild nuisance, akin to swatting flies, than anything resembling a compelling challenge.      One wrinkle added to the combat is the inclusion of honor points. They're a reward for not killing civilians and ""tagging"" an alien before you blast it away. The more you get, the more you can upgrade your predator's armor and weapons. The problem is that you can haphazardly kill anything that moves and still stumble into plenty of honor points. Furthermore, all they really do is make your already invincible predator that much more dominating.           But the game has you do more than just kill. You'll also need to find bits of alien technology (pieces of their ship, etc.) scattered across the levels so you can dissolve them from existence. Unfortunately, any sense of exploration is squashed by a map screen that pinpoints the exact location of all these chunks of alien refuse. The game holds your hand just as tightly as you advance through the levels. Any time you need to smash a weakened wall or turn a crank to progress to the next area, these point of interest are already marked with a giant, twirling red triangle. You're left wondering why you're playing at all if the game won't let you figure anything out on your own.      That said, the levels themselves do have a nice bit of variety. Early on you'll be prowling through a dense forest, whereas down the road you might find yourself going toe-to-toe with aliens on a basketball court--no, that's not a metaphor for shooting hoops--in the game's high school level. What's more, you get to choose your path in the game. For example, you can make your way through the town by going underground, through the suburbs, or via the industrial buildings. But these branching paths all wind up at the same final level with the same ending. The foregone conclusion of a finale really puts a damper on this feeling of choice. Equally disappointing is the fact that these levels, though varied in setting, tend to look consistently drab and uninteresting with their lack of light and muddy textures. It's not bad, by any means--just really bland. The same can be said for the game's limited sound effects and easily forgotten music.           As mentioned before, it's awfully easy to drift off while playing AvP because none of the game's peripheral elements do much to keep your interest. This is true for the bonus skirmish mode as well as the ad-hoc multiplayer. In skirmish, you're given five minutes to clear out as many aliens as you can in one of the levels from the main storyline. The final score is tallied up in honor points, but nothing really comes of it. No rewards, no unlockables, nothing. The ad-hoc multiplayer is basically co-op skirmish in which you play alongside a friend. Even in this mode, you're still not given anything of value for your efforts, just a meaningless score and the feeling that you've wasted the last five minutes.     In the end, Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem isn't a terrible game; it's just really mediocre. It's hard to say if it would be more interesting if it weren't so easy, given that so much of the game fails to grab your attention even when you're not taking difficulty into account. What's easy to say is that there are far better action games on the PSP than this one.     "
3326,GoldenEye 007 (2010),8.0,2,"GoldenEye 007 was released for the Nintendo 64. It's impossible to ignore the impact this game had on the future of the industry, but don't assume that the Wii game bearing the same name is a mere remake of the seminal original. The new GoldenEye 007 is a modern game that refuses to cater to an old-school audience, giving it the freedom to develop a personality all its own. The varied and lengthy campaign smartly alternates between tense stealth missions and exhilarating run-and-gun forays that make it difficult to pull away. And though the online multiplayer uses the ubiquitous perks system to reward you for your hard work, it's the sharp controls and complex levels that will have you coming back for more. GoldenEye 007 doesn't rely on the memories of an aged shooter to be great; it earns that distinction on its own merits.          GoldenEye 007 is an entirely new game, but that doesn't mean it has completely turned its back on everything that made the original distinct. James Bond is a world-class spy, and both games dramatize this fascinating profession by putting you through the rigors of globe-trotting espionage. There is a strong emphasis on stealth in GoldenEye that rewards patient players who would rather silently avoid a firefight than rush in guns blazing. Whether you favor a sure shot from your silenced pistol or a quick melee strike when you move in close, quietly killing off your enemies is a thrilling rush that serves as your main tactic for most of this campaign. The AI is occasionally alerted even when you swear you're safely behind cover, but that inconsistency is rare. For the most part, using stealth is your wisest strategy, and you can discreetly kill off a small platoon without anyone noticing that something's wrong.      Of course, a spy is more than just a silent assassin. James Bond doesn't travel around the world just to satiate his bloodlust, after all; he's on a mission to discover some kind of horrible truth. And to acquire these facts, you have to do some sleuthing along the way. Every level has objectives you must complete in between bouts of killing, and though they provide an interesting diversion from the core gameplay, they're not exactly mind-blowing. Most of them involve utilizing your handy smartphone to do things like snap a photograph or hack a device, and it's just a matter of lining up your target and hitting a button. But what makes these moments as impactful as the shoot-to-kill action is the problem solving that goes along with them. For example, in the first level, you need to access a room that is seemingly sealed shut. But if you poke your gun through a small opening in the window, you can shoot off the lock barring your entry. These puzzles are easy enough if you just take a quick peek around the environment, but they do a good job of reinforcing the fact that you're a spy.        James Bond has no problem gathering vital information and certainly knows how to avoid a fight, but when the action heats up, he's not afraid to take advantage of his license to kill. The shooting in GoldenEye is incredibly smooth whether you favor the quick-pointing precision of the Wii Remote or the traditional, dual-analog maneuverability offered by the GameCube or Classic Controller. You can easily target whatever vital organ or flailing appendage you prefer on an onrushing enemy, and the dull impact of a bullet that strikes pay dirt delivers an exhilarating thrill. Sharp controls aren't the only reason that shooting is such a satisfying endeavor in GoldenEye; your impressive loadout gives you plenty of firepower with which to play around. Pistols, rifles, shotguns, and more come with all sorts of different attributes, and it's easy to find one you like because they all feel so good. But James Bond has plenty of options beyond firing his gun, and the smooth shooting mechanics ensure you're immersed no matter which path you take.     The single-player campaign stretches on for more than 10 hours, and a good deal of variety banishes any chance of repetition ruining your enjoyment. Some levels are designed with stealth in mind while others force combat to the forefront, but you ultimately have the choice in how you play. The tempo changes in a heartbeat if you accidentally alert your enemies, and though you may kick yourself for being so clumsy, it's always a blast to loudly gun down your enemies when you were being so quiet just a moment earlier. There are other gameplay twists that ensure the campaign doesn't tread predictable waters: brief vehicle sections thrust raw destructive power into your hands, a frantic escort sequence pushes your reflexes to the edge, and even an intense boss fight is thrown in for good measure. The only misstep comes in the form of tedious quick-time events that are overflowing with cinematic flair but aren't any fun to play. But aside from these moments, GoldenEye 007 stays engaging all the way through.      The staying power of GoldenEye stretches far beyond completion of the last level. This is a game that's meant to be played more than once because the higher difficulty levels do more than just ramp up the ruthlessness of your enemies. The harder the game is, the more objectives you have to complete to move on, and replaying these levels gives you a new appreciation for how well they're constructed. Rooms and routes you never realized existed are suddenly integral parts of the experience, making another play-through feel fresh even though you're traipsing through the same environments. What's really interesting is how your health is managed. In all but the hardest difficulty level, you have regenerating health. Because you return to full strength by staying out of fire for a few seconds, the campaign veers on the easy side, though it's still challenging enough to make it rewarding when you do come out on top. But when you play on the hardest difficulty, your health no longer regenerates and you collect armor to save you from death. This ratchets up the tension another notch, making you use every stealth trick you've learned to stay alive.        The only problem with replaying levels comes from the invasive story. Pierce Brosnan played James Bond in the original game and movie, but he has been unceremoniously axed in this latest outing. In his stead is current Bond actor Daniel Craig. But it doesn't really matter who assumes the lead role when the story is never pushed beyond spy-thriller cliches. Evil Russians and predictable plot twists are the driving forces of this newly written story, but even though there are some well-done action sequences, the cutscenes ultimately fail to enhance the experience. James Bond is a man of fast action, and the levels embrace his single-minded determination. Unfortunately, the cutscenes are unskippable, so you have to sit through the story every time you replay a level. These unremarkable sequences become unpleasant intrusions, and its grueling to have to wait them out, knowing how much you have to bust your butt to meet the stringent requirements when you reassume control.     Aside from the intrusive story and a few lame quick-time events, the campaign is an incredible experience. But if you hunger for something beyond the expansive single-player suite, there's engaging competitive multiplayer to take part in as well. If you favor the online realm, you can square off against up to seven other players in a variety of play types. Sharp controls and clever level design make it a blast to gun down strangers and friends alike; the rewards system also gives you something to strive for aside from the satisfying thrill of victory. You unlock new weapons, gadgets, and modes as you sink more time into the game, so there's always something to tinker with after a successful play session. But there are a few missteps along the way. First, there's no support for WiiSpeak. It's awfully lonely gunning down voiceless players, and the lack of communication makes the team matches slightly chaotic. Also, there is a distinct lack of Bond flavor. You assume control of a nameless grunt working for either MI6 or the Russians, and aside from a few nods like the Golden Gun mode, there's little here to differentiate this from other shooters. Despite those issues, it is still a lot of fun, and a smooth frame rate ensures technology won't impact your enjoyment.        Offline fare is just as robust, but in a different way. The experience points system has been completely scrapped, but in its stead is a good array of modifiers to let you put your own spin on how things play out. You and up to three friends take part in split-screen action, and you can tweak options that make your grenades sticky or bouncy, force players to explode when they come into contact with others, or shrink everyone down to bite-sized proportions. The best of these instantly kills anyone who stands still for too long. It's a great way to eliminate snipers and campers because it makes people push the action rather than wait for things to come to them. You can also choose from a bunch of different James Bond characters from movies past. Some of them, like Oddjob, even have a special ability. He can throw a hat instead of a grenade, which is surprisingly deadly. All of these options are great, but there are two flaws. First, everything feels really slow, moving half as fast as online or single-player competition. Second, there aren't any bots, so there is downtime while you search for your next victim. It's still fun to mess around with all the tweaks, but these issues hinder the long-term appeal.     Despite a few problems in the multiplayer department, GoldenEye 007 is a great game that does justice to its prestigious name. Instead of living in the past, Bond's latest adventure embraces the present. The explosive single-player campaign is an incredible ride all the way through, and it's well worth replaying a few times just to see what sort of cool secrets the harder difficulties hide. The online multiplayer may be James Bond in name only, but that won't matter when you're gunning down enemies and racking up experience points. Sharp controls, clever level design, and a wealth of gameplay options are the backbone of this exhilarating shooter, and it absolutely nails its core tenets. GoldenEye 007 has no need to rely on nostalgia when it so expertly creates such thrilling new memories.    "
31,Lies of P,8.0,2,"There's no shortage of Souls-likes vying for our attention, but only one can claim to put a dark and twisted spin on the everlasting story of Pinocchio. Developed by South Korean studio Neowiz Games, Lies of P presents a very loose retelling of Italian author Carlo Collodi's 1883 novel The Adventures of Pinocchio. This grim reimagining, combined with a striking Belle Epoque-infused setting, ensures that Lies of P's aesthetic stands apart from other Souls-likes, including From Software's own. Bloodborne is still a clear inspiration, as its tonal atmosphere and combat design call to mind the cosmic horror masterpiece, leading to it feeling overly derivative at times. Still, Neowiz also implements just enough originality for Lies of P to eke out its own identity, even if it's as thin as a puppet string.The story sees you take on the role of P, a lifelike puppet who wakes up amidst the carnage of a puppet-led invasion of the fictional city of Krat. If you're familiar with Pinocchio, you'll likely recognize character names such as the puppet-maker Geppetto and the talking cricket Gemini. Their names are usually where the similarities end, however--either in relation to the book or any Disney-produced retellings. For one, Gemini isn't an anthropomorphic insect but rather a tiny puppet caged in a lantern on P's belt, acting as both a guide and source of light. Similarly, characters like the Fox, Cat, and Alidoro are reimagined as common criminals and thieves, who don their respective animal masks in order to achieve both anonymity and infamy.It's this unique take on a familiar tale that makes Lies of P such an intriguing proposition, so it's hard not to feel disappointed when the story doesn't kick into gear until close to its final act. For the most part, you're tasked with visiting various locations where you'll need to either rescue someone or defeat a specific enemy before returning to the game's central hub. Without an overarching goal to propel you forward, it feels unfocused and only attains a sense of momentum in its final few hours once the antagonist reveals themself. There's very little to latch onto before this point, outside of a curiosity to see where the narrative could potentially go. It's not a case where the game is holding back and being intentionally opaque either. The story is predominantly told via expositional dumps and there's little sense of mystery as a result. There are interesting moments dotted throughout but they're fleeting, and I don't think it's too harsh to expect more considering the source material.Lies of P also features a morality system that occasionally asks you to make a choice between two options: Tell the truth or lie. Puppets can't lie--it's baked into their programming--but as we all know, Pinocchio is special in this regard. The lies you tell are almost never hurtful or deceitful; you lie to provide comfort rather than confront someone with an uncomfortable truth. One such example lets you ease a dying mother's worry by telling her that her (dead) child is still alive and well, so these choices aren't particularly difficult to make. The decision you choose will mostly depend on which branching path you're eager to see play out. Every time you lie, P's springs react--he becomes more human--so I exclusively lied throughout my playthrough to see what effect this would have on either the story or gameplay. I won't spoil the changes I encountered but overall the mechanic didn't feel well used. Neowiz says there are three different endings to unlock, which are affected in some way by how honest you are, but aside from attaining different rewards, it's tough to say how much of the game is impacted by your choices without replaying the whole thing again.Nevertheless, the morality system and the story's shortcomings are lessened somewhat by Lies of P's setting and fantastic sense of place. Each location you visit is sprinkled with interesting lore and visual storytelling, and the game's art design and foreboding atmosphere combine to give the city of Krat an unmistakable personality. The prospect of venturing further into its haunting bowels was all the motivation I needed to push on.Krat's Belle Epoque-era aesthetic is immediately evocative of 19th-century France, right down to the snippets of Bal-musette music that still linger, like echoes of the city's former glory. Back before the events of the game, Krat was a city of marvels. The invention of animatronic puppets gave rise to a period of prosperity that's evident throughout, as Neowiz meshes its historical setting with notable steampunk flourishes. After flying too close to the sun, however, the city's affluence has been shattered by what survivors are calling The Puppet Frenzy. This mysterious affliction has turned the once-docile puppets against the city's denizens in violent fashion. Blood-stained bodies now litter the cobblestone streets, while bags of luggage are strewn next to carriages and across train platforms as evidence of those trying to escape the fallen metropolis.Gaslit street lamps and glaring signs for theater productions cast light on the gloomy aftermath, as twitchy, clockwork puppets emerge from the shadows wielding battered stop signs and candelabras as makeshift weapons. Lies of P oozes atmosphere at nearly every turn, whether you're traversing through Krat's bleeding heart or wading through the ominous forests and scrap yards on its outskirts. The striking visuals aren't just for show either, as it's melded into excellent level design that adopts the strongest aspects of the genre. There's obvious care and attention put into enemy variety and placement, and locations tend to corkscrew back on themselves, rewarding your exploration with vital shortcuts via ladders and unlocked doors.Lies of P's basic framework is also familiar, latching onto many of the genre's long-standing hallmarks. Stargazers act as Bonfires; Ergo is an upgrade resource you attain by defeating enemies; you lose Ergo when you die, unless you're able to return to the site of your demise and reclaim it; the leveling system is stat-based, which has an additional impact on weapon buffs; and Neowiz even has a penchant for bombarding you with giant rolling balls, turning any incline into a potential threat.Combat, meanwhile, shares a number of elements in common with Bloodborne. Encounters are fast-paced and emphasize being active and pushing the advantage. You can block attacks, which chips away at both your stamina and health bar, but immediately retaliating lets you regain your lost health. This quickly establishes that it pays to be aggressive, even if you initially adopt a defensive front. Parrying incoming attacks is more effective, however, since it negates all incoming damage, but doing so is much harder to consistently pull off. The timing window is strict and demands that you learn an enemy's attack patterns and cadence, especially when facing one of the game's fearsome bosses. It's worth achieving some level of proficiency, though, because perfect parries also inflict break damage, sending enemies into a staggered state that leaves them open to a deadly critical strike.Timing, rather than positioning, is key to staying alive, yet this approach turns most encounters--but especially boss fights--into lessons in pattern-learning. The enemies you come up against enjoy messing with your rhythm, hesitating for what feels like a second too long on overhand swings, or throwing in an unexpected attack at the end of a combo. This presents a fun challenge but does feel a tad rigid. Nailing a perfectly timed parry is immensely satisfying, though, with each successful block producing an outpouring of incandescent sparks. Combat, in general, is thrilling throughout. Weapons feel weighty and collide with a delightful thud, discharging a gush of oil that covers P from head to toe. It's punishing as well, to the point where even the lowliest enemies can send you to an early grave if you're not focused. However, the difficulty curve never falls into the trap of feeling unfair. Its challenge increases gradually and I can't say I ever encountered any moments where it felt too easy or too difficult, even if a few bosses stumped me for lengthy periods. From a gameplay perspective, Lies of P is a Souls-like in the purest sense, and an accomplished one at that.Unlike the city's other puppets, which are typically designed with specific functions in mind--think maids, police officers, and miners--P is malleable and can be tinkered with. His left arm, for instance, is home to a variety of secondary weapons, from a Scorpion-esque grappling hook to a mine launcher and flamethrower--fulfilling a similar purpose as Sekiro's prosthetic arm. This system is limiting, to a certain extent, since you can only switch between your various arms when resting at a checkpoint, and while it doesn't allow for the same variety of build options as a From Software game, each one adds a small measure of customization to the game.Despite this, you're still given a healthy degree of freedom when it comes to picking a weapon. Each weapon in the game--with the exception of those acquired from fallen bosses--consists of two distinct components: the head and the handle. The head can be anything from an exploding pickaxe to a saber blade, and this dictates the weapon's attack and guard attributes as well. Meanwhile, the handle affects the weapon's stat-scaling and move set. By using the weapon assembly feature, you can mix and match these two components to create a plethora of unique killing tools.Maybe you'll transform a halberd from a thrusting weapon to a slashing weapon, or alter a strength-based weapon so that it scales with dexterity. Both the head and handle of each weapon also contain a disparate Fable Art--special attacks you can unleash after building up enough Fable energy by damaging opponents. Fable Arts can take the form of a single devastating maneuver, a flurry of consecutive strikes, or even bolster your defensive capabilities for a short while. Being able to pair different Fable Arts adds another layer of flexibility to the weapon assembly system's near-limitless variety.There are a few other specks of originality sprinkled in. When you die and lose your Ergo, for instance, the amount left diminishes each time you sustain damage when attempting to retrieve it. This isn't a massive change, but it adds some extra tension to those moments when you're forced to carefully retrace your steps.For the most part, however, Lies of P is content to adorn existing mechanics and ideas with its own story and aesthetic. This may be a derivative approach, but it nails the core Souls-like experience, with each of its various mechanics seamlessly coalescing to create a thrilling action game that's challenging, varied, and dripping with atmosphere. It's easy to be reductive when a game wears its influences on its sleeve as boldly as Lies of P does, but plenty of other games have tried and failed to recreate the same magic. It's not an easy endeavor, and while it doesn't shake up the formula or reinvent the wheel, Lies of P is still one of the genre's most accomplished and enjoyable entries--and that's the truth."
102,SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake,7.0,2,"In 2003, SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom was released and became a touchstone for a generation of children already obsessed with the cartoon. While nostalgia plays a large factor, I, like many people around my age, hold that game in high regard, even if the experience doesn't quite hold up all these years later. Now, two decades later, SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake has been made as a spiritual successor and, for better and for worse, it plays the way I remember Battle for Bikini Bottom.In The Cosmic Shake, SpongeBob and Patrick stumble upon a Mermaid named Kassandra, who sells antique and mysterious items. SpongeBob purchases bubble soap that supposedly grants wishes, running around town and asking everyone he knows for their wishes. Unfortunately, all of the wishes kick in at once, tearing holes in reality and sending the citizens of Bikini Bottom off into the multiverse, with SpongeBob and Patrick left to pick up the pieces.This opening sets up the seven levels players will explore throughout the game, each one with a different theme and environment. The aesthetic design of these levels is one of the places The Cosmic Shake shines, pulling together references to iconic episodes of the show, while adding new elements that fit within the game's story. A movie-set-themed episode combines SpongBob's obsession with karate with an action movie, and a pirate level has an enemy ship constantly firing pie bombs at you.As for where The Cosmic Shake pulls most of its inspiration from, it stems almost exclusively from the older seasons of SpongeBob. While the show is still airing, many of the references made through the game are from the seasons I watched as a child and easily could have appeared in Battle for Bikini Bottom 20 years ago. There are a few nods to the more modern seasons of the show, specifically Plankton's pet Spot, who serves as a collectible in each level, but the majority of its jokes and callbacks are old-school. Most of these references feel well-placed and don't overstay their welcome, with one major exception.That exception is the caveman level, where Spongebob and Patrick are sent back to the prehistoric era to try and save Squidward. This pulls directly from the episode SB-129/Karate Choppers in Season 1, where Squidward ends up time-traveling to both the past and future. In the past, language hasn't been invented yet, so everyone speaks in gibberish. What works as a small section of a half-hour cartoon overstays its welcome here. In most levels, SpongeBob and Patrick are frequently commenting on the level, spouting off jokes that mostly land, but here, it's an hour to 90 minutes of caveman speak, which really kills the game's momentum.As for the design of the levels, The Cosmic Shake takes a far more linear approach than Battle for Bikini Bottom and this mostly works in its favor. The levels have a bit of width to them, allowing you to explore off the beaten path to find extra Cosmic Jelly, which you are tasked with collecting throughout the game. But beyond this small amount of freedom, this focus on a more linear setup allows for the platforming to shine, since there is a single defined path that can be purposefully designed around the movement skills that have been unlocked so far. SpongeBob comes equipped with a double-jump out of the gate but is quickly given far more movement abilities throughout the game, making for fluid platforming. These movement abilities make SpongeBob feel fast when they are all working together and the sections that ask you to use them all together feel incredibly satisfying.You gain abilities like a glide, a karate kick, a ground pound, and even a grappling hook. Doling out a new ability in most levels means there is always a new mechanic to keep the game fresh, and it provides a way to hide secrets in each level for you to come back to. Levels require you to platform through them, eventually needing to find a number of objects to move further. These sections usually have an arena-like area, where you can choose which direction to start in for your collecting, but always end up at the same destination. It's a nice break from the more linear platforming sections and these sections never overstayed their welcome. Where the linear design falls flat is in the game's secrets and optional objectives.As for combat, you use your new abilities to fight off Cosmic Jelly monsters. There are a number of different types of Jelly Monsters, and each one has a specific way to beat it. Unfortunately, as time goes on, this becomes a tedious task, especially with enemies where you have to wait for an opening. For example, the large enemies carrying bathtubs require three hits to take down, but they only take damage after missing an attack on you. By the time you fight one of these for the 10th time, it becomes more tedious to wait and hit it, which is true for other enemy types as well. There is far more platforming than combat in The Cosmic Shake, but long battles, especially late in the game, feel like a chore.Each level caps off with a boss fight of some kind, with the exact format of the battle changing from level to level. The opening western level concludes with you chasing Mr. Krabs through a train while battling enemies, and the movie level concludes with a showdown against Sandy. None of these are particularly challenging, but they are all different and short enough to be enjoyable.With a linear design and unlockable movement abilities, going off the main path to find a secret can have mixed results. Sometimes you find a Gold Doubloon, which is needed to unlock extra costumes, and it feels rewarding. Many times, though, you find a side objective that is locked behind an ability you don't have yet, which can feel frustrating in the moment. This is obviously meant to get you to come back through each level after beating the game, but replaying levels is where The Cosmic Shake really starts to flounder.Since each level is linear, replaying them can feel like a slog. There are checkpoints that you can choose to start from in each level, but the game doesn't tell you where the collectibles are, just that you are missing them. This means you realistically need to run through the level from start to finish, unless you remember exactly where all the secrets were when you couldn't reach them. And if you miss one on that second runthrough, your only choice is to go for a third. There are some new challenges and sections added after completing the game, but not enough to justify a full second run through any level.While playing The Cosmic Shake is certainly fun, its collectibles and unlockables leave a lot to be desired for one particular reason: There is no point to collecting them. While it is part of the game and platforming is fun enough to make the process enjoyable, the rewards are often lackluster. One of the main mechanics is that with each new multiverse level, SpongeBob is given a new costume to help him fit into the environment. In addition to those costumes, you can also purchase more using the Cosmic Jelly you collect after unlocking them by finding enough Gold Doubloons. The problem here is that the costumes don't impact gameplay in any way, so the novelty wears off quickly. It's cool to spot an outfit that SpongeBob wore in a specific episode, but without any impact on the game itself, they just aren't that interesting.In addition to those disappointing costumes, the other collectibles aren't needed for anything else. The game tells you to collect Cosmic Jelly, but you don't need it to advance from level to level. If an item isn't a part of the main objective in a level, there is zero need or incentive to collect it. Once I realized this in the last few levels, I began ignoring optional platforming challenges that only appeared to reward Cosmic Jelly, since it didn't feel worth my time.Despite a few hiccups and disappointing aspects of The Cosmic Shake design, at its core it achieves its goals. Playing it felt the way I remember Battle for Bikini Bottom playing and all of the jokes and references felt aimed at older SpongeBob fans, pulling straight from the classic episodes. There are tons of small jokes and references in the levels that will make you smile and SpongeBob and Patrick will have you at least chuckling more often than not. It's not a revolutionary platformer, but it is good enough to keep you engaged throughout the entire game's length. If you have no reverence or appreciation for SpongeBob, whether it be the old games or the cartoon, The Cosmic Shake likely won't appeal to you. But for those of us who love SpongeBob, the Cosmic Shake is a great time with some old friends."
2530,NBA Baller Beats,7.0,2,"Dance Central, in NBA Baller Beats you dribble and do various tricks with a basketball that comes with the game.        To begin, you pick your favorite NBA team, and you're dropped into a room themed with that team's logo and colors. You're then given a series of ballhandling tasks that scroll forward in sync with the music. You've got to reproduce the ballhandling tasks properly to advance, and the more correctly you reproduce them, and the more accurately you stay in time with the beat, the higher your score will be.      For those who've never held a basketball before, NBA Baller Beats is a surprisingly useful teaching tool, especially for learning how to dribble precisely with your off hand. As you get higher into the game's levels, you also learn tricks such as behind-the-back dribbles, quick pass fakes, and a variety of other, flashier stuff that's best left to those with more skill than most of us have. In case you're unfamiliar with the basics, there's a tutorial mode called Beat School that you (or, say, a reluctant family member) can use to familiarize yourself with proper form.     While the game is generally sharp in terms of tracking the ball's movements, the Kinect can frustratingly miss some correct dribbles, especially if you're in a small room, lowering your score. Indeed, playing in anything other than a big living room or garage is not recommended, since you're probably not going to have enough space to move around properly, and if the ball slips out of your hands, you're going to break grandma's prized china. You also probably don't want to play this when your neighbors are home if you live in an apartment building, unless you want them to hate you forever. That said, the game does work on carpeted floors--the ball just needs a little extra oomph when you dribble--and you can always play barefoot if you want to reduce sneaker squeal.        When you’re not listening to the ball bounce or to your shoes squeak, though, you get to enjoy NBA Baller Beats’ soundtrack. It’s a relatively diverse affair, featuring songs heavy on beat, but in a variety of genres from rock (Rise Against and Yeasayer) to hip hop (Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa) to electronic (Justice and Skrillex). Most of the songs are top 40 bubble-gum, and some are best forgotten as quickly as you complete a level, but a few are timeless classics, like Eric B. and Rakim’s ""Don’t Sweat the Technique"" and Chromeo’s ""Night by Night.""     It's all pretty good exercise. You work up a sweat after only three or four songs, and you feel like you've been practicing basketball, rather than simply pretending to practice basketball. This isn't just a simulation of dribbling skill tests; it's about as close as you can get in your living room to going to ball practice, and if you stick with the game diligently, you'll doubtless gain ball-handling techniques and ideas you can apply in real life.      Of course, there's only so much you can do with a basketball, even matching it to music, so some tedium can creep in once you've played long enough. Game sessions can start to feel like running drills after a while, which is great if you're trying to keep your handling sharp at home, but there's not enough variety to keep you invested in the long term. You can always invite a friend over to compete against, if you want, which helps spice it up, but there's no simultaneous gameplay (probably wise given space constraints). Instead, you switch out at key points in a song, and the game compares your abilities and precision after the song is over.        While the nod to multiplayer is welcome, it also highlights NBA Baller Beats' biggest shortcoming: its lack of content. There are only so many moves you can do with a basketball, and mixing up the background music and team decals doesn't do much to change up the experience. While scoring mode is nice, there's little in the way of a storyline or twists on the core gameplay to keep you interested beyond a certain point. The game just runs out of steam after a while. In that sense, perhaps it's best thought of as an exercise or practice assistant, and that should be first on potential purchasers' minds when considering where to spend their hard-earned cash.  "
648,Middle-earth: Shadow of War,7.0,2,"Like its predecessor, Shadow of War is populated by powerful Orc Captains that have specific strengths, weaknesses, and personality traits defined by the game's Nemesis system. The number of fears, special abilities, and beneficial powers are much more robust than the first game, making it important to find a strategic approach to taking down some of the game's more powerful foes. The amount of information you get about each Orc once you've revealed its vulnerabilities can feel almost overwhelming, but you quickly adapt to the game's shorthand and what traits to look out for.Your primary goal is to raise an army against the forces of Mordor by recruiting every Orcish leader you meet. These characters strike the perfect balance of humor and absurdity against the dull seriousness of the human cast, and you'll wish the quirkier denizens of Mordor could be constant companions instead of the brief vignettes that flash across the screen when you either kill or are killed by one. One especially colorful character I met was an Orc prophet who yelled at me about some serpent cult he was a part of; I ended up killing him, but it left a lot of questions in my mind about how Orc religions work.Most of your time in Mordor is spent killing Orcs. Building off the first game, Shadow of War has a free-flowing combat system that lets you dominate creatures one-on-one but still stay in control when surrounded by a dozen or more adversaries. That momentum slows when too many things are happening on-screen at once, though. When an enemy captain is ready to be coerced over to your side an icon above his head turns green. Incoming attacks can be countered following a flashing prompt, and you have a slew of different abilities to take out legions of enemies. But the chaos of battle can make targeting opponents frustrating.That's a shame because Shadow of War's most memorable moments revolve around its large-scale Siege battles, where you take over Orc-controlled fortresses using your own loyal followers. With an army of Orcs at your back, both pressing the offensive on a castle and protecting it are equally exciting, and the final entrance into the main hall of a fortress for the final fight feels as reverent and grand as walking into a towering cathedral in real life.In the moment, these tense battles are the core of the Shadow of War experience, but the overarching narrative outside of the broad ""tour Mordor, fight Sauron's forces,"" feels directionless. Part of that's because you don't spend enough time with any secondary characters (except for Gollum, whose brief appearance is somehow still too long). Characters you meet in the game have relatively short asides that range from the absolutely boring ""save some Gondorians"" to the furiously funny ""learn how fight pits work with Bruz the Orc."" It's hard to get invested in the stories of less interesting characters, and once you've completed a few of their quests, they disappear forever anyway. And, like most open-world games, after you've spent a couple hours running around collecting trinkets, it makes an NPC's entreaty about an imminent enemy invasion feel less immediately pressing.But, narrative problems aside, some of the setpieces are breathlessly fun. You ride a drake, team up with some ridiculous Orcs, fight an imposing, flame-winged Balrog, battle the Ringwraiths. It's a greatest-hits compilation of the most bad-ass moments from The Lord of the Rings. After a slow-building introductory act, the game gains momentum as it crashes toward what seems like a final standoff against the forces of evil. And this fight addresses criticism of the previous game; it's an epic multi-stage battle that does still have QTEs, but no more than the ones you find while playing through the game normally.Bafflingly that battle isn't the end of the game. Shadow of War continues on, but with its momentum drained completely. What should be an exciting climax instead descends into a tedious slog for a cutscene that doesn't quite feel worth the time and effort. In the game's actual final act, you cycle through the four fortresses you explored previously for a total of 20 more defending siege battles. If you haven't upgraded the Orcs you met early in the game--and up until this point, there was no reason to--you have to replace and upgrade your entire retinue of Orcs to match this more powerful invading force.It's an entire section that should have been cut or severely truncated, and playing through the repetitious levels felt like padding meant only to make the game last longer.The enemies you face level up with each encounter, so you're also forced into upgrading each castle over and over again, either by building up your current Orc army or finding new fighters and replacing the old. This Sisyphean quest has no corresponding significant characters to keep you company or explain why it's important to tackle the defense missions in the order you do. It's not even clear, exactly, why you want to do them at all.More than once I felt like giving up on this quest thinking I'd stumbled onto some optional side content that was clearly only made for obsessed completionists. But enduring on, I found that finishing every stage unlocks the final cutscene and credits. It did not feel worth it.It's an entire section that should have been cut or severely truncated, and playing through the repetitious levels felt like padding meant only to make the game last longer. But although the game's final act is the most egregious, there are several other systems that Shadow of War fails to justify.Almost every item and Orc has some type of associated rarity (which scales from Common to Rare to Epic to Legendary), and with higher rarity comes more abilities. For Orcs, this means that they have additional, more powerful attributes that aren't available elsewhere. For weapons, it includes perks like ""48% chance that a headshot lights enemies on fire."" The buffs are useful, but the effects aren't so amazing that you'd keep a significantly underpowered weapon or Orc just for its benefits. It feels like a system tacked on purely to add another set of items to collect.The menu systems for your Orcs and weapons is the part that feels most overburdened. It's grating that there's no way to sort or search through your own army if, say, you need an Orc with a cursed weapon and an immunity to beast attacks to take out an especially tricky opponent. But to find out what skills are active based on your current weapon loadout, you have to go to each item in your menu and read up on what you have equipped. There's no overview screen that lists out what effects you currently have active.Like so many of the other game's systems, the storefront feels less predatory and more like a cluelessly unnecessary addition.And buried within the weapon screens is yet another separate item menu, this one for gems. Gems are stat-boosters you find throughout the game that give each item yet another upgrade like increasing the chance that enemies killed with that weapon drop in-game currency or a 12.5% increase to the amount of experience you earn. They're helpful, but managing the upgrades for yet another set of items that are nested as a menu within your own equipment amounts to busywork.Even with the Russian nesting doll of item menus, the most initially intimidating and complex of Shadow of War's systems is its skills menu. There are six primary skill tracks with points that have to be unlocked in order, and each skill has a separate unlockable set of 2-3 sub-skills (only one of which can be activated at any time). The ability grid is so dense and spread out that it's a chore to read through and decide what to put your points into every time you level up. And reallocating in the middle of battle (say if you want an area of effect attack to shoot out flames instead of poison), involves too much work and slows down battle too much to be practical.As an example of how overwrought with options the skill system is, there's an upgrade that unlocks the ability to ""collect items by walking over them."" In normal play, you actually have to manually push a button to pick up every item you come across. It's an ability worth prioritizing when you're looking to spend skill points, but it's nonsensical that such a basic quality of life improvement isn't just the default way item collection works.Despite the bloated feel of its systems, you earn all of these skill points, weapons, and Orcs at such a frantic pace that the game doesn't feel dragged down in the same way as it does by the final act.Going beyond skills and menus, one of Shadow of War's more controversial additions is its online storefront where you can pay real-world money to earn loot boxes that have guaranteed high-rarity Orcs and equipment. One early quest in the game gives you a small sum of the paid currency to purchase some loot boxes, but you can also buy them from the store using an earned in-game currency called Mirian.In our experience with the game, loot boxes purchased with in-game currency only earned us Epic tier rewards, instead of the paid currency’s guaranteed Legendaries. [Editor's Note 10/6 10:50 AM: It is possible to earn Legendary rewards  from loot boxes bought with in-game currency, though they occur with less-frequency than Epic rewards.] However, the difference in quality between the Legendary and Epic Orc rewards, in practice, isn’t substantially different. And after finishing the game, even with buying a dozen or so 1,200 Mirian loot crates over the course of my adventure, I was still left with over 70,000 Mirian in reserve for buying plenty of more loot boxes. It’s also possible for Legendary items and Orcs to appear randomly in-game, so paying real money only serves as a guaranteed way to get one. Like so many of the other game’s systems, the paid storefront feels less predatory and more like an unnecessary addition.And that addition sums up several of Shadow of War's additions--things like the storefront and the menus and loot system don't make the game terrible, it just would've been better without them. It tries to be larger than its predecessor, there are more abilities, more weapons, more Orcs, yet it leaves you wanting less. But at its core, it's a fun experience with brilliant moments that provide fascinating insight into some of the untold stories of Middle-earth. I just wish it had known when to stop."
2495,Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward,8.0,2,"Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors for the DS, a horror-themed adventure game mixing visual-novel-type storytelling scenes and character interaction with puzzle-laden rooms that you needed to escape. The warm reception of that game has now yielded a sequel in Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward--and it's just as enthralling as its predecessor.        Virtue's Last Reward begins with the protagonist, a college student named Sigma, waking up in an elevator next to a strange woman who seems to know more about him than she's letting on. A strange rabbit creature appears on a monitor near them, telling them that they must figure out how to escape the car before it falls. Once they do, they find themselves in an abandoned warehouse with seven other abducted individuals. The creature appears again, telling them that they must all play the Ambidex game to escape their industrial prison. The Ambidex game involves puzzles, traps, and important decisions to either trust or betray your fellow players.      The penalty for losing or failing to comply is death, or possibly an even worse fate.  The game is divided into two distinct sections. As Sigma, you team up with groups of your fellow captives and explore various rooms in this mysterious facility. These rooms are the escape portion of the game: you investigate a room for items, clues, and puzzles to solve, piecing things together until you are finally able to unlock a safe containing an item to allow you to exit.         The story- and dialogue-heavy portions of the game are the novel portions, which appear in between the escape sections and elaborate on the various mysteries the game presents. The game's use of the term ""novel"" to refer to these sections is apt: there's a massive amount of text in Virtue's Last Reward, but because the writing is superb and the voice-over work for the supporting cast (available in both English and Japanese) is excellent, the hours upon hours of dialogue you page through are a pleasure to experience.      The quality of storytelling is a key factor in an adventure game, and Virtue's Last Reward passes that test with flying colors. The game's plot immediately grabs you and rarely lets go, expertly going from a creepy horror premise to an interpersonal character drama to mind-blowing sci-fi concepts. The promise of unraveling the many mysteries--Why are we here? Who are these other people? What purpose do the Ambidex game and the room puzzles serve? What is this facility?--keeps you engaged, and the many new mysteries that appear throughout give you even more reasons to keep playing for hours on end as solutions dangle tantalizingly in front of you, just beyond the reach of the next puzzle.        You also make choices throughout the course of the game that determine the path the story takes during your playthrough, some of which can be truly agonizing. The Ambidex game challenges you to put your trust in the other in-game characters, whom you can choose to either ally with for attempted mutual benefit or betray for increased personal gain. Each choice you make leads to a different branching story path with a different set of rooms and revelations. Unlike Nine Hours, where you had to constantly restart the game to see new paths, Virtue's Last Reward gives you a flowchart that lets you jump back to previous events and choices at any time. It's a great addition that allows you to go back to critical points without playing through the same puzzles over and over--and in order to solve the game's most pervasive mysteries, you need to take several different paths and see many possible endings. Thankfully, handy auto-text and skip functions exist to let you fast-forward through dialogue you may have already seen.        In fact, the whole interface of Virtue's Last Reward is an improvement. Notes you find containing hints to puzzle solutions are stored in a handy file, and a touch-screen memo function can be called upon at any time to write down and recall your own discoveries. Compared to the Vita version, navigation is a little bit tougher, mostly due to the smaller touch-screen size. The lower resolution also makes it harder to see tiny details, though playing on a 3DS XL alleviates this somewhat. One big advantage the 3DS version has, however, is the added precision of the stylus, which allows more accurate examination of smaller objects in the environments.     There are a few minor quibbles with the game, however. Occasionally Sigma suffers from some unexplained personality shifts, going from dead serious to flirtatious and jokey at the drop of a hat. While these shifts don't affect the story greatly, they do get a little bit jarring. Although all of the supporting characters in the novel sequences are fully voiced, the dialogue in the escape portions is the all-too-familiar sound of text-printing blips and squeaks. The implementation of 3D effects is rather haphazard--room escape portions of the game are featured in full 3D, but many other scenes and character models are almost completely flat.        Finally, the way you obtain the bonus archive files that detail some of the game's backstory can be annoying. Each escape sequence has a safe that can be opened with two code combinations: one gives a key to leave, while the other gives a special file containing several archives. Oftentimes the latter is considerably more difficult to acquire, since it typically involves finding a very obtuse second solution to an existing puzzle. You may find yourself torn between leaving a room and proceeding with the story or trying to figure out how to get the extra files; if you leave and try to get the files later, you may be stuck doing the whole escape portion again. Further, you get only a portion of the available bonus files in each room if you play on easy mode, though thankfully, entering the same password to the safe upon revisiting the room on hard difficulty coughs up the missing materials with no effort required.     Among the many games released each year, there aren't many that leave you contemplating and debating their story and worldviews long after the final set of credits has rolled. Virtue's Last Reward takes its place proudly among this crop of games. As fun and challenging as the brainteasers in the room escapes are, they're merely dressing for the fantastic writing, memorable characters, and stunning plot twists that could only be presented successfully in a game format. This is an adventure that anyone who appreciates quality storytelling should not miss.     "
4421,Will of Steel,4.0,0,"  Will of Steel is aptly named, and that's because you'll need a will of steel to get through this lame real-time strategy game about the war on terror. There are so many problems with Will of Steel that it's hard to know where to begin in terms of describing them, but trust us when we say to spare yourself the frustration and avoid this decidedly lackluster game.        Will of Steel features only two single-player campaigns--one set during Afghanistan in 2001 and the other in Iraq in 2003--and both are equally crummy. It's one thing to take liberties with historical facts for gameplay's sake (and many games do), but the campaigns in Will of Steel don't even resemble reality. Despite the fact that the Afghan campaign was pretty much fought by proxy by enlisting Afghanistan warlords to the US cause, the way Will of Steel tells it, the US wages the war with ill-equipped Marine forces battling superior Taliban armies. For example, the Marines in Will of Steel are equipped with weapon systems that have been retired for almost a decade, such as M-60 Patton and M-551 Sheridan tanks. Not that it matters, though, because modern-day armor wouldn't fare any better thanks to the screwed-up weapon balancing that results in infantrymen dishing out far more damage than tanks and other vehicles. Just watch as a single rocket-propelled grenade-toting Taliban unloads a dozen warheads in the time it takes a tank to reload its main gun, and you'll discover the meaning of frustration.     To make things even worse, Will of Steel features brain-dead artificial intelligence and pathfinding, which means that you have to handhold your units constantly to avoid pileups. And even then you'll watch as half of your force arrives at the destination only to get chewed up, while the other half manages to jam itself onto various pieces of terrain, like mountains. The game tries to incorporate some depth, as there are tactical controls, as well as various unit statistics to keep track of, but they're all worthless when it can't even get the basics down right. Plus, you're far too busy trying to get units to untangle to worry about formation controls. But wait, it gets worse. There is no save-game functionality, which means that you've got to start each mission over from scratch each time something goes wrong, and trust us when we say things go wrong far more than they go right in this game. It's so bad that we found that the best way to get through missions is simply to control just one or two units and slowly inch across the map, repairing all the time. It's a grindingly slow and painful pace that's not that much fun. Meanwhile, the game's built-in voice recognition system, which allows you to give verbal commands, is just a gimmick for the most part. While the system does let you quickly select specific types of units, such as engineers, you still have to interact with your keyboard heavily in order to give out orders.     The mission design isn't any better, or any more logical. Despite the fact that the US has detailed, satellite-generated maps of every inch of the planet in case it has to invade a country (not to mention complete control of the air, so it has a bird's-eye view of everything), your minimap is just a plain black grid, so you have no idea what the battlefield looks like until you uncover the fog of war. And speaking of the fog of war, your units can't see anything more than 40 yards away from them, so they'll stumble into ambushes left and right simply because you can't see the enemy. And good luck trying to zoom out, as the camera can't pull back any decent distance, so you're unable to get a big picture of the surrounding area. Even worse, helicopter units literally fill up about a third of the screen because you can't pull the camera back any farther.      Even though the game touts its ""stunning"" graphical effects, Will of Steel is decidedly lackluster in appearance. It simply looks dated in comparison to modern games. There are a couple of nice effects, such as partially distributable environments, but units and buildings are blocky in appearance, textures are murky and muddled, and there's an overall level of blandness. The environments are plain and not very detailed, and everything looks crude. And since you can't pull the camera back, these dull visuals are in your face the entire time. The music sounds like someone's garage band riffing too much on the guitar solos, the sound effects are average, and the voice-overs are bad.        Will of Steel lacks any sort of multiplayer component, so once you're through the game's 16 missions, it's the end of gameplay. Those 16 missions won't take you that long (say about 10 hours), even with the lack of a save-game feature. But those 10 hours aren't going to be much fun, as you'll spend a lot of time yelling in frustration at seeing elite troops run around in circles and get stuck on mountains, while multimillion-dollar tanks are chewed up by a single guy with an RPG. Yes, Will of Steel tries, and it shows some heart, but there are simply so many other better real-time strategy games out there. And if you want to play around with modern military equipment, we suggest you try any of them over this.  "
1341,Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter,6.0,1,"These are all questions Ukrainian developer Frogwares is accustomed to answering, having developed nine Sherlock Holmes games over the past fifteen years. Its last entry, 2014’s Crimes &amp; Punishments, answered these queries more astutely than most by placing the onus of responsibility squarely in the player’s hands. Sure, it may have been somewhat easy to uncover all of the clues with Sherlock’s full range of near supernatural powers at your disposal, but piecing each clue together, arriving at a plausible conclusion, and being confident that you were convicting the right suspect was an altogether different beast. With no wrong answers, it was less a game about rights and wrongs, and more about your interpretation, where Sherlock’s moral compass was your obligation, and you were forced to decide if these people should walk free, spend time behind bars, or worse.The latest entry in the series, Sherlock Holmes: The Devil’s Daughter, takes this unusual premise and applies it to five new Sherlockian tales of intrigue, suspense, and grey moral quandaries. As with Crimes &amp; Punishments, this partition of cases is structurally sound. Without the need to stretch out one case over the length of an entire game, these bite-sized stories are free to move along at a fairly brisk pace, maintaining suspense throughout and hitting satisfying crescendos. There’s some foreshadowing sprinkled throughout that alludes to the titular Devil’s Daughter, but otherwise these are all disparate cases, branching a range of interesting subjects, from peculiar murders, to a deceptive traffic accident, and even an attempt on Sherlock’s life.If you’ve played Crimes &amp; Punishments, locations like Scotland Yard and Sherlock’s flat on Baker Street will be instantly familiar, yet The Devil’s Daughter still resembles a soft reboot of sorts. This is partly due to the sprightly redesigns of both Sherlock and his trusty sidekick Dr. Watson--with Holmes transforming into a bit of a Jon Hamm-alike. Admittedly, this doesn’t change all that much: the writing and voice acting are still decent, with a few notable exceptions (such as the grating caricature of Sherlock’s daughter), and even Sherlock is a little less forthright--a little less of a decorous bore--which makes him slightly more enjoyable to be around. There’s actually a tinge of Robert Downey Jr.’s Sherlock about him, which seems like a conscientious decision when you consider the other ways in which The Devil’s Daughter has tweaked the formula.Devil's Daughter strikes me as a game attempting to push the series forward in a presumptive attempt to attract a more mainstream audience. It’s all a bit triple-A, if not in practice, then at least in spirit. Unfortunately it’s an approach that never really achieves anything but middling results.You can now venture out onto the streets of Victorian London for the first time in the series--passing merchants shilling their wares, or overhearing the downtrodden complaining about the economy--but it’s mostly inconsequential. You’ll occasionally have to find a house or two by following road signs, but you spend most of the game fast-travelling from one location to another (the long loading times will test your patience). While at first this adventure to the outside world seems novel--providing the game with a welcome sense of time and place--it soon becomes an afterthought as early as the second case, and feels like a missed opportunity.In fact, the most meaningful usage of London’s cobblestone streets arrives early in the first case, when you play as young Wiggins (Sherlock’s eyes-on-the-street) and are tasked with tailing a potential suspect through the winding back alleys of Whitechapel. If you’re rolling your eyes at the very thought of a tailing mission, you’re right to do so: this bout of stalking is as bad here as any Assassin’s Creed game. Though, mercifully, it only shows up this one time, which is a common theme throughout The Devil’s Daughter, as mechanics are forgotten just as quickly as they’re introduced.Fortunately, solving cases is often a joy, and is done in a plethora of ways that delve into Sherlock’s idiosyncratic methods of investigation. The basic mechanics work as they have done previously--with a few minor tweaks here and there--and revolve around surveying crime scenes to gather evidence, interrogating suspects and witnesses alike, and using Sherlock’s divine powers of deduction to piece everything together.Collecting evidence is relatively straightforward for the most part, and the locations you visit are beautifully detailed. They’re varied, too--taking you from an opulent bowls club to an illegal gambling den perched on one of London’s ramshackle docks--and sleuthing your way through them is a real treat. Occasionally you need to utilize Sherlock’s Victorian Detective Vision to uncover clues ordinary folk wouldn't notice. And things can also get a little tricky when, say, there’s a lock that needs to be picked, or an ancient Mayan text that has to be translated. These more traditional puzzles are dotted throughout, and put the conundrum-solving part of your brain to good use. A few had bamboozled me on more than one occasion. And if they’re too intricate, or if you only really care about the story, they can always be skipped without penalty.I’ve always enjoyed the interrogation component of crime solving games, and The Devil’s Daughter puts a wonderfully felicitous spin on proceedings. At any time during conversations you can slow down time and zoom in on specific aspects of the person you’re talking to. This allows Sherlock to parse details that you or I may never notice. A sewn patch on a child’s clothing, for example, might look insignificant, but to Sherlock it’s an indication that his parents take good care of him; and that his skinny arms (a sign of malnourishment) aren’t born from negligence, but from a severe lack of income. This is important because, in a very Sherlockian way, you can often catch someone lying by contradicting their statement with a detail you picked up just by observing them. If you’re missing a particular piece of information, you’ll lose out on these opportunities, which injects a welcome dose of meaningful interactivity into what was previously a passive affair.Once you’ve spoken to enough people and gathered the requisite evidence, it’s time to piece everything together and come to a conclusion. This takes place within a literal representation of Sherlock’s mind, with clues depicted as neurons that can be linked together so long as they’re relevant to one another. Link enough clues and this invariably uncovers more clues, until you’re able to reach an outcome that’s consistent with your interpretation of events. And that’s key, remember. There will often be two or more suspects, each with evidence suggesting both their possible guilt and innocence. It’s up to you to paint a picture of the case and come to a decision that you’re happy with. It’s a peculiar way of ensuring Sherlock is always right--and maintains his air of superiority--but it works. If there’s any failing, it’s that this concept robs each case of the satisfaction of knowing you did a good job. Yet, more than any other game of its ilk, it made me think and contemplate my decisions in a way that had me scouring back through all the evidence, just to make sure I was absolutely confident in my answer.Less fantastic, however, are The Devil’s Daughter’s technical shortcomings. Visually, this is a handsome game, but the framerate has trouble keeping up, and screen tearing is a near-constant nuisance. Mechanically, it’s not particularly intensive, so these issues aren’t as heinous as they maybe could have been. But they are noticeable, and, combined with the excruciating loading times, amount to a game that’s not as optimized as one might hope."
857,The Golf Club 2019 featuring PGA Tour,8.0,2,"The first two Golf Club games from HB Studios were capable and compelling golf sims, but they lacked the punch of the official PGA Tour license. Thanks to a new deal, HB Studios now has the license, and this--along with solid, smooth swing controls and fine attention to the small details of golf--helps make The Golf Club 2019 a drive forward for the golf simulation series.The Golf Club 2019 brings six real-world courses to the game, including some of the well-known ones like TPC Sawgrass (home of the Players Championship) and TPC Scottsdale (home of the Phoenix Waste Management Open). The licensed courses are baked into the game's new PGA Tour career mode, with fictional courses filling in the gaps. The six TPC courses are modeled with a fine attention to detail. The famous and dramatic No. 17 at TPC Sawgrass shines in the Florida sun, and I found myself holding my breath teeing it up to the protected island green. The love-it-or-hate-it party hole, No. 16 at TPC Scottsdale, is captured faithfully with its huge stadium-like atmosphere and massive crowds. The Shriners tournament at TPC Summerlin in Las Vegas even includes fezzes as tee boxes just like in real life. If you've seen a broadcast or walked any of these courses in person, they will look familiar. The Golf Club 2019 is a good-looking game, particularly when playing at dusk with sunspots peeking through the clouds. And there is a fine attention to the small details. The distinctive cracking sound of a well-struck drive reflects what you hear on the course in real life and on TV. You'll hear birds chirping and see beautiful vistas of mountainsides, lakes, deserts, and lush forests.That level of realism, depth, and detail doesn't extend to the other aspects of the career mode, however. There are no player likenesses, so don't expect to tee it up as the recently resurging Tiger Woods. Also absent are famous courses like Augusta National and St. Andrews. As a result, The Golf Club 2019's PGA Tour career mode feels limited, especially when only six of the mode's 32 events take place on real golf courses. Although the fictional courses are beautiful, challenging, and diverse, I was left wanting a lot more for a career mode carrying the PGA Tour name. That being said, it was a memorable and challenging journey to advance through the different tours, building skills and experience on the way to the top.It's too bad that the journey to becoming the best golfer is not generally a fun one to listen to. Just like in last year's game, tournament commentary in The Golf Club 2019 is distractingly rough at times. You'll hear the commentary team making out-of-place comments and repeating themselves very often. It almost never feels natural and comes across as forced and contrived, with main commentator John McCarthy speaking in overly hushed, serious tones However, the commentary while playing solo, outside of a tournament atmosphere, is another story. In this more relaxed setup, McCarthy is a delight. He cheers you on and makes polite, playful little jabs when you miss a putt or shank a shot. He even makes groaning, guttural noises when you narrowly miss a putt, and he mimics Borat with a ""Very nice"" quip when you make a difficult shot.As you progress through a PGA Tour season, you'll level up your player and unlock new customization options like clothing and clubs. You also unlock sponsorship tiers and related items after wins, including gear from real-world companies like Under Armour. These rewards, in addition to a rival system that tracks your progress against a fictional player on the tour, give you ample reasons to keep coming back and shoot low scores. It's also nice to see that progression--for the career mode and head-to-head multiplayer--does not include leveling up the attributes of your player. This helps keep everyone on a level playing field, unable to smash a drive many yards longer just because they've played more. Also of note is that the character creator is extremely deep, letting you tweak things like the fine contours on your face and the color of your hair with a wide spectrum of options. Weirdly, the game only offers one shade of darker skin tone, which stands in contrast to the plethora of other personalization options to choose from.On the course, The Golf Club 2019 is the most mechanically sound, challenging, and rewarding golf sim out there. The swing mechanics heavily emphasize tempo. It's a real challenge to make sure you're swinging with the right speed and direction to send the ball where you want it to go off the tee box or with a short iron into a green. One of the most exciting and compelling parts about golf is creating your own shots and scrambling, and The Golf Club 2019 gives you the tools you need to succeed in this regard. The game automatically recommends clubs and shot angles, but these are mostly suggestions on how to play it safe. While there are times when it's important to make safe, normal shots, that isn't always the case and the mechanics are fluid and dynamic enough to give you fine control when you need it the most. Very often you will be in between clubs on a critical approach shot, and your success or failure depends on your ability to dial in the right combination of many distinct elements like height, fade, power, and direction, all of which you manipulate simultaneously. There are also times when you will need to go for a gutsy shot over water or trees, or with draw/fade to get around a corner. It's a thrill when you get this right, and a gut-punch when you don't.Getting to the green is just the start, and putting is where your skills will truly be tested. The game lets you see the undulation of each green, but you must pick a line and judge the speed correctly to send the ball rolling in. Like the two games before it, The Golf Club 2019 earns its simulation nature by being difficult, particularly on the greens. You are punished for poor swings and misreading wind and lies, and the game's most challenging courses will put all of your skills to the test in an experience that can feel frustrating at first but ultimately rewarding when it all comes together. While the game is unquestionably difficult, the swing mechanics and systems for drives, iron shots, and putting, always feel fair. The ball might not always go where you want it to, but you can always reasonably pin your failure on something you could improve.A lot of the animations in The Golf Club 2019 are very good. The way your character's knees buckle when they miss a close putt faithfully captures the pain of that experience many golfers know too well, and. things like body positioning over the ball and the angles and extensions of your character's arms and hands from start to finish appear natural. Unfortunately, there are some problems as well. There is a fist-pump animation you'll see after sinking a nice putt, and while it's effective in capturing the magnitude and emotional expression of the moment, it's the same animation over and over again which eventually makes what should be an exciting moment a boring one. Some of the animations when your player gets in a precarious position, like near the water or on the lip of a bunker, are not very fluid. There are further unfortunate moments of strangeness, including your character standing over the hole when they sink a putt and galleries during competition rounds looking in the wrong direction and acting in unison as they clap and cheer. These weird moments detract from what is otherwise a well-presented package.Another major element of The Golf Club 2019 is its robust course-creator that was one of the signature elements of the first two games. Using a relatively simple and intuitive interface, you can adjust and design almost everything on your course. Want to add alligators next to the tee box on a Par 5 that stretches over water on a blustery day to make the tee off even scarier? Go for it. You can upload and share courses with the community, and the ability to play new and never-before-seen courses will surely keep golf fans coming back for a new challenge.Additionally, the game brings back last year's online-focused Societies mode, which lets you create and join clubs where you and your friends (or the wider public) can compete against other players' ghosts in seasons that run for multiple weeks. There is also head-to-head online multiplayer that, for the first time, now lets you play Skins and Alt-Shot game modes in addition to standard ones like Stroke and Match play. However, as of 10 AM AEST on August 29, I was unable to find any head-to-head online matches on PC.The Golf Club 2019 remains a challenging and ultimately rewarding golf sim with a solid swing system that puts a premium on skill and strategy. The addition of the PGA Tour license is a welcome but limited addition that gives the game a further level of realism and authenticity, while the course-creator again shines as one of the franchise's standout features. Despite its issues, The Golf Club 2019 is the franchise's most attractive package yet."
1861,Disney Infinity 2.0 Edition,7.0,2,"In Marvel comics lore, there's a character named Molecule Man, a ""mostly"" baddie whose immense superpower is nothing less than the ability to control matter at a molecular level and reshape it to his will. The only thing that prevented Molecule Man, whose real name is Owen Reece, from being completely unstoppable was his own subconscious, self-imposed limitations. Owen had all the power in the universe, but often lacked the imagination to use it. I loved playing the first Disney Infinity, but it made me feel like the Molecule Man. The game's Toy Box mode (by far the best part of the Infinity gameplay hydra) seemed to offer endless opportunity to create something. Yet there I was, making boring cityscapes and poorly designed platformers. My partner in Infinity was my then four-year-old son, and even he seemed to sense my creations weren't up to snuff. Son, would you like to have a race on this overly convoluted track I just created? Oh, you'd rather just keep shooting me with that toilet roll gun? I see. Thanks goodness, then, for the improvements introduced in Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes 2.0 Edition. The Toy Box is mind-boggingly complex and option-stuffed as never before, but it's also now much easier to create your own worlds and adventures, with the game featuring assist options that range from ""give me a hand on this"" all the way to ""build the whole thing for me."" The game as a whole still has its share of problems--the main adventure that comes with it is pedestrian, and there are some technical issues that result in sometimes poor frame rates and broken quests--but Infinity's best part has been made even better. My partner again for Disney Infinity 2.0 was my son (now five), and as a lifelong Marvel devotee (thanks in no small part to my constant pushing of the House of Ideas), he was excited to play as some of his favorite characters. The starter pack for Disney Infinity 2.0 contains three Avengers (Iron Man, Thor, and Black Widow), one play set adventure, and two toy box games (which are like genre-specific little mini-games built using Toy Box tools). So that's two less play sets than last year's similarly priced starter pack, and while you can view that as the game providing you less content for the same price, I prefer to see things differently. Like Skylanders (and that other upcoming toys-to-life product from Nintendo, amiibo), Infinity has real world, physical toys that are used to activate their digital versions within a game. One of the problems with last year's Infinity starter pack was that characters were locked to their specific different Disney play set worlds, so if you wanted to play with your kids or friends, you were forced to spend extra money on buying compatible characters. While there's only the one play set in the 2.0 Marvel Super Heroes starter pack, all of the characters that come bundled in can be used, so it's nice to be able to immediately play alongside someone without having to shell out that extra cash. You can, of course, buy other characters separately, so if you do want the whole Avengers crew, be prepared to fork out more money. This new play set is a middling affair, an open-world action game lasting about five or so hours as the Avengers try to stop Loki and the Frost Giants from taking over New York. These themed adventures have always been the weakest parts of Infinity, and this set is no different. You'll find yourself repeating the same types of missions over and over (protect this precious whatsit for two minutes! save these frozen civilians and bring them to the safe zone!), and the open world of New York is pretty lifeless. The streets are filled cars that look exactly the same, the inhabitants don't seem to react to any of the superpowered hijinks happening around them, and there's scant little to do once you finish the main quest arc. The framerate, too, can chug at times, and it's particularly noticeable during co-op. It takes time and actual, honest-to-goodness skill to make anything remotely playable, which makes the new additions to Toy Box in 2.0 extremely welcome ones. But these are grown-up concerns for an adventure that's clearly aimed at pleasing the young. While Skylanders is aimed more at pre-teens and above, Infinity's Avengers seems to skew a little younger, with its simple goals and basic structure probably best suited for those under 10. My five-year-old certainly loved his time with the Avengers, and sharing that adventure with him as we battled countless Frost Giants was an outstanding experience. It was just the right mix for both of us to enjoy--not too hard or puzzling for him to get around, but just tough enough to require me to take the lead in most missions. It helps that the characters themselves--both their physical and digital iterations--are expressive and full of personality. The real world toys are nicely detailed and are quite sturdy (they survived being smashed against each other and being sat on multiple times by a baby in my household), while their in-game counterparts are impressive to play with. Flying around at top speed as Iron Man is a blast, and watching Thor's lightning infused combat strikes never gets old. Poor Black Widow, though; as the only non-superpowered hero in the starter pack, she feels the least fun to play with initially, as the game world just doesn't seem as well suited for characters that can't fly. While Thor and Iron Man can zoom to almost anywhere, unlucky Natasha has to take elevators to reach the tops of buildings. Not exactly the most thrilling entrance for an Avenger. Each character also gets their own specific upgrade tree, and you can use skill points earned as you level up to customise your character. There's a level cap of 20, and you won't be able to buy all the upgrades, which gives 2.0 a welcome yet light customisation feel. Old Infinity characters--and you can use any of them from the previous game--also get this newly added upgrade tree, meaning you'll probably want to dust off that old Jack Sparrow and use him again (and no, old play sets are not compatible with this new game). Even if you don't have a small child of your own (or can rent) that you can guide through the Avengers playset, it's still worthwhile playing if only for the gear and currency you'll get to use in Infinity's standout mode, Toy Box. This is where imaginations get their chance to shine, and the Toy Box is again a wonderfully open-ended experience where you can build a dizzying array of stuff. Want to try your hand at building a race track through Agrabah? Or create a platforming challenge around a series of high-rises? Or even create more complex games like a top-down action-rpg or a collectibles chase? All of this and more is possible. Possible, of course, is the operative word here. It takes time and actual, honest-to-goodness skill to make anything remotely playable, which makes the new additions to Toy Box in 2.0 extremely welcome ones. Some of the new tools available to you include templates that come with everything you need to create specific game types (just hook the individual pieces up and go), non-playable characters that you can drop into empty worlds that will slowly build an entire themed region for you, and even specific pieces that you can stretch and pull to make whatever size environment you desire. In minutes, for example, I was able to create a large, twisting race track that dovetailed around skyscrapers, using only two pieces from the Toy Box. Sure, going on autopilot may seem like the antithesis to the creative possibilities Toy Box opens up. But for me, this helping hand pushed me to try and create more. Gone is that initial befuddlement after looking at the hundreds of options in the Toy Box and not knowing where to start. Gone is the hesitation of devoting hours of time to creating something that may, in the end, suck a lot. Infinity now shows me what's possible, helps me get started, and removes some of the more time intensive parts of creation. And when I see what others are doing--including the the Toy Box games bundled in with the 2.0 starter pack (a decent tower defense-like game set in Asgard and a less successful Diablo-like action-RPG set in the Klyn space prison) and shared community favorites--it makes me wonder exactly what I can achieve, and I'm excited by the possibilities. It's a pity, then, that the Toy Box doesn't escape some of 2.0's technical foibles. Toy Box worlds would sometimes crash during my time with them, and there was one particular mission in Toy Box's tutorial world that seemed perpetually broken. Having to unlock toys and tools, too, is a chore, but it's a manageable one. Playing through the Avengers playset should earn you enough currency to unlock plenty of toys, but you'll need to keep earning those blue sparkles if you hope to have a full range of creative options eventually available to you. My son, though, cared not for such trivialities. He was happy to run around the various toy box worlds, exploring what each new one had to offer, occasionally offering me direction as I Molecule Man-ed my way around. And when he got bored of me trying to create the perfect game experience, he'd sit and play with the physical figurines, lost in his own imagination. Disney Infinity 2.0 is an amazing game to share with a child, and it could be an inspiring one, too."
1869,Hohokum,7.0,2,"  The greatest challenge might come from describing the game itself, though, as most of the worlds in Hohokum are brimming with nonsense. You direct a single serpent, dubbed the “Long Mover,” to sashay from place to place. You can’t attack or communicate with the many people or objects that paint the backdrop, so you’re instead left with no other choice but to bump into things. And once you bump into the right things, a light bulb goes off. Flying over a clay pot sends it crashing to the ground, so what happens if I break all of them? What will that change?         "
2999,Phineas and Ferb: Across the 2nd Dimension,7.0,2,"      The entire game faithfully captures the whimsical look of the cartoon, and seeing what each new dimension looks like, as well as discovering what bizarre elements differentiate it from our own, is part of the fun of this escapade. Clever writing makes these characters a pleasure to spend time with, and though the game is designed for youngsters, parents and older siblings who play along will find that the dialogue is smart enough for them to enjoy, too. (""Technically, the gnomes formed an oligarchy."")             In addition to having sharper, high-definition visuals, the PlayStation 3 version includes four episodes of the TV show, and because both versions are priced at a reasonable $39.99, that's the better option if you have your pick. But you can't go wrong either way. Phineas and Ferb: Across the 2nd Dimension is a good game for youngsters, and it makes great use of its license. Fans of Phineas and Ferb will enjoy this opportunity to jump into the shoes of these resourceful characters, and those who come to this game who aren't fans already just might be by the time they're done.     "
1457,Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash,6.0,1,"Thanks to Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash, I recently set a new personal record: ""Most time spent swearing at a kids' game."" Some of that profanity was good-natured, a product of the competitive tension that lurks just below the colorful, star-studded surface of most Mario sports titles. Some of it, however, stemmed from actual frustration. While Ultra Smash successfully recreates the basic mechanics that earned earlier titles Mario Tennis and Mario Power Tennis critical acclaim more than a decade ago, it fails to solve a handful of underlying design issues and omits much of the content offered by its predecessors.There is, for example, no tutorial mode. There's a rudimentary text tutorial buried so deep in one corner of the main menu that you can't even navigate to it using the Pro Controller, but it's too superficial to prove truly useful. You can easily hit random buttons and figure things out as you go (this is a light, arcadey take on tennis, after all), but eventually, you're going to run up against an AI opponent who crushes you with maneuvers that require a bit more technique. I got destroyed by an embarrassing number of near-unreturnable Ultimate Smashes before I finally figured out how to reliably execute them myself, rather than simply mashing what I assumed was the appropriate button.Throwing players in the deep end and asking them to learn through experimentation isn't an unforgivable sin, but it did lead to plenty of early frustration that could have easily been avoided. Given the time gap between games, even franchise fans like myself need a way to brush up, and new mechanics like jump shots deserve more than a random load screen tip. Generally speaking, games are more fun when you understand how to play them effectively.Unfortunately, basic instruction isn't the only thing missing from Ultra Smash; it also lacks any kind of tournament or career modes. Instead, the game offers only Knockout Challenge, which pits players against every single character one by one, with ever-escalating difficulty. This structure creates a compelling sense of progress, but the mode as a whole yields little reward. Once you make it to 15 consecutive knockouts, you're presented with a congratulatory menu screen and the ""Star"" version of the character you guided to victory--though Star Peach, for example, doesn't look or play any differently from regular Peach. The journey can be challenging, even fun, but after a single trip through the Knockout gauntlet, there's little motivation to grind through again with other characters.That leaves only three main modes, all of which are essentially quickplay variations: Mega Battle, Standard Classic Tennis, and Simple Classic Tennis. Mega Battle includes everything the game can throw at you: Mega Mushrooms that gigantify your character, ""chance shots"" that power up your returns when you execute the correct type of shot from specific glowing spots that appear on the court, and jump shots, which add extra speed and bounce height to the ball. Standard tennis removes the mushrooms, and Simple tennis removes all three power-ups. If you're just looking for some quick tennis action, these three modes provide an adequate fix with minimal hassle. If you were hoping for something more substantial, however, Ultra Smash can't help.In fact, Ultra Smash doesn't even contain the goofy party modes that gave earlier Mario Tennis games both whimsy and variety. Old favorites like Item Battle and Ring Shot--which added some novel twists to the basic gameplay--are simply gone, leaving us with only Mega Ball Rally, which plays identically to the quick-play modes with the exception of its perpetually shrinking ball. It makes for a decent diversion, but because it's so similar to the game's other modes, it ultimately adds little to the overall experience.Even the character roster--though respectably large and packed with all the usual suspects--doesn't create meaningful gameplay variety. While characters in past games possessed unique ""power shots,"" Ultra Smash's 16 competitors play largely the same. Sure, Bowser is noticeably slower than Yoshi and Walugi has better reach than Toad, and those differences did prove noticeable enough that I had to adjust my strategy. But these adjustments were never severe enough to make the core gameplay feel fundamentally different. As with the game’s modes, the character options are adequate, but in no way exciting, inventive, or memorable.As with the game’s modes, the character options are adequate, but in no way exciting, inventive, or memorable.Thankfully, local and online multiplayer stop Ultra Smash from sliding too far into mediocrity. The opponent AI is serviceable--providing a reasonable challenge that'll keep you engaged long enough to hone your skills--but nothing beats yelling in your buddy's face when you counter his sneaky drop shot with an earth-shattering smash. Playing with friends allows the underlying mechanics to deliver those dramatic moments you expect from an intense, high-energy sports game, and thankfully, there's just enough nuance for competition to feel legitimate. You gradually figure out you can counter slices with topspin, deliver jump shots by reaching the ball at the peak of its arc, and crowd the net to force your opponent out of position. As a result, the action is not only fast and fun, it also evokes the ""just one more match"" competitiveness.In keeping with the rest of the game, Ultra Smash's online component is pretty bare-bones, offering only Mega Battle, Standard, and Simple game types with no option to choose a court or play multiple matches against the same opponent. However, the net-code held up fine during my time playing online, so at least you can enjoy all the basics without worrying too much about your internet connection. Local multiplayer is a bit more robust, allowing you to choose any of the eight unlockable court types while throwing Mega Ball Rally back into the mix as well. Plus, as I mentioned, you get to yell in people's faces--which is always a plus.Unfortunately, you may find yourself yelling at the game just as often. For example, you're given almost no warning before Mega Mushrooms wear off and your character shrinks. If you happen to be chasing a ball when that happens, you'll miss your shot simply due to bad luck. Chance shots can also seem confusing and unfair at times. You have no way to conjure a chance shot; they simply appear randomly around the court. Needless to say, it's a little frustrating to have no control over a something that can decide a match--though at least the game seems to use chance shots to level the playing field when matches start to become lopsided. The worst moments, however, are those annoying instances when a ball bounces straight over your head because you simply couldn't tell how high it bounced. It's pretty hard not to feel cheated when that happens."
3335,Lucha Libre AAA Heroes del Ring,6.0,1,"     That's not to say it doesn't know its audience. Heroes del Ring features 31 of the most famous AAA luchadores donning the mask in Mexico today, ranging from the new incarnation of the famed skeleton La Parka to the legendary Gran Apache. These luchadores are divided into the Tecnicos (faces) and the Rudos (heels), providing fodder for an overblown story mode that occasionally makes WWE seem like Shakespeare. If you choose to play as a Tecnico, you spend the game as a promising rookie who tears through every Rudo in an attempt to find out who stole La Parka's championship belt; as a Rudo, you search for the belt among the Rudos in an effort to claim the title for yourself. It's fun stuff, and Heroes del Ring adds a dose of visual excitement by having you fight some matches as one of the other 31 luchadores.      Sadly, these commendable elements can't save Heroes del Ring from the many blows it suffers in the ring itself. Watch any televised match of lucha libre (or, better yet, see one in person), and you'll see that the action never stops. Costumed luchadores brazenly leap from the ropes like electrically charged Mayan supermen at every possible opportunity, and combatants rarely get a chance to get their bearings before the next punch flies from their opponents' fists. Not so here. Lucha Libre's luchadores grunt and lumber about like movie dinosaurs from the 1950s, giving a sense of improbable mass reminiscent of Zangief in Street Fighter II. Where's the speed? Worse yet, in crowded matches involving more than two players, you grow used to inconsistent animations as rival luchadores unrealistically about-face within a split second and trap you in their grasp. This is especially conspicuous in the inferior PlayStation 3 version, which is subject to fairly frequent lockups beginning as early as the loading screen and comes complete with controls that occasionally seem slightly less responsive than those of its Xbox 360 cousin. While the transitions between cutscenes and action are generally fluid, and the graphics seem smoother and even more detailed on the Xbox 360, both versions are subject to the same infuriatingly poor controls.            But at least you look cool. Nothing defines lucha libre (or ""free fighting"") in the popular mind quite like the outlandish masks that luchadores wear to their six-sided ring, and in this regard, Lucha Libre doesn't disappoint aside from an inexplicable limit of four character slots. The masks can be customized according to eyes, nose, mouth, and top and side accessories, along with a virtually infinite range of color options. The rest of your luchador is just as open to stylistic possibilities, with options including body build and accessories and more practical categories such as attributes and moves. With 51 options for facial tattoos alone, it's possible to spend several hours creating the perfect luchador, ensuring that Lucha Libre neatly avoids any worries that you'll come across other players who look exactly like you.   WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011, Lucha Libre's online multiplayer may be pinned for good. Fortunately, Heroes del Ring has an offline Pride mode for quick play that offers the same fairly standard modes as the multiplayer, including one-versus-one, one-versus-two, two-versus-two, one-versus-three, three-way, or four-way. That's not a lot of options, but then again, AAA tournaments tend not to have the variation of their WWE counterparts anyway. Each of these is customizable, allowing you to set options such as handicaps, the type of referee you'll have, the chance of disqualification, and whether a win is earned by pin or submission.       Lucha Libre AAA: Heroes del Ring could have been an innovative and engaging experience, but it's actually a pale and merely passable thematic imitator of better wrestling games. Should developer Immersion have a chance to learn from its mistakes and inject its next game with a hefty dose of true lucha libre speed, a host of attack variations, and more-responsive controls, a sequel could easily make its mark in the WWE-dominated world of wrestling games. As it stands, however, Lucha Libre AAA: Heroes del Ring is a missed opportunity of the highest order.   "
2981,Edge (2011),7.0,2,"     The goal in Edge is straightforward: move your cube from the start point of each level to the end point. Levels are composed entirely of other cubes and squares, creating a three-dimensional grid that you must navigate. You view the action from an isometric angle, and the grid is arranged diagonally. You can move your cube in only four directions, but pressing up does not actually make your cube move toward the top of your screen. Instead, you move diagonally up to the right, and pressing down moves you diagonally down to the left. Because of this orientation, using the WASD or the arrow keys requires a mental recalibration that can be disorienting. Fortunately, you can avoid this issue by using the corner numbers on the number pad (1, 3, 7, 9) or the analog stick on an Xbox 360 controller. No matter which control scheme you use, movement in Edge has a vague clumsiness to it. Part of this is because you are trying to ""roll"" a block around, but your  momentum can be awkward at times. When you move to an adjacent square, you reach a tipping point when your cube turns over. If you push at this point, or linger slightly too long, you might tumble an extra square or two by accident. This could be no big deal, or it could lead to is an extra death or two. Fortunately, death is not punished harshly in Edge, so it's not a big frustration, and for the most part you feel comfortable moving through this cubic world.      The primary challenge is to maneuver through each level safely. Your cube can move along flat surfaces and climb on top of single blocks, but if you come up against anything taller, you know it's time to find another route. Aside from rolling and climbing, your only other ability is grabbing edge time. Edge time is a mid-climb stall accomplished by tapping the key or feathering the stick to balance precariously between one level and another. This allows you to cling to a single edge for as long as you can keep your balance. If you grab edge time on a moving block, it can transport you to a new area. Or if you do it on a wall, you can hang over an abyss as one platform moves out from underneath you and another comes to pick you up. These maneuvers, along with situations that require precision timing, are about as tricky as Edge gets. You'll likely die more than a few times as you get the hang of edge time, but with a little perseverance (and some help from the generous checkpoints), you should be able to proceed without too much trouble.        In addition to simply getting to the exit, you can collect prisms along the way, and later levels use tricky prism placement to create opportunities for light puzzle-solving. It's not always clear how to get every prism, so you have to use all your locomotive skills (and the helpful minimap) to hunt them down. Collecting every prism on each level unlocks some bonus levels, as does beating all the levels, bringing the total level count north of 55. At the end of each level, you receive a letter grade and a score based on your time. Any edge time you earn is subtracted from your end time, but the clock is always ticking, so if you can simply sprint to the end, that's the best way to earn a good score. Grabbing edge time while waiting for a moving platform or thinking about your next move helps keep your time down, but this is worth doing only if you're striving for a place on the online leaderboards.    "
2375,Spycraft: The Great Game,7.0,2,"If the concept of a resolutely straight-faced game developed with actual input from former CIA/KGB members seems just a little scary to you, you'll be all the more prepared for Spycraft,  which is more than a little frightening.  As a CIA operative from “The Farm,” the player must utilize intelligence records and techniques--including satellite photo enhancement, multi-level data analysis, field combat training, image alteration and even interrogation/torture--to root out a group of renegade secret agents who have killed a Russian presidential hopeful and are now after America's Chief Exec.  My head's had just about all the bad-acting-intensive, video-based yawners it can handle without actually imploding, so Spycraft came as something of a relief. The acting is reasonably good, and the game elements are presented in a nonlinear fashion which, while simplified (and still slightly bewildering), presents the realistic, on-your-own flavor of an intelligence operation.   This is not a game whose video segments are mere story-props that leave the player behind, but one designed to keep the player actively involved (sometimes emotionally involved, and that's all this reviewer is gonna give away about that).    Spycraft is a classy piece of work; it's entertaining but at the same time manages never to insult the player's intelligence, unless it's on purpose (“Absolute crap!” is one of the charming evaluations your handiwork may receive over the course of your training.)  A caveat:  Realism, acting and game quality aside, Spycraft is essentially a mystery, and hence has as much replay value as finding your car in a mall parking lot."
4137,Carnival Games (2007),4.0,0,"  Step right up and get your money taken in Carnival Games, a scattershot minigame collection that offers 25 interpretations of real-life carnival competitions. In real life, most of these games are scams. Carnies hoot and holler at would-be suckers to get them to try to win a prize--all it'll cost is a couple of bucks. In the case of Carnival Games, the shady carnie is publisher Global Star Software, and for $40, you can play a variety of games that are typically either too easy or too broken, and rarely anywhere in-between. And your prize for playing? A bunch of virtual toys and a few more mediocre minigames to play. If that isn't a classic carnie scam, nothing is.     The game initially offers up 25 different minigames to play. These challenges run the gamut from skeeball, to target shooting, to knocking over milk containers with a baseball, to the classic test-of-strength game. All of these games use the Wii Remote in one fashion or another. Skeeball is mechanically just like the bowling game from Wii Sports, the ring-toss game has you flicking the Wii Remote as if you were actually tossing a ring, and anything that involves throwing a ball requires you to fling the remote forward in an overhand motion, sort of like passing the football in Madden.         The trouble with all of these games is that none of them are much fun beyond a couple of plays. Some, such as the milk toss and the shooting gallery, are so easy that you would have to have some seriously diminished motor skills to fail. Others, such as the football toss and the ""nerves-o-steel"" game (which has you moving a metal ring over an electrified wire, while trying to avoid getting shocked), just don't feel right at all. They're not impossible, but the controls feel too dodgy to allow for any level of consistent success. Others still, such as the lucky cups game, are utterly strategy-free in that they completely rely on fateful bounces in order to win. A few of the games are just amusing enough to be worth playing multiple times, but most simply aren't.     Your prizes for completing these games are goofy stuffed animals and trinkets that come in small, medium, or large varieties. Getting the better prizes eventually unlocks more variations on some of the existing minigames, but that's about it. You also earn tickets that can be used to play some goofy side-games, such as a love tester or a fortune teller, though the novelty of these runs out almost immediately.     Everything about Carnival Games simply feels lackluster, from the gameplay to the presentation--though especially the presentation. Maybe it's an homage to the ramshackle nature of the carnival itself, or maybe the game just had a teensy budget, but whatever the case, the game looks pretty lousy. At the outset, you can create an avatar to represent yourself. You get the impression that the game was at one time going to use Miis, or was at least heavily inspired by them, because you build the same sort of limbless people. The problem here is that customization is extremely limited, and everyone you make looks either stoned out of their minds or like some kind of mild psychopath. You can give them hard hats, funny shoes, and other bric-a-brac to try to wacky them up, but it doesn't really do the trick. All the in-game graphics are grainy and bland, with artwork and textures that barely compete with some of the GameCube's ugliest games. There isn't much audio in the game at all, save for a few jaunty carnival tunes and a bit of narration from a helpful carnie. What's there is functional, if not impressive.     The Nintendo Wii is chock-full of minigame collections, almost all of them of higher quality than Carnival Games. Sure, it's got variety, and four-player multiplayer, but so does literally every other minigame collection on the system. So why would you pay $40 for a game that would be a stretch to call worthwhile even at a budget price tag? You wouldn't. It's half the fun at twice the price. That's a lousy deal any way you slice it.    "
1700,Ori and the Blind Forest,9.0,2,"The first ten minutes of Ori and the Blind Forest depict a beautiful and soul-crushing story of friendship, selflessness, and loss. They recall the opening minutes of Pixar's Up! in their melancholy, and like in Up!, the introduction provides an emotional foundation for the life-affirming journey that follows. It is a phenomenal opening--a short and wordless tale, playacted by two expressive characters who move with purpose and demonstrate pure affection towards each other. There's a certain elegance to the game's initial sorrow, and it translates to the way you move through this exquisite 2D platformer. Ori and The Blind Forest is, on a fundamental level, structured as so many other platformers are; It springs from the Metroid and Castlevania tradition, gating your progress behind doors that can only be opened once you have learned a particular skill. As the nimble, lemurlike Ori, you leap and flit about with fantastic grace, and as Ori's abilities improve, so do the joys of navigating his world. When you learn how to climb walls, Ori responds wonderfully to subtle movements of the analog stick, allowing you to finesse him into exactly the right place, such as a sliver of stone embedded within a sea of lava. When you earn your double-jump, Ori somersaults like an acrobat and reacts in mid-air to your aftertouch. What a delight to have such fine control over a character this agile. One by one, you learn new skills, and new challenges arrive with them. Ori can fire energy orbs at nearby foes when he isn't avoiding them completely, and those creatures can be difficult to overcome. The blobs that stick to walls and ceilings? They aren't much of a hassle, at least until they coat the surfaces you need to cross and spit acid onto the ground. They won't let you stay still: You must take advantage of Ori's dexterity, by leaping over acidic pustules, jumping from wall to wall, or putting the other abilities you have to good use. For instance, you ultimately learn how to deflect projectiles, aiming them back at your foes while propelling yourself in the opposite direction. Turning an oncoming ball of fire back towards its owner is fun, but if you don't pay attention, you could thrust Ori into a wall of spikes, or into a crow hovering nearby. Propelling yourself through the sky in this manner becomes one of Ori and the Blind Forest's most vital maneuvers. When you first learn it, you typically use the glowing lanterns that dangle from overhangs. Soon, however, you must fire Ori through treacherous areas replete with fiery spheres and those pesky crows, which hurl towards you as if launched from a slingshot. Timing is crucial, as is quickly determining the safest trajectory that still delivers you to your destination. That mid-air fling is at the heart of one of the game's most thrilling scenes: a difficult escape from roaring tides that swallow you whole should you make a single grievous error. The trial and error this scene and others require can prove frustrating if you prefer to move on to the next area rather than discover, learn, and adapt. I admit to shouting a few expletives when unforeseen circumstances cut my attempts short, falling boulders with crystalline spikes covering their undersides and perilous geysers that spurted from the walls among them. But what a feeling it is to overcome these challenges. The tightly timed retreats that close each chapter are among the finest joys in any platformer--or any game at all--released in recent years. If Ori were clumsy, or if these sequences weren't timed so precisely, these moments would be simply annoying. But in Ori and the Blind Forest, each element harmonizes with every other. If you run into trouble, the game's save system eases the pain. You gather crystals as you play that function as checkpoints, allowing you to determine where you will respawn if you succumb to a bile-spewing frog. You must take care, however, not to drop these crystals everywhere you go, since you can only carry so many. Those pulse-pounding escapes are complemented by moments of quiet bliss. In time, Ori can break his fall with a leafy parachute, gliding across the screen like a flower petal on the wind. During these moments, it's easy to appreciate the game's visual artistry. Multiple layers give each environment a lovely sense of depth. As you cross a log that bridges one tunnel to the next, thick trees rise in the background. Embers and fire crackle behind you, giving your trek across the troubled world a sense of urgency and purpose. Luminescent blue plants alternately close and unfurl with each jump, shining and glittering even as they become your next cause of death. It is a fairy tale come to life, a description that has rightfully earned ""cliche"" status--yet rarely is the description so apt as it is in Ori and the Blind Forest. It isn't just the vibrant art and lush orchestral soundtrack that furnish a storybook mood. It's also the story, which is infrequently told to you via subtitles, accompanied by a narrator who chants along in an unknown language, in the style of Okami, or Panzer Dragoon Orta. It is a simple fable about the renewal of a ravaged land; It is in the details that you find the delights worth prizing. A critter that absconds with an important artifact gains importance you don't initially expect, revealing loneliness, fear, and tenderness not with words, but with exaggerated bows and nods. If there is any blight on this atmospheric transcendence, it is the frame rate, which occasionally falters, ever so slightly, in the final hours. It's important, however, not to mistake Ori and the Blind Forest for being simply beautiful. It certainly is--but it is also unceasingly clever. It consistently surprises you with new tricks: gravitational divergences, new ways to move through its spaces, and carefully designed levels that require you to think quickly and respond. It is not as snappy as, say, a typical Mario platformer, seeking instead a broader gameplay arc stretching across a single, interconnected world. It's a superb and thematically consistent approach that allows Ori and the Blind Forest to build joy on a bed of heartache, adding a new layer of mechanical complexity with each ray of hope. Ori and the Blind Forest is featured on our list of the best Xbox games for kids. "
384,Cyber Shadow,7.0,2,"What do you associate with the term ""ninja game""? Perhaps you think of speedy action and superhuman agility, crazy character maneuvers, intense swordplay, or sneaky stealth. Odds are, however, that you also associate video game ninjas with games that are really, really hard. You wouldn't be wrong; in the long history of ninja-themed games, a lot of the standout titles are known for the formidable challenges they present. Knowing that, you'd likely expect a retro-throwback 2D platformer starring a cyborg ninja to be a tough test of your skills. Enter Cyber Shadow, a game that delivers everything above, especially the difficulty.Cyber Shadow puts you in the role of the titular Shadow, a cyborg ninja awakened from stasis in the ruins of a massive city. A mad scientist is on the rampage, having fashioned an army of robotic supersoldiers in a crazed quest to revive the dead, and it's up to you to foil his ambitions. It's a simple premise, but Cyber Shadow's story has a complexity that reveals itself as you progress. As you find the souls of your fallen comrades and discover records of the city's destruction and the lunatic doctor's experiments, you learn of a backstory far more interesting and tragic than a simple “mad scientist gone rogue” yarn.Shadow starts the game quite weak, having simple jumping, slashing, and running capabilities. Thankfully, the first level is a merciful introduction, with plentiful health drops, relatively weak enemies, and lots of checkpoints. But it's not long before things start to ramp up considerably, with early bosses and their bullet-spewing, fast-moving patterns giving you a taste of what's to come very soon. By the second area, you start to feel the pressure--quite literally, as crushing factory debris and instant-kill compactors make it clear that your mission is not going to be a walk in the park.Fortunately, Shadow is very adaptable and can even the odds with the challenges his environments and adversaries present. The world of Cyber Shadow is filled with hidden chambers yielding secret enhancements like permanent life- and spirit-increasing upgrade items, just waiting for the eagle-eyed explorer behind destructible walls and out-of-the-way routes. By defeating bosses and completing certain tasks, you earn new skills that greatly enhance combat and movement: a long-range shuriken, a downward stab, a wall cling, a dash and faster-than-light slash strike. Not only do these skills enhance your ability to combat and evade enemies, but they also open up new areas for exploration in previous areas.But even getting to the bosses that hold these skills can be a trial by fire. To ease the pressure, you can make good use of the game's checkpoint enhancement system. Many of Cyber Shadow's checkpoint terminals have optional boosts you can activate by choosing to spend collected essence points. These enhancements include full health and spirit restores along with robot helper items like a charge cannon and a shot-absorbing drone. Once you pay for the enhancement, it will always be available from that checkpoint--and if you die and respawn, you'll come back with those enhancements in tow. This system adds a level of resource-management strategy to the game while also enabling you to make use of some really cool weaponry that can aid you in facing upcoming obstacles.Even with enhancements, though, getting through the stages requires you to stay alert, figuring out enemy and obstacle patterns while making good use of the skills and resources available to you. There are a lot of great and satisfying ""a-HA!"" moments in Cyber Shadow, where suddenly an inaccessible item or area can be reached with a skill or a difficult enemy can be safely eliminated using a ninja skill or helper weapon wisely.Once you do reach the boss battles, you'll be in for some very fun and challenging fights. These encounters are where Cyber Shadow really reaches its peak, featuring imaginative and unique boss and attack designs that require both fast thinking and reaction to successfully fend off everything that gets thrown at you. Each boss does something new to put the skills you've honed through the stages to the test, and every win feels like a satisfying, hard-fought victory. One boss, the Mekadragon, has a particularly unique gimmick that I won't spoil here, but I know I'll be remembering what a blast that particular fight was for years to come.However, as you get further in the game, Cyber Shadow's stage difficulty begins to take a turn toward being plainly brutal. Strangely, as you get more skills for your attack and movement repertoire, the game puts less and less emphasis on creative combat and reaction, instead relying on obnoxious elements like instant-kill spikes and offscreen enemies in very bad places. At several points in the latter half of the game, I felt like I was being forced to do overly precise and specific actions with absolutely no room for error over and over again until I got things exactly right. The increasingly sparse checkpoints, along with limited health pickups and hazards that have a bad habit of blending into the other visuals, made traversing many of these areas feel like an arduous task. I had to put the game down more than a few times because I was on tilt from dying repeatedly in certain areas, sometimes only noticing an inconspicuous instant-kill spike after my death.While you can go back to earlier areas to find upgrades to make the late game a little bit easier, the way Cyber Shadow handles backtracking is quite messy. There are limited warp terminals in the game, and you'll sometimes go far very long stretches without seeing one. You can always attempt to backtrack the long way, as many of the stages are interconnected, though the ways they intersect are confusing--and the game's limited map does little to help. A more detailed map system would have done wonders in assisting players with exploration and finding all of the game's hidden areas and items, as well as making the world feel a bit more cohesive overall. It makes exploration more of a chore than it should be, and that's unfortunate.Cyber Shadow is a solid retro throwback with a few things that drag it down. The feeling of becoming more powerful and being able to take down huge enemy threats with your wits and skills is very rewarding, and the levels when you can use your abilities more freely to overcome challenges are quite fun. It's the trial-and-error areas littered with cheap deaths, demanding exact precision over long and frustrating stretches, that hamper the experience. Still, if you're looking for an old-school-styled ninja game that will test your skills (and sometimes your patience), Cyber Shadow is a worthy contender."
386,Warframe,8.0,2,"Update (February 1, 2021): Digital Extremes' Warframe is out on PS5. This current-gen version of Warframe sticks closely to its PS4 counterpart, even offering cross-save and crossplay functionality between both versions of the game. What's new with the PS5 edition are improved visuals that run at 4K and 60fps and added haptic features with the DualSense controller. This in turn gives a greater sense of visual and gameplay feedback in combat and the general action of the space-faring adventure, which is one of the most compelling aspects of playing Warframe."
4128,CSI: Crime Scene Investigation: 3 Dimensions of Murder,4.0,0,"  CSI: 3 Dimensions of Murder was originally released on the PC nearly a year-and-a-half ago. So why, exactly, are we getting a PlayStation 2 port of it now? This half-hearted, crime-solving adventure game based on the hit TV show didn't offer much more than the same rudimentary take on semen-stain swabbing and footprint photography that the previous CSI games had produced. Not to mention that it had a bad habit of telegraphing the identity of the murderer long before the case was closed. Now it's on the PlayStation 2, and it's every bit the snoozer it was on the PC, only with grainier, darker visuals and a more cumbersome interface.        The premise of 3 Dimensions of Murder will be immediately familiar if you've played any of the previous CSI games. You're a new recruit in the Las Vegas Crime Scene Investigation unit. At the beginning of each case, you're given a crime scene and a cast member from the show to pair up with. They primarily act simply as a mouthpiece, given that you're the one doing all the investigating and evidence collecting. The cases presented in 3 Dimensions of Murder generally revolve around, of all things, murder. You'll find a dead woman on the floor of an art gallery, an apartment drenched in blood (but with no body to be found), and even a gunshot victim found on the floor of a demo booth at the fictional Las Vegas equivalent of E3.      In fact, the best part of 3 Dimensions of Murder is that it does go to some lengths to throw in some inside jokes about the video game industry--primarily in the specific case mentioned above. For example, marketing people talk about how great games that don't sell are failures, and weak games that do sell are winners; there are random digs at the proliferation of sex and violence in games (slightly ironic for an M-rated adventure); and there's even a fictional, canceled game series starring a cartoon duo that's highly reminiscent of Sam &amp; Max.     However, there are two problems with all of this. One, the CSI games aren't targeted at the kind of hardcore players that would even begin to understand what any of these gags mean, and two, that case is the only one with any cleverness behind it. The rest of the cases travel the same roads of murderous intent that have been seen both in the show and in the previous CSI games, and it's not done with much flair or creativity.      If anything, the cases follow a pretty predictable path of logic. Although the evidence is never the same twice, the timeline for suspects is. There are always three suspects in any case, and eventually you'll get warrants to bring them all in. The third one you bring in is always the guilty party. Sometimes the game will loop back around and try to point you in the direction of other suspects, but it always comes back to that third suspect in the end. Before you start screaming about spoilers, the fact is that such a predictable line of storytelling is practically a spoiler in and of itself. Is it some kind of lame tie-in to the fact that it's the third Las Vegas game, and that there's a 3 in the title? Did someone actually think this was clever? Well, it's not, and it's the sort of thing you'll pick up on by the second or third case, whether or not you read this review.     On top of the case predictability, there's simply not too much that's interesting about any of them. The case in the not-E3 trade show is kind of amusing mostly because of the inside jokes, and there is an interesting conclusion to the case involving the blood-soaked apartment, but that's about it. The red herrings the developers try to give you don't do anything to throw you off the obvious conclusions about who did what for which reason. The last case in particular seems like a fairly desperate attempt to try to tie previous cases together into one big, grand finale, but it just feels labored and unnecessary. Plus, it's possible to break the continuity of the story flow from time to time. If you miss an obscure piece of evidence, sometimes the story will continue on, giving you details you won't have the set-up for without that piece of evidence. Once you go back and find that wayward piece of evidence, the set-up for that story bit will then come after you've already heard the next part, which is disjointed to say the least.        Furthermore, the interactions with the characters aren't very engaging. The voice acting is mostly good (at least, from the suspects and other non-CSI types), but there's a lot of it, to the point where characters will sometimes repeat lines and ramble on about nothing of consequence. The cases in this game are certainly longer than the previous CSI games, but not because there's a decidedly higher amount of investigative work to do--they're longer because the suspects just won't shut up.     The investigative work in 3 Dimensions of Murder isn't much different from what you would experience in the other CSI games, with the expecption of the PS2 game's clumsy control scheme, of course. You poke around a crime scene, or a suspect's residence, and look for evidence that points you toward the truth. When you collect evidence, you can swab for blood, dust for fingerprints, run UV lights to look for semen stains, and just rummage around for any trace evidence that might be hidden. At the crime lab, you can do even more: run computer searches for prints, DNA, chemical makeups of unknown substances, ballistics matches, and the like. There's plenty to do, but once you have a basic grasp of how the evidentiary process works, you'll find that there's not much to it. When you pick up a sizable object, always look for stains or fingerprints, and odds are you'll find something. Whenever you find a print, some blood, or anything with DNA, always run it against other samples you have or search through the database. It's basically busywork, although it is somewhat satisfying to watch as the evidence you're collecting paints the picture of what went down.      But again, this is all pretty easy to do and quite predictable in nature. On the default difficulty, it's extremely easy to find evidence, and you can always grab hints from the CSI you're working with if you ever get stuck. Asking for hints docks you on your postcase evaluation, but that evaluation doesn't actually do anything except change the rank you're given at the end of a case. Higher difficulties make it tougher to find stuff, but if you've ever played a crime-solving adventure game before, you'll still know where to look. The main quirk about the game on the PS2 is that sometimes the game just doesn't seem to want to zoom in on evidence no matter how many times you press the X button. Cycling through your locations using the D pad isn't the most enjoyable thing in the world, either.     CSI: 3 Dimensions of Murder was the first in the series to use fully 3D environments and characters, but the shift in graphical style didn't made the game look better in any way, nor did it make the evidence-detecting process any different. You don't freely walk around environments looking for stuff. Rather, there are hot spots and areas you can move to, and you can't go anywhere beyond the limits of those hot spots. The environments look decent enough with the 3D graphics engine, but the character models have taken a decisive step backward. Faces look blurrier and less detailed than they did in previous CSI games, bodies look a little stubby and weird, and the animations of the characters are just as minimal as they were in the old games. On top of those issues, the PS2 version is just drab and dark-looking. It's as if the developers removed practically every light source in the game to get it to run on the PS2, and scaled back all the character and environmental textures to boot. This makes searching for stuff more of a hassle because you'll often have trouble seeing in the near pitch-black of some of the crime scenes.        The presentational issues don't end there--the bulk of the show's cast is on hand for this game, but Marg Helgenberger and Jorja Fox are nowhere to be found. Worse still, the replacement actresses are awful. Both try way, way too hard to emulate the vocal inflections of the two actresses, and they come off sounding pained in the process. William Petersen and Eric Szmanda are the lone bright spots of the regular cast, given that Gary Dourdan and George Eads sound like they couldn't be more bored to be there.     CSI: 3 Dimensions of Murder certainly has its moments, but like every other CSI game to date, those moments are easy to get to, and ultimately unsatisfying because of the light amount of effort it took to arrive. The relative ease of this game, combined with its extremely late arrival on the PS2, the relatively shoddy porting job, and the fact that there's already a sequel to this game out on the PC and Xbox 360, makes 3 Dimensions of Murder feel even more irrelevant than it did upon its initial release. Not that any of the CSI games are wholly recommendable, but 3 Dimensions of Murder on the PS2 is one to especially avoid.    "
3291,Get Fit With Mel B,6.0,1,"  UK REVIEW--Get Fit With Mel B is a fitness game, where ""game"" is understood to mean ""something that runs in an Xbox 360 but won't run in a DVD player."" Closer to the mark would be ""interactive celebrity fitness video,"" since there's not much to it that's game-like (that is, playful or competitive), though it does ostensibly know, via the magic of the Kinect, whether you're replicating Mel B's movements or not. In this respect it is functional, if not fine-tuned. Likewise, the presentation is passable, but no more than that; it's cheap and cheerful rather than slick.        You start out by entering your gender, date of birth, height, and dietary requirements. You also pick the build that most resembles yours from a set of silhouettes, along with primary and secondary fitness goals from a wide selection, ranging from the predictable (losing weight) to the specific (getting fit to play golf or getting ""arms like Mel's""). Here, as in the rest of the game, menu selections are made with the point-and-hold method that's prevalent among Kinect titles: use your hand to hover over an option and hold it there while an icon fills. It makes the brightly coloured, large-buttoned menus easy to operate but slow and languid-feeling. Something livelier, such as Dance Central's select-and-flick method, would better suit a motion-sensitive fitness game. Once your profile is set up, the game generates a customised daily workout: a routine of exercises compiled from the game's master set of 200, which include dance and combat-style moves alongside the standard jumping jacks, squats, and crunches. The automatically generated daily workout can be tweaked--you can alter your goals and the length of the session--or you can ignore the daily routine altogether and build yourself a workout from scratch. On completion of a workout, you're asked if you found it too easy or hard, to let the game adjust the difficulty of selected exercises for you. If you've got a resistance band, weights, or an exercise step at home, there are also exercises to include these in your workout--a nice addition for the home fitness enthusiast who has already amassed a collection of workout accessories.      The green-screened Mel B, former Spice Girl and reality-TV star, appears in your workout to demonstrate the exercises. Your Kinect-captured image is placed on a mat beside her to copy her moves, with both of you backed by your choice of cheesily rendered location--luxury yacht, apartment, Central Park, and more. As you follow Mel, a gauge fills or empties according to how closely the Kinect thinks you match her, and a counter records how many reps you and Mel have each performed. The tracking appears to be based purely on your silhouette rather than on the more advanced Kinect skeletal tracking system, and it's not entirely convincing; a rough or lazy copy of Mel's movement will often do the trick, and you can sometimes pick up a few reps by just jigging about. But you can't cheat it altogether, and it knows when you've totally given up (Mel: ""Having problems?""). If you do put the effort in, you will work up a sweat--you're doing several reps of genuine exercises, after all--but it doesn't help that new exercises aren't really described. Mel B isn't so much an instructor as a demonstrator, with her ever-present voice-over offering only vague instructions (""crunch!"") and generic encouragement (""yeah!""). You can pause the workout to enter a tutorial mode that is only slightly helpful and misses the point of an instructor-led workout. At least seeing yourself working out on the screen provides useful visual feedback--it's an upgrade on a workout video and a mirror--and it will be an amusing novelty for some. If you don't want to watch yourself sweat, though, you can choose to appear as a coloured silhouette or an outline instead.        At the end of a workout, you're told your percentage completion mark, the number of calories burned, and the number of fitness stars to add to your cumulative score. The latter, along with a medal for completing multiple workouts, is your incentive to persevere. There's nothing competitive on offer, and there are no minigames or race modes--it's just you, Mel, and your workouts. The supposed challenges (Abs Attack and Legs of Steel) are just targeted workouts. If you were wondering where those dietary requirements come in, it's in the nutrition section, where Get Fit With Mel B generates a daily food plan to go with your daily workout. The food plan suggests your meals for the day, with a shopping list and recipes, but it's a text-heavy, feature-poor, perfunctory addition that wouldn't satisfy a fitness or diet enthusiast, with no calorie count and no nutritional information. At a push, it might be useful if you really, really can't think of something to make for dinner.    "
2903,The Cursed Crusade,3.0,0,"   full of exposition, with cutscene after cutscene breaking up the action, but the plot never really goes anywhere. There are no twists and no major developments until the very end; thus there is little to warrant the two hours of cutscenes within the game.    300, Denz's character model simply failed to load, making it farcical for all the wrong reasons.      Weapons are collected as you go, and there are a large number of combinations. Denz and Esteban can use swords, axes, maces, spears, and shields, which can be mixed and matched. Two-handed weapons provide heavy attack power, a weapon used with a shield provides good defense, and dual-wielding provides some nippy attacks that are low on damage but high on speed. Enemies have different armor levels, and you can guard break, dodge, parry, and riposte. There are also a series of finishing moves that can be unlocked for each weapon combination by spending victory points. Victory points are earned for completing levels, as well as completing optional objectives in each level, such as purifying a number of souls, cleansing a crucifix, or finding hidden coffers.      Initially, the combat seems quite deep, but it quickly falls apart. For starters, weapons break and have to be maintained. This isn't inherently bad, but a number of issues make this highly problematic. Swords break far too frequently, often after just a couple kills, which leads to a frantic sprint as you look for the prompt that tells you you're standing on another weapon. They're often difficult to see, and if enemies are following, then you have no hope of actually spotting a weapon on the ground. To make matters worse, there's no indication that you've actually picked up a weapon, and sometimes, the blade simply disappears. Even more awkwardly, the characters slip and slide around due to input lag, and accurately standing on the weapon you're trying to recover is tricky in the heat of battle.        This is a shame because each weapon has a different weight, and they all appear to be historically accurate. Occasionally, you may find yourself in a fight where there are no weapons to replace your broken one, so you have to fight with a hilt or a stick until you can find another. This means that you can do almost no damage to your opponent, which causes a severe and unwelcome difficulty spike in the later stages of the game. What's more, every fight is very similar, save for the number of enemies present. Even boss fights recycle ideas, with one particular boss fight repeated three times through the game with only minor variants to the formula. Combos are largely useless because of the unresponsive controls, so mashing the light attack button and countering occasionally is by far the best way to get through everything. Toward the end of the game, a different type of enemy is introduced, but you still never do anything more than hack away at an armored foe. The regular fights are made worse by the awful enemy AI. Combatants frequently get stuck in scenery, causing you to run around and look for a soldier stuck behind a tree before you can proceed.    what you're meant to be shooting at because the targets are almost out of camera shot.       The camera pans around your character, but sometimes, it switches to a fixed perspective. This often causes Denz to run in the wrong direction before the game catches up, and it sometimes means you are obscured by a castle wall as you try to fight. There's an option to turn the fixed camera off, but it certainly doesn't turn the fixed camera angles off. Likewise, there's a manual lock-on option that seemingly does nothing, with the characters automatically locking on to enemies regardless of whether you set it to ""yes"" or ""no."" There's also a bizarre menu glitch that occasionally causes the sound levels to default to zero upon booting the game. Then there are the glitches that cause your characters to get stuck in the scenery, forcing an entire mission restart, which is especially infuriating when you have to repeat boring sections of gameplay.      Being cursed, Denz and Esteban also have the ability to shift into Hell. This makes enemies slightly weaker and also allows you to use certain powers of the curse: healing, throwing fireballs, shooting fireballs, and stamping on the ground to produce fireballs. Much like everything else in The Cursed Crusade, the fireballs are a bit useless and mostly exist to let you break parts of the environment to proceed. In Hell, you can also see hidden exits, which is the game's excuse to make you run around a large area for a while until you happen upon a slightly glowing bit of wall. None of this is fun; neither is trying to use the healing power in single-player. Most of the time, it simply doesn't work, with Denz swinging his sword impotently. What you really want him to do is engage in the weird dance/fist bump combo that he and Esteban do to recover their health. It's a little easier in co-op because the other player can remove their character from the action to a safe distance, but only a cruel friend would ask someone to endure this with him or her.      The co-op mode is playable online or in split-screen, but it adds nothing to the game other than having someone to sympathize with you as you scramble for weapons; get stuck in scenery; or stare at a church pew that is floating, in pieces, in midair. There are occasional switches or levers that require two people, and some finishing moves can be performed cooperatively, but it's not the kind of game that is vastly improved with another player. The only benefit is that you can guarantee your partner will actually attack enemies, which isn't always true when he's controlled by the AI.     The Cursed Crusade isn't a good-looking game, with some dreadful clipping issues, muddy textures, and a noticeable lack of anti-aliasing. There's even an area where the heroes navigate a lengthy maze of empty rooms because they refuse to step off of a foot-high ledge. To add further insult, just as Denz and Esteban are heading to what seems like the final confrontation, the game simply ends in the middle of a cutscene in an awful attempt at a cliffhanger.        The Cursed Crusade struggles in all areas. The combat is sluggish and awkward, the exploration is unrewarding because of the invisible walls that block off areas or refuse to let you return to previous sections, and the story is nonsense. Given that a far better cooperative hack-and-slash Templar game, The First Templar, was released earlier this year, The Cursed Crusade hasn't got much to offer. In the US, this is a budget game, but in the UK, it's a full-priced release. Even at a lower price point, though, this is one curse that is not worth breaking.    "
1910,TrackMania United,8.0,2,"   If you decide to download this game from Steam (the only place it's available in the US), be aware that this a racing-game throwback--not the usual hardcore sim with a capital ""S"" that you tend to get on the PC. Ripping around and having a blast is the point here, not running telemetry until you can blow the doors off everyone at Daytona. Vehicle types here come with loose physics and a slidey feel more fitting of toy cars than of real hunks of metal and plastic. Cars even bounce when they fall from great heights, whether they hit pavement or water when they come down. Tracks are even more fantastic, typically featuring insane jumps, hoops hovering in midair, snowboard-style half-pipes, precipices high above desert canyons, and tropical-island highways that come to abrupt dead ends. And if you can think of a design even nuttier, you can make it yourself with the powerful, easy-to-use track editor.         But while races and the challenge of besting online times will hook you, platform mode will keep you coming back for more. This fiendishly addictive game (a revamped take on Sunrise's ramps tracks) challenges you to simply make it from start to finish without hitting a checkpoint restart too many times, but that's easier said than done when you have to deal with jumps that don't line up, holes that drop you into watery graves, tunnels that whip you around like a pinball, and outrageous one-after-the-other leaps to floating platforms suspended in midair. These tracks beautifully balance learning with driving skill. Even after you've run through a track a few times and memorized its pitfalls, funky driving is still required in order to stay on the road. This means a lot of trial and error...along with a lot of laughing as you continuously miss turns and cinematically sail off ramps to plummet hundreds of feet into the drink in front of gorgeous sunsets. Swearing alternates with the laughter, though, as getting a gold medal requires perfection, and perfection is gamepad-throwingly hard to come by.       But while puzzle makes you question what the developers were thinking, the visuals make you ask how the heck they managed to make a game look this good and run this fast. Frame rates fly on even a low-end machine, and tracks load in seconds (restarts are instantaneous), even though the appearance of the game hasn't been compromised at all. Tracks are designed around postcard vistas like tropical beaches, historic countrysides, and snowy cliffs. Big jumps often trigger the camera switching to a panoramic view of the action, further emphasizing the attractiveness of the backdrops and adding a < Fall Guy feel. In-game advertising is the only sore point. When you're logged in online, the scenery is marred by billboards. It's not like tracks are clogged with signage, though, and the ads are region-specific (in Canada, for instance, you get billboards for Rogers and those irritating Bell Canada beavers), so you might see something of interest. Still, having to endure commercials in a retail game is every bit as galling as having to sit through ads in movie theaters.     Audio quality almost makes you forget about the annoying sales pitches, at least. Atmospheric effects are dialed way down for what should be an over-the-top arcade game with lots of squeals and smashes, although the selection of great tunes on the soundtrack mitigates this minor issue. Each song matches its setting, so you get a nifty country honky-tonk in desert races, a scratchy hip-hop beat in the city, and so on.     Overall, TrackMania United has a dreamy, fantasy vibe that could fulfill a kid's slot-car dream. Veterans of the previous two games in the series might find it too much of a been-there, done-that sequel, but it's perfect for anyone who appreciates speed, imaginative track design, and a definitively offbeat take on running cars around in circles.

3492,Wumpus,4.0,0,"  What is a wumpus? A scary purple monster that lives in a cave, of course. Unfortunately, as the chief field worker of the zoological society, it's your task to explore a dark cavern to learn more about the monster's ecological needs. So, armed with a single tranquilizer dart (due to lack of funding), into the cave you go.               This review was provided by GameSpot mobile content partner SlideToPlay.com. "
4892,Cyberball 2072,2.0,0,"  Cyberball 2072 is robotic football, in which giant machines attempt to score touchdowns while hopefully not blowing up. Of course, staying intact is a little harder than it sounds, given that the ball in Cyberball is a bomb. The 1989 release came in an interesting cabinet that actually contained two arcade machines in one case. Two linked monitors let four players play the game at once in two-on-two play. If you were into competitive arcade games back then, it was absolutely awesome. But after playing the butchered version that's been foisted on Xbox Live Arcade for five bucks, you'll probably wonder why anyone ever cared about such a dull game.        Cyberball 2072 isn't crippled by its age. Its joystick-and-one-button gameplay holds up reasonably well. Instead, the problem lies with how the game has been emulated. Rather than find a way to properly emulate the original arcade experience by letting players compete, the developers decided to emulate only one machine. You can play two-player games, but only in a cooperative mode that puts both players on the same team. There's just no way to play this game competitively against another human, not even via Xbox Live.     Without the ability to play against another player, this game has a shelf life of almost zero. The computer teams aren't difficult to beat, especially when you're playing with a friend. There's also a ""game breakers"" mode, in which you have to use specific plays in specific situations to move on; three botched attempts end the game. That'll keep you busy for around 30 minutes or so, given that the game lets you continue as many times as you want, just like the arcade version did.     To add a little insult to injury, some of the game sounds often get stuck and loop infinitely until you hit the pause button, which kills all of the game's sound when you unpause. This gives you the impression that the audio isn't being emulated at all, but rather triggered by samples. Some of those looped sounds get pretty grating, so you'll find yourself pausing and unpausing four or five times a game, just to correct the audio.     It's pretty disgusting that this game was released in such a pointless state. In its intact form, Cyberball 2072 could have been a really awesome download, and the four-player mode could have been outstanding online. Instead it's a missed opportunity and a waste of five dollars. Don't play this game.  "
4585,Silent Debuggers,4.0,0,"  At first glance, Silent Debuggers for the TurboGrafx-16 looks like a sci-fi rendition of Eye of the Beholder. At second glance, you'll realize it's just a clunky, choppy, repetitive grind that's just about no fun to play.     In the game, you play the role of a bounty hunter that has to eliminate the aliens occupying the six floors of a space station before the security system blows the station to bits. While a funky, beat-filled soundtrack plays in the background, you'll need to pay attention to the onscreen radar and the text clues provided by your partner in the control room to find the rooms where the ugly beasts are holed up. At that point, you'll mash the attack button and trade blows until, hopefully, your alien opponent explodes in a flourish of pixilated guts. From start to finish, 100 minutes is all the time you have to wander the halls, blast aliens, and make frequent trips back to designated recharge rooms to replenish your shields and weapons.        Your movements and those of your enemies are very limited. Pushing up or down on the control pad will cause you to move forward or step back one whole room, and tapping left or right will rotate your view in 90-degree increments. If you encounter an enemy, it'll either stay put in the middle of the screen to hack away at you, or move straight back to avoid you. You have the same two options: shoot or back up. There's no strafing or ducking. As you'd expect, mindlessly mashing the attack button gets boring real fast, especially because the rooms on each floor of the station all look alike, apart from the color of the walls and the occasional sign marker.     Simplicity aside, the worst thing about the game is that it's literally a pain to watch. The beautifully drawn anime-style opening scenes give way to a flickering, choppy mess that will make your eyes and head hurt if you play for too long. When you walk or turn, the view doesn't change smoothly. Instead, one static 3D scene is quickly replaced by another, with only one or two intermediate frames in-between. A typical enemy attack consists of two alternating frames that show the creature's claws or mouth ""moving."" If you can imagine walking down the street while rapidly opening and closing your eyes, that's what playing Silent Debuggers feels like. It's not a comfortable feeling. It's certainly not worth the 600 Wii points.  "
1498,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,9.0,2,"Of all the things Civilization: Beyond Earth's first expansion accomplishes, the greatest is this: it sorts through centuries of war, politics, and future technology, to reveal the personalities behind it all.Developer Firaxis Games has a reputation for making bold expansions, and Rising Tide is no exception. It doesn't just add content to the sci-fi strategy game--it reimagines certain systems altogether, and brings real characters into the formula. And despite a few cloying issues, Rising Tide's changes make for a more balanced, and more memorable, empire-building experience.As in Beyond Earth, Rising Tide puts you in the throne--or council chamber, depending on the leader you choose to be--as you guide your civilization to victory on alien planets in the distant future. The chariots and compound bows of human history are absent. This is a world of exo suits, plasma weapons, and sterile, bulbous architecture. There's a sense of otherworldliness here that earlier Civilizations don't contain.Although there are still five paths to victory, both peaceful and otherwise, the methods of reaching them have changed. For the first time, Rising Tide lets you colonize the seas. So while naval combat and exploration are still key factors in any smart ruler's strategy, this expansion brings cities--complete with all their commerce, resources, and hardworking people--into the waves.This feature would be novel enough on its own, but Firaxis wasn't content to duplicate land tactics in a maritime setting. In Rising Tide, ocean cities can move. It takes a few turns, depending on the city's production rating, but these floating metropolises can travel across water, one hexagonal tile at a time, in any direction you choose.The result is a dichotomy between your thinking on land and your approach at sea. While continental settlements still grow out from the center, forming clean circles of multicolored tiles, oceanic territories take on a snaking, amorphous shape in their search for better resources.And because citizens can still only work tiles within three spaces of the nearest city, building a seafaring province can mean dealing with loss: short term gains are far more valuable at sea, where resources are ephemeral, and cities might abandon farms, generators, and academies in an instant.Floating metropolises can travel across water, one hexagonal tile at a time, in any direction you choose.My first floating city, for example, landed in the center of a great lake. But as the years passed and my people developed new technologies, I moved it up along the coast, where clusters of Firaxite deposits increased my naval unit production.Then, 150 turns later, with my Deep Space Telescope sailing through the stars, I prepped my civilization for the final stages of a Contact victory. I moved my city back down along the coast, toward a more defensible area with mountains at my back. I knew enemy armies would come with advanced weapons of their own, and ocean cities have lower defense ratings than their land counterparts. Holding out for victory while I built my alien beacon would not be easy.And just like that, my prediction rang true: all of my allies declared war. One by one, I watched my longstanding relationships deteriorate through Rising Tide's new diplomacy system, a feature which, in the grand scheme of things, is just as significant as sea colonization.Through this new diplomacy system, you strike international deals, manage alliances, and change your own leader's personality traits by spending diplomatic capital. Much like culture or energy, this resource accumulates through various perks and buildings, as well as through deals with other leaders.Those figures will, in turn, come to fear or respect you. Build up a big enough army and they'll accept your deals in awe. But manage your civ with a wise leader's acumen, and surrounding dignitaries will join out of admiration. This leads to alliances, new relationships to leverage, and easier deal propositions. If a leader doesn't have a strong opinion either way, they'll be harder to sway.This diplomacy system remedies several complaints I had with Beyond Earth. First, it adds dynamism to otherwise boring mid-game turns. Beyond Earth is a more nuanced experience throughout, and managing deals and personality traits in pursuit of perks creates more involved playthroughs.But this feature does something more: it injects personality into Beyond Earth. The leaders develop unique idiosyncrasies, growing into angry tyrants or peaceful visionaries. They turn jealous when I make deals with their enemies. They scoff when I refuse their own. And after a while, I developed opinions about each one of them. I respected Daoming. I ignored Duncan Hughes. I despised Rejinaldo.Leaders develop unique idiosyncrasies, growing into angry tyrants or peaceful visionaries. They turn jealous when I make deals with their enemies. They scoff when I refuse their own.By offering insight into my strategy, and reacting based on existing relationships, these commanders exhibit believable choices at the futuristic round table. I considered interactions in a more careful manner, afraid I might tip the scales if I pushed too hard.However, it's often unclear why a ruler approves or disapproves of your actions. This is important, because it's these opinions that affect their standing toward your nation. At one point, Rejinaldo, Brasilia's leader, laughed at my production rates, only to compliment them once I raised them a mere two points higher. It seemed opaque, and Rising Tide didn't offer any quantitative explanation for the man's change of heart. Less robotic AI is welcome, but less logical characters is a step too far.There can also be an overload of information farther into games, when every ruler sounds off on each move I make. The constant chime sometimes diminishes much of the impact these comments had in the first place.But these characters still feel genuine. This isn't the level of characterization you'll find in a role-playing game or story driven experience, but when Brasilia's hardheaded leader formed a blockade across my main trade route, refused any offer of peace, and picked off my workers one by one, he elicited real anger from me. It wasn't frustration with the game, or even with ""that militaristic tyrant who's disrupting my energy supply."" It was frustration with Rejinaldo."
2263,Race the Sun,8.0,2,"  Glide right, glide left, or fly straight ahead. These are your only options when you first dare to race the sun. As a swift ship (that also looks like a swift), you automatically speed ahead under solar power. You must maneuver to avoid obstacles and stay out of the long shadows of tall objects, lest your craft lose power and slow to a halt. Yellow pickups give you a temporary speed boost and raise the sun slightly higher in the sky, but that bright orb is always descending, and when it sets beyond the horizon, your run peters out.   The core mechanics are simple and slick; you move with a gliding elegance, barrel-rolling automatically when you drastically change your lateral momentum. A mellow soundtrack and a constant low hum accompany you as you whip across the barren landscape dodging polygonal obstacles. Spheres, blocks, and cones form the rudimentary landscape, and though you can graze or sideswipe an object and still forge ahead (after taking a speed penalty), a solid collision brings your run to an abrupt end. As you progress through regions, the obstacles grow more complex and move about more often, while the soundtrack ups the tempo and starts to exert pressure of its own.   And so you wind your way back and forth, snagging pickups and dodging objects while constantly speeding forward. Race the Sun's difficulty ramps up rather quickly, requiring deft movements and smart terrain scouting and giving you less and less time to react. After you fail numerous times, the challenge set before you may seem too great, but Race the Sun does a few things to avoid causing despair. Every day, the course changes. These are procedurally generated worlds, so while you see plenty of familiar obstacles (like those infernal tunnels), the change of layout freshens things up significantly.     And at about $10, Race the Sun is an appealing package. The smooth sensation of flight through the austere landscape is both relaxing and intense, bringing with it the joy of escaping danger and the agony of meeting with disaster. Objectives and relays capitalize on these core mechanics, building out ways to enjoy the game beyond the basic play experience. Race the Sun is compelling in a way that could make it a daily habit, with fresh challenges awaiting every sunrise for those who dare to take flight."
1918,Sniper Elite III,6.0,1,"           All of this is assuming you'll even be able to connect to an online game. Of the 30 or so times I tried to locate matches, I found my way into just three games. The other 27 times? I either failed to connect before the game even started, disconnected after a single spawn, or crashed to the PlayStation 4's dashboard. Sniper Elite III's multiplayer is unstable at best, with most of my playtime revealing a mostly broken experience. "
505,Pokemon Sword / Shield,8.0,2,"One of the best parts of Pokemon Sword and Shield was exploring the Wild Area, an expanse of rolling hills, sand dunes, and lakes that made collecting the games' 400 Pokemon especially enticing. The first DLC for the games, The Isle of Armor, improves upon the original Wild Area--in fact, the island is all Wild Area, with far more variety and much more interesting locales to explore. While it doesn't alter the game much, The Isle of Armor recaptures the joy of exploration and catching new Pokemon, and it makes me especially eager to see where the next DLC takes us.In my original Pokemon Sword and Shield review, I said that ""the Wild Area is the show-stopping feature of this generation. Pokemon roam the fields and lakes, changing with the day's weather. They pop up as you walk by, and you can even identify Pokemon out of your direct line of vision by their cries. It's all too easy to set out for one destination only to be distracted by a Pokemon you haven't caught yet, an item glittering on the ground in the distance, or even an evolved form of a Pokemon that you didn't realize you could catch in the wild. There's constantly something new to do or discover, and it's there to engage you right out of the gate.""The Isle of Armor doubles down on this. The island is bigger and better than the regular Wild Area, and its various biomes all feed into each other more naturally. Open fields transition to wetlands, which border a beach and a forest. Rivers flow out to the ocean, and following a river can sometimes lead you to a cave. Changing weather patterns make more sense than they do in the Galar region's main Wild Area, too, where weather shifts seemingly at random as you bike through similar-looking fields. Instead, because most areas on the Isle of Armor are separated by rivers or caves, the transition from rain to sunshine to fog isn't so abrupt. It's overall an even more satisfying place to explore.This DLC adds about 100 returning Pokemon not in the original Galar Pokedex, and they, too, make sense within the Isle of Armor's landscape. Bouffalant and Quagsire roam the wetlands; Amoonguss and Tangela lurk in the forest; and Sharpedo charge at you at high speeds while you ride your Rotom bike across the seas. You can even spot a giant Wailord out on the ocean from the mainland, in a rare example of the Pokemon being represented at its correct size in any of the video games. Encountering and catching the new additions is its own reward, of course, but it's also just a delight to see them in their ""natural"" habitats.Driving your exploration of the Isle of Armor is a light but cute story about a martial arts dojo and the adorable new Legendary Pokemon Kubfu, who becomes your training partner. The story has a quirky kung fu-movie energy, from the rather mean-spirited rival to the kooky master who teaches you wisdom through seemingly unrelated tasks to Kubfu overcoming his shyness in order to master his martial art. Kubfu is absolutely the star, and I didn't really want to evolve mine, considering how spirited and teddy bear-like he is.I also got surprisingly invested in a side activity that has you searching for 151 Alolan Diglett across the island, which had the effect of getting me to scour the entire map for their three little hairs sticking out of the ground. It brought me to the areas that the story didn't, necessarily, and kept me busy as I searched for Pokemon and items. I was incredibly satisfied with myself when I found the final Diglett, and the rewards are great on top of that.On that note, items are another strong suit of The Isle of Armor. While Sword and Shield made a lot of key quality-of-life changes for the series, most of which take out annoying grinding and make high-level competitive play far more accessible, there were a few gaps--some important items were still ridiculously hard to get. Those items are now more plentiful on the Isle of Armor, including the elusive Flame Orb, which was the bane of my existence for several months. These kinds of tweaks are small, but they do improve the experience overall.The Isle of Armor is open to you almost from the very beginning of the main game, and while that's great, it doesn't add much in the way of endgame content for returning players. There is a battle arena that challenges you to defeat a series of trainers using only one Pokemon that have a particular type, like water or fire--and it's cool to see a Pokemon game give a platform to a very popular battle format among fan groups (where it's called ""monotype""). I actually already had a fully trained electric team in Shield, and I still found these battles pretty challenging, which was a nice surprise that made me want to try out other monotype teams.DLC is new to the main-series Pokemon games, and it's certainly a great alternative to replaying the same game a year or two later when the souped-up rerelease comes out. But like the traditional third or ""Ultra"" version, The Isle of Armor does refine much of the experience we had in vanilla Sword and Shield, with a more interesting Wild Area to explore and some small quality-of-life tweaks that further the progress Gen 8 has made in that regard. It doesn't totally change up the game, to be sure, but The Isle of Armor is definitely a delight."
2165,Forza Motorsport 3,9.0,2,"  Do you like cars? If so, Forza Motorsport 3 is the game for you. In fact, provided you don't hate cars, Forza Motorsport 3 is the game for you. Turn 10 Studios' latest racer is an ambitious game that tries to be a lot of different things for a lot of different people, and the great news is that it succeeds at just about every turn. It doesn't matter how good you are behind the wheel; you can find a difficulty level and a handling model to suit you. And while there are plenty of options available for those of you who enjoy painting or tuning your rides as much as you enjoy driving them, you don't have to devote any time to those features to reap their rewards. Forza Motorsport 3 is a bigger and better game than its predecessor in every way imaginable, and while it's not flawless, it's certainly way ahead of the competition.       Your first race in Forza 3 is spent at the wheel of an Audi R8 loaner, and by default, there are several driving assists--including the series' familiar dynamic racing line--turned on that serve as your water wings as you're thrown in at the deep end. From there, you're free to take your career in whichever direction you choose, though with limited funds at your disposal your first car is more likely to be a Scion than a Shelby. Career mode is divided into seasons, and each season you compete in a world championship that spans several races. You don't get to choose which championships you're entered into, so you start with relatively slow showroom cars early on and must get some miles under your belt before competing in thoroughbred racecars later on. With that said, championship races are generally two or three weeks apart, and so after every race you're invited to choose another, shorter series of events to take part in. You can also ignore the calendar completely if you choose, and just compete in whichever events you want to at anytime. Either way, the options you're presented with are determined, at least in part, by the cars that you own, so if you manage to get your hands on an Enzo Ferrari or a Porsche Carrera GT early on, you don't have to wait around before putting them to work. You might even find that you can use one or two of your cars in events for which they far exceed the maximum performance restrictions, though this bug doesn't rear its competition-trivializing head very often.      Regardless of what you're driving, you're free to pick and choose which assists you want to use, and you have an opportunity to quickly alter your settings before every race. This is definitely a welcome feature, because while you might not feel the need for antilock brakes or stability control when you're driving something modest, you might not be nearly as confident climbing into a Bugatti Veyron supercar for the first time. It's tempting to make things easier by keeping all of the assists turned on, but there's a great incentive to turn them off, because every time you do so, your potential earnings increase. For example, turning off the autobrake (which you'll probably want to do right away) increases your winnings by 10 percent, and if you opt for ""simulation"" damage, fuel, and tire wear as opposed to ""cosmetic"" or ""limited,"" you can add another 15 percent on top of that. This setup ensures that while anyone who picks up Forza 3 can spend their entire career feeling like a winner, better drivers will earn more money in the process, and rightly so. Similarly, you get to keep more of your winnings if you don't have to spend them paying for damage incurred during a race, so although it's possible to win some races by driving aggressively and using opponents or walls to slow you down for corners, you won't be doing yourself (or your opposition) any favors in the long run.       That's especially true if your opponents are other online players or a friend that you're playing split-screen with, because retaliation is likely to cross their minds at some point. Forza 3's AI is more focused on the finish line than on forcing you off the track, which makes it superior to some of the players you're likely to meet online, but it's not an intelligence that's going to pose a threat to its human counterparts anytime soon. At times, AI drivers are superb: they jostle for position, they look for openings when other drivers falter, and they know when to back off if their attempt at an overtake starts looking perilous. Occasionally, though, these otherwise believable opponents will make such silly mistakes that you'll swear they must have fallen asleep at the wheel. At Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya, for example, it's not nearly as uncommon as it should be to see opponents accelerate toward the Seat hairpin and fly off into the gravel without ever appearing to touch the brake pedal or the steering wheel, and it's not unheard of to see different opponents making the exact same error on consecutive laps. Race incidents like these aren't something you'll see often, especially if you're spending most of your time at the front of the pack, but if you're in a closely contested race, it's less satisfying to win as a result of an opponent's incompetence than it is to beat him out of a corner or slingshot past him on a straight.     It's also slightly less satisfying to cross the finish line first if you've felt the need to use Forza 3's new rewind feature during the race, but it's a great (if unoriginal) addition to the game regardless. If you consider yourself a purist, you might feel inclined to look down on this new feature and on anyone who uses it, and that's fine, because you don't have to use it if you don't want to, and nobody is ever going to have the option of using it while competing with you online. Furthermore, if you're from the no-rewind school of racing, your leaderboard times will always appear above those of drivers who have used the rewind to correct any number of their mistakes. The leaderboards also clearly display which assists drivers were using when they recorded their posted lap times, which might ultimately end up being a better incentive for you to turn them off than extra winnings are.       As in Forza 2, your winnings in Forza 3 can be used to buy new cars (more than 400 different models are available at launch), either direct from manufacturers or from other players via an auction house. However, it seems unlikely that Forza 3's auction house will be the hive of activity that Forza 2's was, not because it has changed for the worse, but because unless you're looking for a bargain or want to offload a car that you've been awarded, there are few reasons to go there. In Forza 2, one of the main reasons to buy a car from the auction house was that it had a great custom paint job and/or because it had already had money spent on upgrading and tuning it. You can still buy and sell cars this way if you choose to, but in Forza 3 you can also deal in tuning setups, paint jobs, and individual vinyl designs without having to attach them to cars. For example, if you re-create a favorite video game character on the hood of a car and you want to earn some credits selling it, you now have two options. You can either sell it as a vinyl that other players will be free to paste onto any car that they choose (safe in the knowledge that they won't be permitted to resell it subsequently) or incorporate it into a design for a specific model of car so that players who own one of those cars can apply it to their vehicle. It's a vastly superior system to that in the last game, and because potential buyers can search for designs either by typing in keywords or by using presets like ""retro,"" ""anime,"" and ""realistic,"" there's a good chance that players who are interested in the kinds of things you create will find their way to your in-game storefront.      Forza 3's car models look fantastic in their showroom and real-world race liveries, but it's the designs being created by the community that are really making them pop. That's no mean feat, because the tools that designers have to work with, while clearly powerful, don't make life easy. If you're familiar with the design tools in Forza 2, then you might be disappointed or at least surprised to learn that they haven't changed much in Forza 3. You still work primarily with geometric shapes and generic-looking icons, you still group large numbers of them together to create race team logos or photo-realistic images of your favorite Brazilian supermodels, and it still takes a lot of work to create something worthwhile. It's time well spent, though, and because there's now an option to create designs on a perfectly flat surface before applying them to a car, you no longer have to use the roof of a Mini Cooper for a canvas. Would this aspect of the game be better if you could import images from Photoshop or just scan them in? Absolutely not. Sure, it would be easier, but it wouldn't be as rewarding, and more importantly it wouldn't be fair for players without access to the necessary hardware or software. It's also unlikely that the end results would look significantly better. Spend some time checking out the top designs, as rated by other players, and you'll realize that just about anything is possible with Forza 3's design tools; you just have to get good with them.       If you're more inclined to spend your time racing than playing with geometric shapes, there's still no reason you can't have great-looking cars. Just make sure you win enough credits to buy all of the designs you want. Whether you're racing in your single-player career or online with up to seven opponents, all of your winnings go into the same pot, and so do your experience points. Leveling up in Forza 3 doesn't benefit you in the way that you might expect it to in other genres, but every time you reach a new level, you're awarded a new car, so it can be a strong incentive to keep playing long after you've told yourself ""just one more race."" This is especially true later in your career, because the cars you're given are among the most desirable in the game--assuming you haven't rushed out and bought them already.     Just as you would in real life, it's not a bad idea to test-drive cars before you buy them. None of the cars in Forza 3 handle poorly, and all are delivered to your garage with perfect bodywork and spotlessly clean, accurately re-created interiors. Inevitably, there will be cars that suit your driving style better than others, though, and if you don't know much about tuning, it can be tough to tame a car that's proving problematic for you--even if you take advantage of the new quick upgrade option that optimizes your car for the class of competition that you want to use it in. In Career mode you're only able to use cars that you own, but every car in the game (as well as those in your garage) is available to you from the outset for use in single races, hot lap events, and multiplayer.        Online play was one of Forza 2's greatest strengths, and the same is true of Forza 3. It doesn't matter if you're looking to enjoy a private session with friends or hop into a race with random opponents--getting your car onto the starting grid couldn't be easier, and it's hard to imagine how the subsequent races could be any better. Even in multiplayer, detailed environments from all over the world fly by at speeds in excess of 200 miles per hour without ever posing a threat to the frame rate, and the game is very smart about knowing when to ""ghost"" players who have tried to take shortcuts or are in the mischievous minority who think it's hilarious to drive the wrong way and try to crash into other racers. In addition to regular races, online options include Drag and Drift events, as well as three different Tag variants, Elimination races, and team-based Cat and Mouse competitions. As the host of a session, the options that you have to customize these game types number in the dozens, and you can even force players to turn off certain assists or use a specific camera angle.     Those camera options include all of the usual suspects: bumper, hood, cockpit, chase near, and chase far. Another great feature of Forza 3, which will be familiar if you played the previous game, is that at any point during a single-player race or during a replay of a multiplayer race, you can pause the action to take a photograph. The in-game camera has more settings for you to tinker with than the cameras that most of us use in real life, and if you're good at photography (or even if you're not) it's possible to create some impressive images. This is especially true at new tracks like Italy's Amalfi Coast, Japan's Fujimo Kaido, and the United States' Sedona Raceway, which are great additions to the sizeable roster not only because they offer very different and enjoyable driving experiences, but also because they're set in some quite beautiful locations. If you choose to share photos by uploading them to your storefront they'll also appear on the official Forza Website, from which you can download them for posting in forums and the like.        Other than some load screens that stick around long enough to outstay their welcome before each race, the quality of Forza 3's presentation is uniformly excellent across every aspect of the game. The menus are clean and intuitive, the in-game visuals never fail to impress, and the default audio options prioritize the satisfying roars of the cars' respective engines over the 30-plus licensed tunes playing in the background. Artists on the soundtrack include The Hives, The Fratellis, Fall From Grace, Alkaline Trio, The Qemists, DJ Drunken Master, Logistics, and many more. Regardless of whether or not they're to your liking, there's no denying that the vast majority of the songs on the playlist make good driving tunes.     There's also no denying that Forza Motorsport 3 is a truly special racing game. Not only does it make simulation-style racing accessible to anyone with the inclination to give it a try, but it looks and sounds superb doing it and manages to foster an unusually strong sense of community along the way. If you have any interest whatsoever in racing games, even if you've never played one before, you'd do well to pay a visit to your local video game showroom and become a member of the Forza Motorsport 3 owners' club at your earliest convenience.  "
1068,Warriors All-Stars,7.0,2,"Series fans might initially raise an eyebrow at this, as the Warriors Orochi games have combined Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors characters for some time now, and more recently characters from Dead or Alive and Ninja Gaiden. But if Warriors All-Stars demonstrates anything, it's that Tecmo-Koei's back-catalogue is perhaps a little more varied than you thought.The game plays out in typical Musou fashion, with you taking control of a general and proceeding to slash your way through literally hundreds of hapless enemies in each battle, and occasionally going toe-to-toe with an enemy general with similar abilities to your own. Charging up gauges by dealing or receiving damage allows you to unleash powerful attacks, and there are some light strategic elements at play as each battle features constantly shifting objectives that force you to make decisions about where to position yourself, which enemy generals to target, which allies to support, which bases to take control of, and so on.This core loop of near-effortless wading through hordes of enemies with the occasional urgent objective or battle with another general, remains as compelling as ever. The series has a reputation as a mindless button-masher, not least because standard enemies seldom even attempt to attack you, but there's an alluring serenity to it at times, a satisfaction in neatly mopping up every last bit of red on the map before bringing the battle to a close. Moreover, while mastery of your chosen character's moveset doesn't initially seem a huge concern, it becomes essential as the difficulty ramps up and you're forced to juggle more and more time-sensitive objectives. Dealing with hordes of enemies is easy, but you really have to learn to do it as efficiently as possible.All-Stars mostly sticks to this formula, but it does have a few ideas of its own. As well as picking the character you'll play as for each battle, you can also pick up to four other characters to accompany you. For the most part they'll simply follow you around and help you defeat enemies as you go, but they also each have a specific supporting move that can be triggered at will. These range from status effects, such as putting enemies to sleep, to creating a vortex that sucks all enemies in its range into a small area, allowing you to more easily dispatch them with a single combo. In addition to this, each of these characters can be called up to stand side-by-side with your character and mimic their actions, essentially forming a ludicrous wall of death for a limited time.Chief among the new additions, though, is Musou Rush. You start each battle with the ability to perform one Rush, and once used you can recharge it by fulfilling certain objectives. When activated, some chirpy trumpets kick in and you become incredibly overpowered for a short period of time, as your chosen allies appear on-screen to cheer you on as if they're your biggest fans.The best part of all is that it doesn't even matter if there aren't hundreds of enemies around to begin with--once you activate a Rush, the game just starts spawning them in front of you as fast as you can take them down. It makes absolutely no sense, but as a concession to the joys of player empowerment and the general idiotic brilliance of the Musou games, it's a wonderful thing to behold.The diverse array of characters is an absolute joy ... Anyone with an interest in niche Japanese games will see at least one unlikely yet familiar character that’ll bring a smile to their faceThe diverse array of characters in the game is also an absolute joy. When viewing the initial set of available warriors, it's easy to scoff at some of the more leftfield choices the developers have made; Sophie from Atelier, Arnice from Nights of Azure, Laegrinna from Deception… but it's fair to say that anyone with an interest in niche Japanese games (and you're reading a review of a Musou game, so: hi!) will see at least one unlikely yet familiar character that'll bring a smile to their face, if only due to the sheer peculiarity of it. The inclusion of William Adams from this year's surprise hit Nioh is a fitting one; the inclusion of Opoona from the 2007 Wii RPG of the same name is less understandable, and all the more brilliant for it.Easily the best character in the game is Oda Nobunyaga, from the Samurai Cats series that never made it to the West. Modelled mostly on the famous Japanese warlord with almost the same name, Nobunyaga differs slightly in that he is a tiny cat equipped with a rifle and a magnificent baritone voice. His attack combos repeatedly summon groups of his tiny gun-toting cat-soldiers to blast anyone in the vicinity, and he might actually be the best character to ever appear in a Musou game.That said, players might be a little disappointed by the paucity of game modes on offer. While previous iterations have included story modes, free battles, multiplayer, and the superb Empires mode that sees players conquering their way across a map by strategically picking battles to take part in, All-Stars has a story mode, and nothing else.People hardly flock to Musou games for their labyrinthine narrative, and All-Stars certainly isn't bucking the trend here. Of course, a game that pulls together dozens of characters from different franchises was never going to be massively coherent, but suffice it to say it's the usual guff about a royal family performing a hero-summoning magic ritual so they can get some help defeating evil incarnate and heal the land. Still, skipping the cutscenes is easy enough, and if nothing else the knowing-ridiculous premise combined with the boldly-coloured menus and upbeat soundtrack give the game a strong Saturday-morning cartoon vibe.The aforementioned royal family has also helpfully split into three warring factions, each with their own storyline as well as unique playable characters and missions. So, even if you're not fussed about the story, there are plenty of excuses for multiple playthroughs and the option to take on non-essential missions throughout to strengthen your characters means there's certainly no shortage of things to do.The trouble is that All-Stars has the misfortune of being released as the Dynasty Warriors 9 hype train is gathering speed, and Tecmo-Koei have made it quite clear that they're on the cusp of bringing substantial changes to the admittedly formulaic series. While it might seem unfair to judge All-Stars against a game that doesn't even have a release date yet, it's hard to see it as something more than a stopgap to keep fans happy while the promised headline act is still in development.That doesn't stop Warriors All-Stars from being a lot of fun in its own right, though. Series newcomers might be better served by the likes of Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends or Hyrule Warriors--equally enjoyable games that can now be found at much lower prices--but All-Stars' twist on the standard Musou mechanics and the delightful whimsy of its whole premise certainly elevates it enough to make it an easy recommendation for veterans.And once again, to be clear: you can play as a talking warlord cat with a gun."
4592,J.J. &amp; Jeff,4.0,0,"  Nobody liked J.J. and Jeff when it was originally published for the TurboGrafx-16 roughly 17 years ago, so it's a bit of a surprise to see that Hudson has gone through the effort of making it available for the Wii's Virtual Console. The game's bathroom-inspired humor is occasionally amusing, but the slippery characters and sketchy collision detection render this Super Mario Bros. wannabe practically unplayable.        J.J. and Jeff are two geeky detectives who have set out to rescue a kidnapped businessman in a land full of wild dogs and snapping crabs. It doesn't matter which character you pick. Jeff wears sunglasses and J.J. doesn't, but they both run at the same speed and jump to the same height, and they both can perform the same high kick and low spray-paint attacks. Getting through all 24 levels contained within the game's six areas primarily involves jumping between platforms and bouncing atop enemies. At the end of each area, you won't encounter an angry dinosaur named Bowser. You will, however, have to kick the bejeezus out of a muscular goon who doffs a new wig every time you meet him. Touching enemies will take away some of your vitality meter, while falling into a pit or landing in fire will outright cost you one of your lives. Conversely, you regain vitality by collecting fruit items or by gambling coins in the slot machines that are frequently hidden in the roadside bathrooms you come across.     Toilet humor is the game's defining aspect. The level layouts aren't especially memorable, the squeaky sounds and repetitive beats are forgettable, and the large characters and colorful backgrounds are merely passable. In 1990, J.J. and Jeff etched itself into the minds of stubborn TurboGrafx owners with frequent references to excrement. Birds will often drop a pile your way as they fly overhead, and other animals will sometimes target you with their dung as they recoil from one of your attacks. About once per level, you'll encounter the character you didn't pick standing idly in the background or hurling soda cans at you from a garbage bin. However, on rare occasions, you'll notice that he's standing there with his back to you with his knees bent slightly, as if he is urinating.        Considering that the Mortal Kombat controversy and the ESRB rating system arose a couple of years after J.J. and Jeff was originally published, you might think it's insane that parents and politicians never made a stink over the game's scat jokes. Part of that is because the TurboGrafx didn't quite have the popularity of other consoles from the era. The other reason is that a good number of people who actually played J.J. and Jeff shut the system off out of frustration within a couple minutes and, as a consequence, didn't realize the extent of the game's toilet humor. Momentum causes the characters to keep sliding when you try to stop or change direction, which makes it almost impossible to survive the brutal jump sequences that are commonplace throughout the game. On top of that, the collision detection varies so much that you'll frequently fall through the edge of a platform or take damage from an enemy that you clearly weren't touching. Fighting with the controls and losing lives for no good reason sure takes the piss out of the game's bathroom humor.     J.J. and Jeff is probably the only console-based video game to incorporate dodging animal droppings as a gameplay feature. While that's neat from an antiestablishment perspective, the presence of poo doesn't make up for the game's sloppy programming.  "
4201,Digimon World Data Squad,4.0,0,"  Namco Bandai is at it again with Digimon World: Data Squad, a grinding role-playing game that's content to slap the Digimon name on some of the most tired Japanese RPG conventions and call it a day. But if you love Digimon and have a high tolerance for random encounters, as well as shallow turn-based combat, then boy howdy, you're in luck!        Digimon World: Data Squad exists predominately as a tie-in for the recent Digimon: Data Squad anime series, so it shouldn't be too surprising that the game spends little time on character introductions and cuts straight to the flimsy plot. There's a great evil in the digital world that's causing Digimon to act all crazy,  threatening to break through to the real world, and it's up to the spiky-haired, androgynous Data Squad to investigate. Making things personal, the younger sister of one of the members of the Data Squad, along with a bunch of other young girls, has gone missing, and they believe there's a connection. Characters will occasionally pop up to shout some awkward dialogue, but once all the pieces are set, the rest of the game is mostly just a long, tedious dungeon crawl.     You'll start off playing as Data Squad member Marcus Damon, whose Digimon is the dinosaur-like Agumon. But before long, you'll be playing as the entire Data Squad, providing you with a small party of Digimon with which to fight. With your party in tow, you'll be sent to various locations to wander around aimlessly and get into random encounters with the same handful of enemies every few steps until you somehow find your way to the end, where you'll usually find a bigger boss Digimon to fight. After that, you'll head back to base to load up on items and head off to your next destination.     The game touts an emotion-based combat system, where your Digimon will be more effective if you choose actions that it likes. The game makes the Digimon's preferences clear when selecting an action by showing duplicate entries for a specific action. The more entries you see, the more your Digimon wants to perform that action. It seems like more often than not, the action that the Digimon wants to perform is the action you should perform, which alleviates what little thought the combat would've required otherwise. This way, you just hit the X button a couple of times when sending your Digimon into battle, allowing you to focus on more important things, such as staring idly into space.         Your Digimon will evolve over time, and there's a pretty huge number of different evolutionary paths each Digimon can take. You can influence this process by fulfilling specific conditions, which can include reaching certain experience levels and having an encounter with a specific enemy. The strengths and weaknesses of your party can change dramatically through evolution, which would have been totally interesting, if the game didn't basically play itself.     Perhaps worst of all is the fact that all of this plays out at a snail's pace. The environments are needlessly serpentine, and without a map to refer to, it's nearly impossible to tell one bland screen from the next. The frequency of the random encounters doesn't help, and once you're actually in combat, it seems like a single attack takes forever to play out. This is not because there's so much going on, but because the game pads the encounters out with needless pauses and constant camera angle changes. When you've got three Digimon on each side, it can take several minutes just to make your way through a single round of combat. On top of all that, Digimon World: Data Squad isn't much of a game to look at, with cheap, repetitive environments, enemies, and attack animations.     Digimon World: Data Squad is far less concerned with being a good game than it is with acting as a brand delivery mechanism for hungry Digimon fans. To an extent, the fact that it's a lousy game probably won't matter too much to the target audience. But if your criteria for a good game goes beyond ""must contain Digimon,"" keep looking.  "
2884,Dance Central 2,8.0,2,"    too perfect--the blond locks and incessant grin of surfer Bodie being the most grating--they fit within the flashy style of the game. You earn the respect of a crew by performing a dance with it. If you earn enough stars, you can take on a locked track, which unlocks other crews for you to dance with, as well as new outfits. Crew Challenge is a lot of fun, and the silly--if shallow--storyline about taking down a mysterious megalomaniac dancer encourages you to keep grooving.   Dance Central, but actually receiving a score for doing so makes getting them involved a lot more compelling. A second player can jump into a song at any time, with the Kinect automatically recognizing him or her and letting you compete for the high score. If you want to get even more competitive, you can challenge a friend to a dance battle, where you perform in solo ""spotlight"" sections and in a Free-4-All minigame. During Free-4-All, various moves appear onscreen, which you and the opposing player try to perform. The first to do so correctly wins bonus points, as well as the satisfaction of outdancing your opponent.     Just Dance 3 so much fun. A staggered difficulty level ensures you can have a good time regardless of your ability level, though. Progressing from easy to medium and then to hard is immensely satisfying because it gives you a real feeling of achievement as you see your skills develop. If you're failing a particular routine, the Break It Down tutorial automatically marks certain moves that you're struggling with, letting you practice them with a virtual tutor. You're asked to perform each move until you can do it correctly three times in a row, and if you're really struggling, you can slow down the music to half speed to make things even easier, which is a useful feature.      A strong tracklist ensures you've got some great music to accompany your dancing, with more than 40 tracks on offer. While mostly club and dance based, the tracks provide quite a range. They include older songs, such as Sir Mixalot's ""Baby Got Back"" and Digital Underground's ""The Humpty Dance,"" as well as more modern songs, such Lady Gaga's ""Bad Romance"" and Rihanna's ""Rude Boy."" If you tire of the included selection, you can download more tracks from Xbox Live for 240 Microsoft points. Songs that you downloaded for the previous game are also automatically added to the tracklist, but if you want to import songs from the Dance Central disc, you have to fork over 400 Microsoft points.      Aside from downloads and leaderboards, there's not much else in Dance Central 2 when it comes to online features. The conspicuous lack of online multiplayer is a missed opportunity for Kinect camera-based global dance battles. You can upload pictures taken by the Kinect during your performance to social networking sites Facebook and Twitter if you're desperate for worldwide embarrassment, though. You might even look a little slimmer in them as well, thanks to Dance Central 2's fitness playlists. They range from quick 10-minute workouts to 50-minute epics and span several different tracks. Your progress is kept track of throughout, letting you know how many calories you've burned during the session and your lifetime total. Though it's questionable how accurate those calorie readings are, dancing is a form of aerobic exercise, and you certainly do work up a sweat.       The beauty of Dance Central 2 is its multifaceted approach. It excels at being a game that's great fun at a party, while also being compelling enough to play on your own. And it can help with your exercise routine, not to mention teach you a thing or two dancing. The superb choreography combined with the Kinect's full-motion body tracking means there's a real challenge in perfecting your movements, making it hugely satisfying when you achieve a five-star routine. The staggered difficulty level and excellent tutorials make it so that even newcomers can have a great time, and with practice, they may be able to pull off some impressive-looking moves. Smooth animation and a glossy presentation also help draw you in; thus, it's only your own inhibitions that can stop you from having a good time. Put any scepticism you might have about the ""casual"" nature of dance games aside: Dance Central 2 is an immensely entertaining game that is simultaneously accessible and challenging and is sure to delight anyone with an urge to hit the dancefloor.

1715,Sleeping Dogs,8.0,2,"Grand Theft Auto V and Chicago in Watch Dogs, the dense depiction of Sleeping Dogs' Hong Kong lends itself well to all-business efficiency, where it doesn't take long to get anything done, whether it's a story mission or a stress-relieving brawl that you pursue. As one of the better open world games of the last two years, this rerelease is not unexpected. Yet, as the second of Square Enix's ""Definitive Editions,"" this enhanced version of Sleeping Dogs does not exhibit the same level of care as this year's Tomb Raider re-release. Sleeping Dogs work because the game mixes passive diversions with dynamic ones, and just because activities are close to each other doesn't mean that Hong Kong is a city bereft of challenges. Even if you're just yards away from a hidden collectable, it might take you 10 minutes to find the one route to reach that treasure. Thanks to the city's tight design, it's not unheard of to reach 100 percent completion--and 100 percent satisfaction--in less than 25 hours. With all the post-release content added to the Definitive Edition, you're looking at an additional five hours. The two downloadable side stories--one involving Chinese horror myths, the other recasting protagonist Wei Shen as a traffic cop--excel by being lighthearted in tone, a fitting contrast to the tension-heavy story of the main game. For as much as Sleeping Dogs excels in its conciseness, much of the narrative pacing feels rushed. The ""rise through the ranks"" story conceits in urban open world games have run their course, and Sleeping Dogs would have been a great example of the latter had it not been for the hurried nature of Wei Shen’s promotions as a member of the Hong Kong Triad. Where the filler-free narrative approach works is by not centering the game on Wei's quest for vengeance. His motivations are never hamfisted: you don't need to lose a sister to gangs and drugs to sympathize with Wei’s emotional baggage. This material is ripe for a prequel, but Sleeping Dogs aptly focuses your attention on the present, immersing you in Hong Kong’s underworld through Wei's perspective. The story is a clear homage to decades of crime films featuring undercover protagonists, and explores the common theme of losing oneself to the well-curated undercover persona. You begin to believe Wei's loyalty to his fellow gangsters and his genuine rage when his ""brothers"" have been wronged. Yet as convincing as he is, the story never portrays Wei as being truly conflicted, or in danger of losing himself, although a few cutscenes try to convince you otherwise. Streets of Rage and Final Fight. We got it from the Batman: Arkham series, Yakuza, and to some extent, Assassin's Creed. Sleeping Dogs belongs in this camp as well, and strikes a happy balance between the fundamental differences of combat between Batman and Yakuza. In other words, Sleeping Dogs succeeds for having an absorbing counter-intensive battle system while still offering incentives to go on the offense whenever you so choose. Wei Shen's superhuman ability to fight like he has eyes in the back of his head elevates the game to the level of a martial arts movie. Sleeping Dogs' responsive controls make it easy to depend on counterattacks, thus making the the game's melee combat a perfect example of how great defense can be the best offense. You do not want to forget about the Yakuza-inspired, context-sensitive finishing moves, however, which act as impactful rewards for the more assertive player. Whether you want to electrocute a thug on a neon sign or grind a gangster's face in an outdoor generator, most every combat environment has objects to violently interact with. Contextual possibilities, combined with Wei Shen's Hong Kong cinema-level martial arts, complement--rather than conflict with--the more realistic elements of Sleeping Dogs. Both the story and United Front Games' interpretation of Hong Kong are cultural canvases to showcase and even educate players who know little to nothing about specific aspects about Chinese culture. Sleeping Dogs is abundant in expository scenes of classic Asian themes of brotherhood, the importance of family, and one's reputation. These moments are highly informative without being too heavy handed. It's wholly amusing to engage in a mission in which you disrupt someone's harmonious feng shui décor, and fun to hear a merchant speak ill of mainlanders. If you live with a significant other who is fluent in Chinese, you won't even need to call them over to pique their curiosity for Sleeping Dogs; the game's Cantonese dialogue will do that for you. If Square Enix is looking to turn ""Definitive Edition"" into a brand, it's doing so with varying results. The visual improvements to the two year old version of Sleeping Dogs are not as discernable as they were in the convincingly overhauled Tomb Raider, a game that had a much shorter release gap between its original and Definitive versions. The improvements in lighting and textures in Sleeping Dogs are only noticeable through side-by-side comparisons, which is disappointing. Conversely, Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition serves as a testament to the quality and high standards originally set by the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions from 2012. And let's not forget the PC version, which boasted an exquisitely high frame rate, whereas the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions are locked at 30 frames per second. Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, Sleeping Dogs commands an equally important role. Click here for more information about GameSpot reviews."
1936,Enemy Front,5.0,1,"Enemy Front's loading screens depict fictionalized, up-close, and chaotic moments from various battles of World War II. As the camera slowly flies around these scenes frozen in time, you soak in the mayhem: a swarm of Nazis in aggressive poses, gunfire and muzzle flashes filling the screen, and emotional civilians running for cover. You're given the impression that Enemy Front's gameplay will let you experience these dynamic moments. Yet this is a glamorized, false impression, which is all the more unfortunate given that it has been a while since we've had a notable WWII first-person shooter (not counting Wolfenstein: The New Order). It's a bad sign when loading screens are the most eye-catching parts of a game. Inglourious Basterds.   Given that he's a reporter, it's puzzling and laughable that the delivery of Hawkins' radio-broadcasted motivational speeches during the Warsaw Uprising is painfully flat. This poor presentation is a missed opportunity that's meant to complement the story's nonlinear structure, which, by the way, could have benefited from further exposition and context for those unfamiliar with the uprising. Moreover, Hawkins' character development feels forced; he starts as an opportunistic, news-hungry reporter on the front lines and slowly realizes there are greater goals in this war than the next big scoop. When you have something as clear-cut as a tyrannical occupation, it's hard to believe Hawkins couldn't empathize with the resistance movement right from the start. Sniper: Ghost Warrior series, so much so that this game could have easily been rebranded as a Ghost Warrior spin-off. Despite the game's ""play as you like"" marketing, using the sniper is almost always the best approach. Wolfenstein. A few chapters later, you have the option to send a truck downhill toward an unsuspecting squad of Nazis. These unconventional sections are Enemy Front's most intriguing features, of which there are very few. Crysis 2 and Dishonored, yet its levels do not encourage the same degree of stimulating improvisation due to the lack of unpredictable enemy behavior. What made dying fun in Crysis 2 was that you got to try a different strategy with each retry, resulting in new enemy reactions each time. You are nearly deprived of that feeling in Enemy Front. Because of the game's poorly laid checkpoints, dying elicits a sense of frustration and boredom at the prospect of having to retread over half a mile's worth of leveled French villages. The thought of having to kill the same 20-plus Nazis a second or third time was so unappealing that I felt no guilt running past them after subsequent respawns. This says a lot since these aren't the smartest Nazis. Sure, they're consistently keen enough to spot you if you're out in the open too long, but once they're on alert, their movements are disappointingly predictable. If you don't want to leave any survivors, you can use the classic shooter exploit of funneling enemies toward you for easy pickings. As much as Enemy Front also wants to cater to the stealth enthusiast, sneaking in this game is typically a cumbersome ordeal. A stealth kill is often useless since the drawn-out brutality of stabbing a downed Nazi three times is five seconds too long and leaves you open to detection. It's not as the studio intended, but you're better off approaching guards from the side since melee kills are instant and you get to avoid the stealth kill prompt. The contrast between the two methods is baffling. The inclination to run past entire squads of Nazis is partially related to the game's lack of play-style incentives. Yes, many great shooters don't have progression rewards, but it doesn't feel like City Interactive tried to give you reasons to play one way over another. Even the Nazi Eagle collectibles scattered throughout Europe don't offer any tangible payoff, let alone any of the expository factoids that you usually get from these kinds of items. Enemy Front could still have been an appealing and straightforward Nazi whack-a-mole game if not for its hot mess of glitches and poor design choices. It greatly suffers from frequent split-second freezes, often during crucial moments, such as when you switch to your scope or perform a melee kill. When allies accidentally complete objectives for you (for example, killing key generals), these accomplishments do not count toward your progress. This locks you from advancing, forcing you to reload the last checkpoint. Since the multiplayer lacks the background bedlam of planes flying by or mortar shells hitting every couple of seconds, it's unsurprising that it plays more fluidly than the campaign. While the modest selection of maps are sufficiently large and multileveled, the uninspired deathmatch and conquest modes offer nothing that you can't find in other shooters. It also doesn't help that weapons always respawn in the exact same locations. The fun is gone once everyone knows to make a break for the rocket-launching panzerschreck. Enemy Front lands in that unfortunate middle area where its faults aren't bad enough to leave a painfully lasting negative impression, but its key moments are too generic to be memorable. At a party 10 years from now, I'll suddenly recall the V2 rocket sabotage mission or the Warsaw siege chapter, yet I will have forgotten what game these scenes were from. It will drive me mad for the rest of the night, since it's unlikely anyone will pop up and say, ""You're thinking about Enemy Front."" And even if someone did chime in with the correct answer, I might not be convinced it was that game. That's the impression Enemy Front makes."
3258,MicroBot,6.0,1,"   Innerspace angle, with capillary-lined corridors suffused with red, pink, and orange hues. Fleshy walls loom up into the foreground, and indistinct glands throb steadily in the background, giving you the sense that you are suspended in the middle of an internal abyss. Inorganic pipes intrude on the landscape, often pumping fluid that gently affects the movement of your ship or vigorously sweeps you along to a new area. The visual depth and liquid dynamics combine to create a feeling of floating that is amplified by the ethereal, atmospheric music. It's a pleasing effect, though it's a shame there are no audio options. The sound of your frequently firing guns and the hum of your engine can diminish the mood.     Your default ship is equipped with two rapid-fire guns for killing enemies and a paddle for locomotion; the right analog stick controls shooting, the left controls movement. The enemies you encounter come in many shapes and sizes, and when you encounter (and kill) a new type of foe, it's likely to drop a collectible piece of data. Gather enough of these from a given enemy, and you unlock a new piece of technology for your ship. Weapons like homing missiles and laser beams add to your destructive power, while defensive boosts like extra health and shields can help keep you alive longer. New motors help you move faster and maneuver more quickly, and auxiliary items like a harpoon, a bomb, and a time-slowing device provide some strategic wrinkles. You get the opportunity to change your loadout a few times in each level, and experimenting with different combinations is a lot of fun. Equipping a few lancets and some damage-dealing engines can turn your ship into a speedy wrecking ball, while loading up on explosive bullets and protective shields can make you into a tiny tank. There are plenty of possibilities, and every element can be upgraded twice to significantly improve its effectiveness.     Though taking different permutations out for a spin is enjoyable, it's likely you will stick with the one you find most effective for much of the game. There are many different viable loadouts, but MicroBot never requires that you use any particular items in any given section. In each level, you navigate through corridors and open spaces, blasting anything that has a nasty robotic look about it. Some baddies are content to fire at you from afar, while some make kamikaze charges straight for your ship. When different types of enemies appear in significant numbers, things can get dicey, and in these moments MicroBot approaches the frantically engaging challenge offered by the best dual-stick shooters. Though these sections can be invigorating, the energy they create is usually dissipated shortly after by a return to the more deliberate, exploratory pace that dominates the game. Exploring every nook and cranny of each level and hunting down collectibles certainly has its appeal, yet while the atmospheric presentation flourishes in these sections, the action withers.        MicroBot is a game caught between two contradictory poles. On the one end you have smoothly paced exploration and collectible hunting that lets you appreciate the game's enticing visual presentation. On the other, you have fast-paced shooting and quick maneuvering that makes for some frantic, challenging action. Unfortunately, these two opposing scenarios make poor partners, each diluting the other to create a fairly bland experience. You can play the 20-level campaign and four challenge modes either alone or with a friend, but the online connectivity is limited to challenge mode leaderboards. There is a reasonable amount of content here for the asking price of $9.99, and the game does have some appealing elements. It's a shame they never coalesce into something more.    "
279,Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars,8.0,2,"Yoko Taro is a weirdo. Don't just take my word for it--the man himself has said as much with game development presentations on making ""weird games for weird people""--and there's a certain level of subversion and existential terror that permeates everything he touches. This is certainly the case with Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars, a somewhat surprising game to make after the smash-hit success that was Nier: Automata. But this is Yoko Taro, and this choice is itself a subversion. Voice of Cards: The Isle Dragon Roars takes the writer-director's signature style and adapts it for a role-playing game that retains just enough classic role-playing elements to keep it approachable.Taro is listed as creative director in Voice of Cards' credits, and though he actually isn't listed as the game director--suggesting he may have taken a less hands-on approach to its creation--its narrative beats and visual style certainly have his influence all over them. You play as an aspiring adventurer joined by a ragtag group of would-be heroes hoping to slay a dangerous dragon, beat a stuck-up group of nobles looking to find the dragon first and get a substantial reward from the local queen. The text's font appears to be the same as in the Nier series, and longtime Taro collaborator Keiichi Okabe returned to compose its music, which is so Nier-y you'd think Voice of Cards was a surprise new entry in the series (it isn't, but I kept waiting for the reveal). The Nier music DLC you can buy is almost redundant, considering how similar it is to what's included in the standard version.As you may infer from the game's name, you'll be completing your tasks entirely through cards. Every element of Voice of Cards is represented with a separate card, from the terrain to the characters and even the menu. It can occasionally be a little counterintuitive to commit so completely to this system, but there's also a unique charm to it that would be lost in a more traditionally-structured RPG. As you move throughout the world, cards flip over, sometimes revealing dead-ends or initiating a battle, and your characters use--you guessed it--one of a few cards in a battle system that seems to have taken equal influence from Yu-Gi-Oh and Hearthstone. Certain enemies have weaknesses, which you'll need to remember, and some of your attacks can plague them with status effects like freezing, poison, or paralysis.Battles are infrequent enough that they don't wear out their welcome, and a ""jump"" mechanic lets you quickly move between areas you've already visited, which in turn cuts down on the random encounters you're forced to endure. In fact, it almost feels like you have too much help on your journey; aside from a few moments later in the game, Voice of Cards is remarkably easy, with very few enemies posing a real threat. The ""freeze"" status can be applied to nearly every enemy in the game, rendering them unable to attack for multiple turns at a time and without a limit on how often it can be reapplied. I hit a game over screen just once, and though a story-focused game like this rarely benefits from a high difficulty, having a little bit more of a challenge wouldn't have hurt.Every story thread feels like it's there for a reason, with anything dark or… unusual serving the story rather than being there to merely shock you.The card-based structure also plays into much of Voice of Cards' humor, of which there is a lot. It might be the funniest game Taro has ever had a hand in, despite the melancholy themes. Characters ""bowing"" by turning their cards at a 45-degree angle made me giggle quite a few times. Excellent translation for the dialogue and character names--one buff hero is literally called ""swole""--gives it a distinct feel from the generic ""heroes fight dragon"" tropes it's clearly trying to avoid. Even the game master, the literal ""voice of cards,"" gets in on the fun, at one point mispronouncing a difficult name and having to try again.The turn-based combat and simple aesthetic make Voice of Cards a great choice for handheld play on the Nintendo Switch, especially because it uses a save system that makes use of both manual and auto-save slots. The text is noticeably harder to read when playing on the handheld's screen, however, and without a major visual difference on the OLED version, I found myself mostly sticking to the docked mode.Having played both Nier games--Automata remains my favorite game ever--I expected some dark and, well, unexpected turns to come in Voice of Cards. They certainly did, especially with townspeople who appeared somewhat harmless at first glance, but I was also surprised by just how straightforward the game is. Taro's games don't rely on deus ex machina moments and he famously uses a ""backward"" writing technique to ensure any final ending is earned through preceding story beats, but it could have, and probably should have, been weirder. Still, it's a great first Taro game to play for newcomers, easing you into the mind of one of the industry's most talented and inspired creators. Every story thread feels like it's there for a reason, with anything dark or unusual serving the story rather than being there to merely shock you."
3172,Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory,6.0,1,"Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory was ported to the original DS  back in 2005 with little success. Splinter Cell 3D is another attempt at a handheld version of Chaos Theory, and though this reworking benefits from the 3DS's new controls and, to some extent, from its extra graphical oomph, it is an insubstantial offering: the original game's single-player campaign re-created in 3D, with a couple of forgettable minigames. Beyond the 3D visuals, there's no big innovation for the 3DS. You can control the optic cable used for peering under doors by tilting the console from side to side, but there are no multiplayer modes. (Even the critically panned 2005 DS port had co-op and versus modes.) The most adventurous it gets is to project mission objective text into the environment, as lifted from the recent Splinter Cell: Conviction, which looks smart, but that's all. There's nothing as exciting as that game's mark and execute feature, making this a disappointingly timid first sortie into the third dimension for the Splinter Cell series.          As in the 2005 game, you sneak through a series of levels as Third Echelon agent Sam Fisher, taking in such locations as Manhattan offices, a Panamanian bank, and bombed Korean streets, trying to keep World War III from erupting in the Far East. Splinter Cell regulars Colonel Irving and hacker Anna Grimsdottir radio in new objectives as you go, asking you to hack computers for information, take out bad guys, not kill civilians, and the like. Staying undetected means you have to stick to the shadows and keep quiet, with your visibility and noise levels monitored by separate gauges. The action takes place on the upper screen, with the touch screen below given over to the inventory. The circle pad moves Fisher around; the directional pad is used for jumping and crouching; and the camera view is positioned with the face buttons. The circle pad produces pleasingly fluid control, particularly in shifting Fisher from a slow creep into a brisk trot, though it can be a bit fiddly reaching for the directional pad to toggle crouch at the same time. In contrast to character movement with the circle pad, fluid camera movement with the face buttons is tricky, but not off-puttingly so.      With Splinter Cell 3D hitched to the 3DS's greater graphical horsepower, it's not so plagued by juddering frame rates as the original DS's Chaos Theory, but visually speaking, it's hardly slick. Other 3DS launch titles have higher frame rates, though rates here are at least steady with the 3D slider up or down. Models and environments are suitably detailed, but it's hard to be wowed by them in the dark, when you have to flip Fisher's high-contrast, black-and-white fusion vision goggles on to see. Darkness is fundamental to the game's stealth gameplay, of course, but even the well-lit areas are mostly gloomy, so much so that you'll be tempted to leave the night vision on to keep enemy silhouettes brightly highlighted.      The 3D adds pleasing depth to the third-person, over-the-shoulder view. The Conviction-style mission objective text that occasionally looms large in the environment also looks good. But the 3D is only really useful in two places: the large, translucent level maps, in which 3D helps distinguish one floor from another; and in the hacking minigame, in which you have to rotate a set of blocky, cube-based shapes and pick which one completes a larger cube with a missing section. The hacking is challenging, but lock-picking, the second minigame, is trivially easy--rotate the circle pad until you hear a clicking sound and then repeat. Though packed with detail on the relatively small screen of a handheld console, the 3D maps are invaluable in navigating the sometimes complex, though well thought-out, levels, which largely replicate the originals in Chaos Theory.         Fisher has a bunch of gadgets for evading enemies, as well as another bunch for ending confrontations, with or without lethal force. The former set includes a pistol attachment for disabling lights and security cameras, and your arsenal includes various adapters for Fisher's assault rifle, such as a shotgun and a sniper attachment. The latter also includes the Taser-like sticky shocker, knock-out aerofoil rounds, and a handful of grenade types. It's a nice selection of toys, but at the normal difficulty setting (there's also a hard and an expert setting), you can get by without much creativity, mostly trusting the pistol and the one-button, up-close melee takedowns. Except for toward the end of the game, these goons aren't too clever; they might not walk straight into a wall mine trap, but they don't try too hard to seek you out when they suspect you're nearby. Also, their accents are among the dodgiest ever committed to game audio, with Fisher's round-the-world tour providing a broad, international sample (the Japanese accents just about clinch it for worst in the game).      Splinter Cell 3D offers a reasonably long single-player campaign, with multiple secondary mission objectives for completionists to chase. The total absence of multiplayer, though, is a huge letdown. There's no online functionality at all--no leaderboards, let alone any kind of asynchronous, StreetPass-enabled trimmings. That's a disappointing show from a 3DS launch title, and though the controls are admirably tight and the visuals are adequate to fair, it leaves Splinter Cell 3D as a slight, low-value addition to the lineup.  "
3064,Child of Eden,8.0,2,"Rez, the aim is to eradicate an enemy virus from a computer system through five individually themed levels. Unlike Rez, though, Child of Eden has the option of motion controls via Kinect, resulting in a more engrossing, if slightly more cumbersome, experience than the standard control pad. However it's played though, Child of Eden is a game that offers an abundance of adrenaline rushes and emotional highs. And though you can reach the end credits quickly, the sumptuous visuals, ethereal sounds, and wealth of unlockable content ensure that you'll want to keep coming back for more.        Child of Eden has a story, and while it's vague and left to personal interpretation, it's effectively woven into the game without the intrusion of cutscenes. It takes place centuries into the future, when mankind has ventured deep into space, and the internet has become a vault for human knowledge known as Eden. Deep within this system are the memories of the first child born in space, called Lumi; the trouble is that she's under attack from a virus, so it's your job to fend off the invasion. If you successfully ""purify"" the parasites, you awaken more of Lumi's memories, and images of this young girl are used to great emotional effect as you come closer to waking her from her slumber.     Child of Eden is an on-rails shooter infused with some simple rhythm action elements. An onscreen cursor is used to attack enemies; blue for lock-on and pink for rapid-fire. The idea is to use the blue lock-on fire mode to highlight up to eight enemies at a time (known as an octa-lock) and then use the rapid-fire mode to shoot down enemy projectiles, as well as certain enemies (who are always coloured pink). Extra points are awarded for firing an octa-lock in time with the music, with ""good"" and ""perfect"" messages appearing onscreen to let you know when you're doing it correctly. Finally, euphoria (a screen-clearing bomb, essentially) can be used to clear the screen of enemies if things become too hectic.     While the mechanics remain the same whether you're using the Kinect or a standard controller, the experience is quite different. The default standard control scheme has you holding the A button to lock on, the X or right trigger button for rapid-fire, and the B button to activate euphoria. On the Kinect, you wave your right hand to lock on to enemies and then flick your hand forward to release the shot; you use your left hand for rapid-fire and put both hands in the air to activate euphoria. There's also an alternative control scheme where you clap your hands to change weapons. Either way, you're only required to move your hands rather than your entire body when using the Kinect.        Both control schemes work well, but the standard controller is easier to use. The Kinect tracking is good and the camera sensitivity can be adjusted in the menu system, but there are times when weapon changes will unintentionally move the camera and leave you feeling disorientated. But what the Kinect loses in ease, it makes up for by being the more immersive experience. Aside from allowing you the freedom to move in time to the music, it gives you the feeling of conducting an electronic orchestra as your movements directly affect the music and sound effects. With either control scheme, you can elect to put standard controllers in your pockets and have them vibrate in time to the music, which complements the rhythmic shooting.      Each of the five levels is based around a theme, such as passion or matrix, and each   motif has a striking and memorable visual/aural identity. Beauty, for example, sees you flying over lakes, shooting flowers and butterflies, and avoiding enemy projectiles that emit the sound of water droplets as you take them down. Every level ends with a boss battle, and these epic multistage encounters are undoubtedly the highlight of the game. Early on, you face off against a giant whale that turns into a phoenix, and later on, colliding planets transform into giant, running men. Later bosses change into forms which are only susceptible to one type of weapon.     If you're willing to submit to the sensory experience of Child of Eden, you'll find it euphoric, artistic, and downright spine tingling at times. You can finish the five main levels and see the credits in a little over an hour, but thankfully there's plenty of replay value in the form of new difficulty settings, alternative visual styles, and an unlockable challenge level. There's also content that requires repeated plays to unlock, such as concept art, music videos, and items that can be played with in Lumi's garden. Unlocking all of these items means completing the levels many times over, improving your purification rate, and performing specific tasks within each level, such as 50 perfect octa-locks.        Child of Eden throws an incredible amount onscreen and suffers only minor instances of slowdown. However, the more impressive achievement comes from its artistic design. Beautiful visuals, superb sound effects, and a sumptuous electronic score combine to make your senses tingle throughout the game. The soundtrack, by the band Genki Rockets (of which Miziguchi is a member) isn't as eclectic as the one in Rez, but it is just as memorable. There are no multiplayer options, but online leaderboards at least afford you a way to compete with friends.     Child of Eden is a bold artistic experiment that's also accessible and fun. It's easy to pick up and play, offers bursts of pure joy, and is even a pleasure to watch others play. It's over quickly, but the amount of unlockable content means it's something you can keep coming back to. Ultimately, if you value novelty and emotional engagement in your games, you'll find Child of Eden a memorable and rewarding experience.  "
4908,World War II Combat: Road to Berlin,2.0,0,"  Every once in a while we run into a game that is almost completely devoid of redeeming qualities. When that game happens to be in a crowded genre like a first-person shooter set in World War II, it casts an even darker pall on an already horrible product. World War II Combat: Road to Berlin is just such a game. Road to Berlin is an utter failure from top to bottom, offering ugly, drab graphics and terrible sound that match the low quality of the gameplay and game design.        There are 10 missions in Road to Berlin's very brief campaign. In each of the missions, you're given a primary weapon like a submachine gun or sniper rifle, a pistol, and an explosive weapon such as a grenade. You'll explore various locales in the European theater, such as a German air base, a submarine pen, and hardened bunkers, as you kill dozens of Wehrmacht on your way from point A to point B. It sounds like any other WWII shooter, right? Well, on the surface it does, but somehow the game designers couldn't even manage to get a game theme that has been cloned dozens of times to work well. First of all, there are absolutely no health packs that you can pick up--the only thing you can loot is extra ammunition for your weapons. This makes the game harder than it needs to be, as you need to be able to get from the start of a mission to the end without dying. The missions aren't particularly long, and you can absorb a decent number of shots. But any mistake you make means you have to start over at the last checkpoint, which promotes a trial-and-error approach to the missions where you try to memorize the locations of all the enemies.      And speaking of checkpoints, the save system in the game is flawed, as well. Each level is broken up by a few checkpoints that you can start from if you die. But if you happen to reach a late checkpoint with only a smidgen of health left, you may find it impossible to finish the level at that point. The game saves only your last checkpoint, and there's no manual saving, so that means you could find yourself forced to start the entire level over again if you accidentally trigger the last checkpoint with too little health. Further adding to the frustration is the inability to pick up or change weapons. You'll start some levels with a sniper rifle, which is so poorly implemented that it takes you out of zoomed view each time you fire, and it takes far too long to load in the next bullet. When you get into close-quarters situations on these levels, there's no way to pick up a different weapon, and so you're stuck with trying to shoot at close range with the sniper rifle or just using a pistol.      If the core gameplay were any good, some of those inherent design flaws might be forgivable, but this isn't the case. The mechanics of moving and shooting in Road to Berlin are downright terrible. The movement of your character just doesn't feel right, nor does the movement of enemies, who sometimes appear to be sliding across the ground like carnival shooting-gallery targets on rails. Level design is boring and uninspired, and whether you're outdoors or indoors, everything has a drab, gray and brown look. Plus, the guns don't handle very well. For example, the automatic weapons spray too wildly, and aiming down the iron sight of your weapon doesn't seem to improve your accuracy much, if at all. The worst part is that it's often hard to see anything. Enemies will begin shooting at you from the very limits of your visual range so that they're just specks in the distance. The threat reticle that was broken in the Xbox version of the game seems to be working properly in this version, but that's cold comfort for a game that would have been considered primitive even five or six years ago.        Road to Berlin looks and sounds about as awful as it plays. Environments and characters are laughably blocky-looking, and the level design is boxy and uninspired. You'll see vehicles like trucks, tanks, and half-tracks, but these don't even have articulated wheels or treads. Details like these are instead crudely drawn into the textures. The sound also does little to inspire. All the guns sound the same, like sharp firecrackers instead of real weapons. There's a bit of voice narration before each mission, done by a bored voice actor who phoned in the effort, and there's no real music to speak of. Road to Berlin includes online multiplayer action for 16 players, in modes ranging from deathmatch and last man standing, to capture the flag, king of the hill, and VIP. The server browser, if you can call it that, simply finds a server for you to play on, without giving you a full menu of servers to choose from. It's as though the developers lazily tried to emulate the Xbox Live style of quickmatching, as opposed to the PC style, where you can browse from a list of available servers. It doesn't make much difference, though, as any online game you find is liable to be full of bots, with maybe one or two other human players. The netcode is so awful that you'll find yourself teleporting back and forth, with hit detection that's frustratingly poor even at modest latencies. There's offline multiplayer action against computer-controlled bots, but just like the single-player aspect, multiplayer action in Road to Berlin is horribly dull. The bots don't exhibit much strategy, making beelines to the enemy flag in capture the flag or just running around randomly in deathmatch mode, and you can't play against the bots in king of the hill or VIP modes.     Calling World War II: Road to Berlin just another in a long line of uninspired World War II games would give it far too much credit. In a way, Road to Berlin isn't a WWII game at all, as you'll spend more of your time fighting with the poor game design than you will fighting against Germans. And, when you're done with that, you'll probably find yourself fighting the urge to snap the disc in two and throw it out the window. Avoid this game.  "
4442,Tarr Chronicles,4.0,0,"  English teachers should stay far away from Tarr Chronicles. Actually, let's go a little bit further and extend that caution to, well, everybody. Mangled English is probably the least of the problems afflicting this arcade-style space simulation from Russian developer Quazar Studio. Dull, repetitive missions make this one tough game to endure for very long, even when you're not puzzling over what the hell is going on due to the absolutely bizarre dialogue.     Despite Tarr Chronicles already being published in Europe earlier this year with the subtitle Sign of Ghosts, publisher Paradox Interactive put no effort into cleaning the game up for the English-speaking marketplace. This isn't the usual Russian game with garbled adjectives and no concept of how to properly use pronouns, though. On the contrary, the game's grammar is generally pretty good as far as these Russian translations go. Most of the words seem to be in the right place. But they often don't make any sense. So you get surreal descriptions like the one calling one race of creatures ""anisotropic"" and ""multiplied in Mirrors and antiquantums."" Um, yeah. Unintentionally funny phrases litter the text, too. Good luck keeping a straight face when you're assaulted by lines like ""The Executioner got us all out. Like puppies from a boiling cauldron."" Sorry, but, uh, yuck.        Not surprisingly, this makes the story in the solo campaign (there are no multiplayer options) impossible to follow. You're a human pilot stranded a long way from home in the far future, and the big enemy is some sort of ""anti-elemental"" force called the Mirk that is consuming all life in the galaxy, but beyond that the plot amounts to an alphabet soup of goofy sci-fi words like ""De'Khete,"" ""Sia'Nues,"" and ""Varkarru."" Events are hard to comprehend even when the bizarre terminology is skipped for stuff you can actually find in a dictionary. It's as if Quazar forgot to translate every second sentence, leaving you adrift in a sea of anecdotes and comments for which there is no point of reference. Pilots constantly drop names you've never heard of before and talk about unidentified ""he's"" and ""she's"" as if they were your best pals. It always seems like you're being dropped into the middle of conversations. Even the background information accessible in your cabin between missions is nonsensical. The encyclopedia refers to factions and events that remain otherwise unexplained, and your own personal log-book, presumably a journal of your experiences in the war against the Mirk, cites events that never happened and gives ""war is hell"" emotional heft to what seem to be lighthearted arcade furballs.     Given the head-swimming story, it's kind of a blessing that the actual gameplay is so simplistic. Tarr Chronicles is essentially a minor update on the old-school space combat sim where you pilot various fighter craft in linear battles against ever-increasing numbers of bad guys. There isn't anything new introduced here. It actually takes away at least one old amenity in joystick support, although the mouse-and-keyboard controls are smooth enough (if a bit sluggish during hard turns) that you'll never miss it. So if you pulled a Rip Van Winkle and went to sleep right after the release of Wing Commander in 1990, rest assured you could sit down and start playing this one without so much as a glance at the manual. If anything, the mission design is even more elementary than that in the nearly 20-year-old Origin classic. Virtually every assignment is a generic ""destroy all enemy ships"" jaunt, occasionally livened up with afterthought side objectives like escorting a capital ship, taking out weapon generators, or detonating mines.     Even when there is a specific purpose to your sorties, you still don't do anything more than zip around blasting enemy craft with energy beams and missiles. This all gets extremely mind-numbing in short order, due largely to the excessive number of opposition ships and the subpar artificial intelligence. While it's dreary enough to have to destroy a dozen or more enemy fighters in each and every mission, the bad guys make your task even more annoying by flying about in circles waiting for you to target them. It seems like the only way you can lose is when objectives are partially out of your control, as in the missions where you have to protect an allied capital ship from withering enemy fire and simply can't blast the baddies to bits fast enough. Thankfully, these moments aren't all that common, although they do occur often enough to make you curse the save system that stores your progress only at the end of what are typically multipart mission segments. Since the tougher objectives always occur at the tail end of these sections, failure typically means a lot of backtracking. Overall, there isn't a great deal of challenge on offer here, just endless repetition. The game tries your patience more than your flying skills and marksmanship.        Ship configuration is really the only interesting aspect of the game design. Different types of hardware are added to the hangar-bay loadout choices before every mission, giving you the option to trick out your ride with various reactors, guns, missiles, shields, hull armor, and the like. Choices aren't really explained very well, though. A talking-head clip of an engineer pops up to give you some highlights of one or two of the new goodies, but these brief descriptions never give you a full run-down on how such goodies help or hinder you in combat, or outline what you should equip for the task ahead. So it can be easiest to take the path of least resistance and just click the auto-configure button. Not that it's all that difficult to figure things out on your own. Stats for each modification are fairly bare-bones, and all you really need to do to custom-craft your ship is make sure that you keep the weight and energy requirements within operating parameters.     At least Tarr Chronicles looks pretty good. Although it lacks the cotton-candy nebulae that turn some space sims into galactic amusement parks, the backdrop is crammed with stars and superb lighting effects. Vessels are just a touch too dark. Many objects seem backlit by nearby suns, planets, and the bright starfield, which obscures a lot of fine details unless you get really up-close and personal. Audio is just as repetitive as the mission objectives, though. Wingmen repeat the same canned comments during furballs. You'll hear ""Group, hold it together!"" about once a minute. And the music seems to be a 30-second clip that loops incessantly and is so clumsily inserted into the game that there is often an audible tick when the loop restarts.     There are some things that man was not meant to know, and Tarr Chronicles is clearly one of them. But unlike so many other awful games, at least Quazar Studio doesn't hide this fact. On the contrary, it pretty much wallops you over the head with its incomprehensibility from the very moment you load it up. So, you might want to thank the developer for not wasting too much of your time, if not for anything else.    Editor's Note: This review addresses the digitally distributed version of the game. "
4469,Lightweight Ninja,4.0,0," Stardock's Drengin.net game division already released an excellent strategy game, The Corporate Machine, earlier this year--and both The Corporate Machine and Lightweight Ninja are part of the company's subscription package, which includes five games for $49.95. But as part of the package, Lightweight Ninja is just that: lightweight. The game, which is the first episode in a series, currently comes with just nine short levels, and although the company will release more levels for download on its Web site, they probably won't be worth the bother if the game's prepackaged levels are any indication. That's because Lightweight Ninja is a dated 2D side-scrolling platform-action PC game that doesn't let you do anything other than run, jump, pick up little items, occasionally shoot cute cartoon enemies, and run some more.   If you're familiar with the classic 8-bit and 16-bit side-scrolling action games on consoles such as the NES, the SNES, and the Sega Genesis, you'll probably feel instantly familiar with Lightweight Ninja's gameplay and controls. You play as Ty, a boy ninja who explores 2D areas by running and jumping through them. Ty must also avoid or shoot his enemies. These enemies include angry squirrels that toss apples at him, gangly robots that huff and puff their way across the screen, and kittens that are wrapped in thorns, for some reason--and Ty may stop these with weapons such as acorns, paper airplanes, and throwing knives. Along the way, he picks up gems (which are worth bonus points and extra lives), health items, and weapon ammunition--all with a speedy gait that resembles that of Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog character, except slower. But Sonic the Hedgehog made his debut about 10 years ago--and in a much more interesting game.   In fact, there's really nothing to Lightweight Ninja aside from running, jumping, picking up items, and occasionally shooting an enemy. Other than the small but noticeable float on Ty's jumps, the game's controls are fairly responsive--but you don't really need them to do much, anyway. You can run through a level, picking up gems for extra points and hunting down the midlevel checkpoints (a drooping sunflower that perks up as you pass it) if you want. But you don't really have to; all you really need to do is get from the beginning of the level to the end within each level's generous time limit. And aside from the fact that Lightweight Ninja's levels aren't really challenging at all, the game has a convenient save-anywhere feature that basically makes extra lives meaningless. If you die, you can simply reload your last saved game--but not that you'll really need to. The nine prepackaged levels that come with the game aren't particularly long or challenging, don't have any real secret areas to hunt for on your second or third time around a level, and don't even feature any tough boss enemies to fight.   Lightweight Ninja at least looks and sounds a bit better than it plays. The entire game--including the speedy Ty, each level he explores, and the between-level cutscenes--has a fairly well-animated cartoon look to it that is extremely plain but is at least colorful and consistent. Likewise, the game's music is extremely simplistic, and since there are only a few tracks included in the retail game, they repeat across the different levels--and you probably won't even notice. The game's sound effects are also largely forgettable.   Lightweight Ninja actually has some sort of story, though this story has little or no bearing on how the game itself plays. Ty is a highly trained superninja who's been treated with an experimental ""lightweight"" chemical that helps make him the deadly assassin he's apparently supposed to be. And he's been given a mission by his trainers to defeat an evil old man who's the head of a rival company. None of that really seems to explain why your short, sneering ninja character would throw an acorn at a thorn-covered kitten--or why the thorn-covered kitten would then let out a small ""meow"" and, in a puff of smoke, become a regular kitten.   If Lightweight Ninja sounds like a game for very young children, it's because it is. You can see this in the game's completely nonviolent content, its simple, unchallenging gameplay, its cartoon characters, and its main character--a ""cute"" ninja with ""attitude,"" reminiscent of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters that were so popular in the late '80s and '90s--but without the ninja turtles or the '80s and '90s. Lightweight Ninja's appearance isn't the only outdated thing about the game--even though the genre's never been popular on the PC, independent developers have been making better, more interesting 2D platform-action games for the PC for years. As such, if you happen to be a very, very young child, and your parents are trying to distract you with a nonviolent game for short periods of time, you might actually enjoy Lightweight Ninja. Otherwise, you'll probably find Lightweight Ninja's simple, unchallenging gameplay pointless and its initial nine episodes too short.    	  "
837,The Gardens Between,8.0,2,"It begins one dark and stormy night, when as if by magic the two friends are pulled into a strange world while hiding from the rain in their cozy treehouse. They materialize on a planet dominated by water, and the islands they sail between using their treehouse-turned-boat are manifestations of their memories, recreated with real-world objects. Supersized couches and knick-knacks function as structures and obstacles in the imaginary dimension, and sometimes as mechanisms used to solve puzzles. Your goal on each island is to reach the end of a path and deliver an orb of light--a process that solidifies the friends' memories as constellations in the night sky.Though you can influence each character's actions, you don't directly control their movement. Rather than move them to and fro, you can shift time forward and backwards, and the two characters will walk along a path in kind. They each possess a distinct ability--one can carry a lamp to transport orbs of light, and the other can activate switches that reconfigure puzzle-related elements in the environment.The environmental puzzles run the gamut from simple cause-and-effect scenarios to unorthodox headscratchers that require the use of dreamlogic. In practically every case the necessary hints are right before your eyes; shifting time to and fro and paying close attention to the way things change is often all you need to deduce a solution. The trick is usually the manipulation of objects that are free from time's grasp in conjunction with finding the right moment in time to let them loose.Without these puzzles The Gardens Between would struggle to last an hour, yet despite being modestly challenging and inventive, they somehow feel unimportant in the grand scheme. There is no context for their existence as obstacles other than being opportunities for two friends to cooperate, but the tiny doses of narrative at the end of each island reflect the objects in the scene rather than the efforts used to pass through it. Puzzles are the ""gameplay"" that allows you to play a part in the two characters' journey and in a way make the realization of each memory feel earned, but they fall by the wayside when the spotlight is focused on the two teens.Though the world they venture through is full of creative touches and small magical moments, the two characters own every moment. From the way they subtly peep at one another while crossing paths, to the adorable gestures they use to point out helpful objects in the distance, their body language clues you in to their special bond. They say so much without ever uttering a word. Their cute and quirky selves are infectiously adorable, and before you know it, you've tumbled head over heels into their world and ultimately the formation of a new, unforgettable memory by the end of their journey.It may only take two to three hours to see everything The Gardens Between has to offer, but the warm and fuzzy feelings from start to finish ensure that your memories of playing it will live on. The expressive faces of the two teens and the relatable memories they share will speak to anyone who's ever had a close childhood friend, and while the puzzles won't go down as the most ingenious or demanding, they nevertheless give you more time to spend frolicking in a nostalgic and heartwarming world where friendship is all that matters."
3005,Captain America: Super Soldier,6.0,1,"           The most devious of your secondary goals are challenges that provide difficult tests in your adventure. These time-based missions present you with specific duties, and you need to master your combat skills and movement abilities to pass with flying colors. These take an assortment of forms, including puzzle-solving, platforming, combat, and every combination thereof, which injects a healthy variety into your skull-bashing hijinks. However, certain scenarios fall flat because of mechanical limitations. Quickly defeating enemies is not The Captain's strength. Beating down enemies like you normally would (or countering their attacks) takes far too long, and even winging your shield and then finishing them off with a ground stomp doesn't always work. Cap focuses on the strongest enemy at any given time, so you may stand over a fallen foe and still not attack him. Challenges in which you aim for targets with your shield also have issues. Rotating the camera is inconsistent when pointing at the screen, and it's easy to accidentally lock on to the wrong target when you're trying to move quickly.       "
3786,Battle Lode Runner,5.0,1,"  Hudson originally published Battle Lode Runner for its PC-Engine console in Japan in 1993, but it never got around to publishing it for the TurboGrafx-16 (the PC-Engine's equivalent in North America) because the company instead decided to throw in the towel and concede the console market to Nintendo and Sega. Incredibly, after 14 years, the TurboGrafx-16 version of Battle Lode Runner has finally been made available in North America—not for the actual TG-16, but as one of the TG-16 games available for purchase in the Wii's Virtual Console shop. While that's a neat point of trivia and good news for anyone hoping to see other Japan exclusives make their way to the Virtual Console, the game itself isn't worth getting excited about. It's still the same ancient computer game that people had played to death by the time the 1980s came to a close, and the extra play modes and updated graphics do nothing to change that fact.        Battle Lode Runner retains the same basic gameplay from the original 1983 computer game. Each mine is a 2D level consisting of multiple floors connected by ladders. You use the directional pad to move your character back and forth on the different floors of the mine and to climb up and down ladders, while the two buttons let you dig away the ground that's immediately to your left or right. Occasionally, you'll unearth a power-up panel that will make you move faster, increase the number of holes you can dig, or give you a random curse. However, the main purpose of digging is to trap enemy monsters and opponents in the holes you create so that you can more easily grab the lodes of gold that are sitting around. The puzzle mode contains 100 different levels, in which the goal is to grab every piece of gold without running into any monsters. Some of the level layouts are challenging, but the act of climbing ladders and digging holes becomes rote and tedious almost from the beginning. You can create your own levels with the built-in puzzle editor, although the same caveats apply. The battle mode is slightly more enjoyable because it lets you compete with as many as four other people in survival-, escape-, and tag-style matches. Unfortunately, two people isn't a sufficient number to get a lively match going. You really need to have three or four people in the room with you to generate a good party vibe. And, even then, the action is so simple that you and your friends will probably lose interest within a half an hour.     The 16-bit graphics and audio in this version of Lode Runner are a huge improvement over the raster lines and beeps from the original computer versions, but they're still weak by 1993 standards. All of the characters and enemies are colorful blobs that vaguely resemble the characters from Hudson's Bomberman games, while the mines are put together with plain brick-and-ladder tiles. Digging and falling are accompanied by terse scraping and popping sounds. There's a lot of different music to hear, at least, and some of it is actually quite catchy. As you'd expect, the Wii has no trouble emulating the game. The standard Wii Remote works great, and you can sync up multiple remotes or plug in multiple GameCube controllers to get battle matches going. Also, the game doesn't look as blurry as some of the other TG-16 games on the Virtual Console, likely because its thick lines and solid colors stand out so well.     Unless you already have a passion for Lode Runner, you probably shouldn't bother spending 600 Wii points ($6) to play the TurboGrafx-16 version of Battle Lode Runner on your Wii. The battle mode is good for a few minutes of fun if you can get a bunch of people together, but the game is otherwise just too simplistic.  "
683,Observation,8.0,2,"The year is 2026, and you're on the station with Emma Fisher, a European crew member who awakens at the game's beginning to find that she has no contact with the rest of her crew on board. It's immediately clear that something catastrophic has happened; the station is no longer in Earth's orbit, and no-one is answering her attempts at communication. To say much more would be to spoil elements of a plot that are best left to surprise you--the first major twist happens within about 20 minutes. Suffice it to say that Observation's narrative unfurls slowly across the entire length of the game, with its mysteries growing all the more complicated and your sense of dread deepening as the game goes on.Observation absolutely nails its distinct lo-fi, sci-fi aesthetic. The cameras crackle and jump as you shift between them, and the stylistic film grain and distortion over every visual emphasizes your slight removal from the reality of the situation Emma is facing. Like many science fiction works of the last forty years, Observation is indebted to Ridley Scott's Alien--some of the tech aboard the space station feel like antiquated products of a decade long past. This aesthetic, paired with the game's too-near future setting, gives Observation the pleasant feeling of an uncovered classic or remake of an ambitious, older piece of work. SAM is far and away the most advanced piece of technology on the station, and even when you load up your own system menu (which lets you view the map, check system alerts, and perform other functions that unlock during the game) you're treated to some pleasantly analog and retro buzzing and whirring sound effects.You experience most of the game through the slow panning and zooming cameras, an effective tool at creating a creeping sense of tension, although the occasional cutscene is used to better capture action at a crucial moment. It's not about jump scares or personally being in danger; again, to say too much more would be to spoil the game's clever pacing, but it's a game that's incredibly effective at building dread more than overt terror.The actual gameplay is, for the most part, pretty simple. You need to explore the ship as much as you can from your various vantage points, scanning every document and inspecting every laptop you encounter, opening and shutting hatch doors, and interacting with the station's equipment. The bulk of the puzzles boil down to figuring out how to operate SAM's interface, finding schematics to help you operate certain programs, and learning the necessary procedures for the instructions you are given.The game does an excellent job of taking complex ideas and procedures and presenting them as simple operations. Everything from opening the airlock to securing the doors between sections of the station boils down to a few button presses; occasionally you'll have to take part in what is essentially a timed mini-game, but for the most part, you're just following basic instructions. The main challenge comes from figuring out how the different parts of the ship all work together, and reasoning through the impact of your actions and what information you do and don't currently have access to.At certain points, you'll need to control a spherical droid that can float around the station--and, more excitingly, outside the station--freely. It's a bit of a pain to control in tight spots, and it's easy to lose your bearings because the concepts of up and down are relative in zero-gravity environments. But there's a real thrill in breaking free from the static cameras and floating through the station, and in getting used to the sphere's limitations. Observation doles these sections out expertly, using the droid when it needs to make you feel more a part of what is happening. It plays on the droid's symbolic sense of place extremely well; it's the physical element of SAM that sells Emma's growing friendship with him.Often what you need to do next, and how to do it, will be spelled out extremely clearly, though the game's instructions could stand to be a tad clearer in a few sections. One time it seemed like I had hit a particularly abstract puzzle, but it turned out that I'd actually encountered a glitch where a certain event didn't trigger properly, which necessitated a quick checkpoint reset. This was a pain, as the game's checkpointing can be a bit strict--you keep any information you've collected through scanning objects, but it doesn't save after major actions, so it's hard to know exactly what you'll have to redo when you exit out. But it's not too big an issue, as I never lost more than a few minutes of progress.Slowly discovering every system on board, inspecting every room, and unlocking more menus and commands within SAM's UI is an absolute treat. Observation is a visual stunner, with only the odd lip-sync issue occasionally distracting from the level of polish and craft on display. Later events ramp up the inherent creepy isolation of a space station perfectly, too. The story is compelling and exciting right up until the credits roll, and the game doesn't let up on revelations, twists, or the increasing tension of knowing that the game is building towards something wild. Observation also achieves the extremely rare feat of containing audio logs that are both compelling and make sense within its world.Observation is a wonderful example of how to do focused, self-contained science-fiction storytelling in a game. It's well-written and clever, and nails the sci-fi tropes and aesthetics it both plays to and builds upon. It's a game that demands to be analyzed and thought about further once you're done with it, and while the internal world of the game is small, inhabiting it is a real pleasure."
2043,Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2,7.0,2,"     Lords of Shadow 2 eventually returns to what it does best: gothic action adventure. Throughout the story, Dracula finds himself back in time, though it's not immediately clear whether this is actual or imagined, but it brings the game back to its roots. Combat and fantastic environments take center stage, and with the game's new free-moving camera and an emphasis on exploration, both aspects feel fresh and new. Thanks to the flexible vantage, you're able to dash and leap during battle with greater accuracy than before. Throw in multiple new and diverse skill sets, and Dracula accurately feels like a powerful evolution of his former self, Lords of Shadow's Gabriel Belmont. This time around, there are a few new tools to play with, including a new weapon class that's capable of breaking down fortified enemy defenses, but the biggest changes (apart from the camera system) are the skill mastery system and the weapon-dependent move lists.       "
1357,Stellaris,7.0,2,"We'd coexisted with our neighbors peacefully for centuries, but we were out of space and desperate for some breathing room. Our scientists yearned to comb through the rest of the galaxy's hyperspace lanes and long-forgotten ruins. And our priests were compelled to spread the will of the divine. So the galaxy erupted in war.War always seemed to follow me in Stellaris. That's partly because it's hard to expand indefinitely without frustrating someone, but also because there's a few hitches hiding within the layers of Paradox Interactive's latest grand strategy game.If you've ever played Civilization or any of its 4X descendants, you'll be familiar with Stellaris' basics. You helm a new civilization at the start of its journey. You can choose how they'll govern, what their guiding principles are, and how they'll develop technologically. If you choose to play alone, each of your opponents will have a randomly generated set of traits all their own- ranging from despotic fantastical pacifists to xenophobic materialists. Human players are just as likely to come up with creative personality combinations too. When you start a match, you're dipping your toes into an ocean of possibilities, eager to yield as your people explore and grow.That principle is reflected in Stellaris' pacing. Before locking down your starting solar system and working to build out its infrastructure, you'll scour neighboring stars for potential colony sites and resources. Then move in with settlers and engineers to start exploiting virgin territory.Along the way, you'll find all manner of long-lost technology, pre-industrial civilizations and other space-faring races. Each often comes with a ""quest"" line of sorts that develops into its own narrative thread. On one of my first planets, I discovered an advanced subterranean people. I had to decide upon a diplomatic strategy for them, whether I wanted to give them access to technology, and if I'd be willing to bail them out if they ran into trouble.It was a small piece of Stellaris, but my relationship with these people became one of my most valued. In time, they paid me back for all the favors I'd done, and supported the empire at large. But even if they hadn't, I felt connected to them. I caught myself roleplaying my interactions with them, trying to live up to my empire's own benevolent spiritual collectivist beliefs. It's this kind of ongoing, deterministic narrative scaffolding that forms Stellaris' backbone. Where most other strategy titles are content to focus on conquest and victory, Stellaris wants its relationships and the story you weave as your people grow to be the focus.That runs straight to the core of Stellaris, too. As you encounter new species, you'll be able to integrate them as citizens in your civilization. And you'll have to balance their prejudices and ideologies against those of your own citizens, decide whether they can vote, and even help them settle new planets that might be tough or inhospitable for your own race. These dynamics can have massive effects on intergalactic politics as well. If you enslave or purge (read: genocide) another race, other civilizations will remember your sins and hold centuries-long grudges.These dynamics start coming into play when you hit the mid-game. After you've got your basic group established, as your borders and those of your neighbors start grinding against one another, you'll have to find more creative ways to keep up the early game's strong momentum. If you're not careful, you can be boxed in by ancient and powerful civilizations. Grand strategy games often devolve into war at some point, but conflict with these giants is a quick path to eradication. Instead, it helps to build a multi-racial empire with several disconnected settlements. When one front stalls, you can push another and keep your populace moving so that there's always something to do and someone to manage. It also helps to play on a map with few other empires so you can grow a quite a bit before you start running into problems.It's not easy, and it's a bit strange that you have to finagle the game into maintaining a solid pace, but those problems also stem from some of Stellaris' best decisions, even though they don't always work out the way they should. For example, research in Stellaris works quite a bit different than in most 4X games. There's no static tree you climb, moving from agriculture to calendars and then to crop rotation. Instead you'll receive several ""cards"" from a deck of possibilities. Some, like sapient artificial intelligence, are rarer than others and represent major leaps forward in tech that can also help you break away from the pack.Others are weighted to show up more often to give everyone the same basic tools to start with. In theory, this keeps any one game from feeling too similar to any other. That works to a point, but it also means that you can pass up some critical piece of infrastructure tech and you might not see it for a while, or if you're unlucky, never again. It forces some tough decisions that, while engaging, don't always make sense. There doesn't seem to be any real reason that I have to lose out on colony ships for a better research facility. On balance, though it's a welcome change, and I got more out of it than I lost.Technology plays into galactic diplomacy as well. Some hyper-advanced civilization may find your development pathetic and offer to bring you under their wing as a protectorate, giving you major bonuses to research and a benevolent overseer that can keep you safe from the big bullies on the block--or at least try. The catch here, is that if you develop past a certain point, you become your overlord's vassal. With that, they can, in time absorb your civilization completely. Or, you can request--and likely fight--for your independence, often at a time when their resources are spread thin with another war or even a recession.It's here--with warfare and diplomacy--where Stellaris takes the most risks, and their payoffs can vary from match to match. Those with pacifistic civilizations might try to form strong bonds with others and form powerful peacemaking coalitions. Others will, no doubt, flex their muscles and conquer all the can. Bringing everything from psychic warriors and specially designed war ships to bear down on their foes. And while these two outlets for Stellaris' systems each work well on their own, their dependent upon so many of the game's other novelties that they don't fit together all the time.Stellaris is strange in that it wants you to play on its terms, but within that you have amazing latitude.The semi-random nature of research means that you won't always be able to guide your people to what they need. Plus, negotiating federations can be difficult when meeting new races depends upon you breaking out of your starting area--something that can sometimes be impossible if you're surrounded by super-hostile enemies. When it works, though, an alliance can help you leap ahead and match your elder rivals. Trade with someone who pities you can provide a massive influx of cash to fuel your economy, and, within short order you might have a diverse enough population to colonize a dozen or more extra planets. That, in turn, gives you more people to crew ships, drive research, and more complex internal politics to manage. But that's just it, it's based on chance. You can tilt things in your favor and increase the likelihood of a more exciting game, but that's never a solid guarantee.Stellaris is strange in that it wants you to play on its terms, but within that you have amazing latitude. Its emphasis on exploration is exhilarating. It makes each run feel inviting and special. But that doesn't always hold. Some games run through to the end and hit all the right notes at all the right times. Others are best left running in the background as you crunch for better technology so you can break free of your narrow corner in the galaxy. This could be helped if you could sneak, or stealth ships through enemy territory to colonize far-flung worlds. Or, if you could have finer control of research. Or, if you could overwhelm enemy fleets with superior tactics, despite a massive technological disadvantage. Instead, you're at Stellaris' mercy. It is fortunate then, that more often than not Stellaris doesn't just work, it excels, but that makes its breaking points feel that much more agonizing because it wouldn't have taken much tweaking to smooth them out."
4295,True Crime: New York City,4.0,0,"  Shortly after Grand Theft Auto III set the gaming world ablaze in 2001, one of the first games to attempt to emulate that game's gritty style and open-ended gameplay was True Crime: Streets of L.A. The game left a lot of room for improvement, but it at least laid a foundation that could be built upon in future installments in the series. Somehow, though, with the follow-up, True Crime: New York City, the series has taken a huge step backward. True Crime: New York City is so riddled with problems that it feels like it was rushed to make it to store shelves in time for the holidays or was just a lost cause that got shoved to retailers in the hopes of recuperating some of the development costs. Even if you forgive the flimsy story, cliché characters, and derivative gameplay, it's impossible to look past the myriad of game-stopping bugs, frustrating glitches, and glaring technical problems that plague this game.        Before we get to the laundry list of problems with this game, here's the basic setup. You play as Marcus Reed, a young gangster-turned-cop who is out to clean up the streets of New York City with his own brand of off-the-books justice. Reed is the newest member of the Organized Crime Division in the NYPD, and he's eager to make a name for himself by taking down the biggest crime syndicates in the city. There are four major cases to solve, and each one involves taking down the same kind of stereotypical thugs and mob bosses you've seen in countless cop movies. Each case is broken down into several smaller missions that follow the same basic pattern. You get a tip about a bad guy, locate that bad guy, waste all his henchmen, and then interrogate him until he tells you about yet another bad guy that you have to bust. You then head off to do the same thing all over again in a slightly different location. The missions are extremely easy, and it doesn't take too long to complete each one. Since there are only four cases, you can easily beat the story part of the game in just a few hours.      If for some reason you feel like spending more time with this game, there are some side missions to keep you busy. You can meet up with informants who give you tips on various crimes going down around the city or who ask you to do a bit of dirty work for them. These missions are pretty quick and easy, but completing them is a good way to make a little extra cash. There's a madam who sends you on errands to take care of her girls, a cabbie who needs an extra driver from time to time, and more. Aside from the informant missions, you can join an illegal street racing circuit or put your fists to work in an underground fighting tournament. As you cruise around the city, police dispatch will inform you of random crimes that are happening in your vicinity. If you want to, you can go arrest or kill the perps. If that's too much work, you can simply walk up to people on the street and frisk them for contraband. Sometimes you'll find things like gun parts, stolen license plates, obscene photos, or drug paraphernalia. When you collar a criminal, you earn career points, and you can turn in collected evidence to the precinct or sell it to a pawn shop for cash.      Career points are rewarded every time you solve a crime. Once you have enough career points, you'll be promoted within the police department. There are five ranks to achieve, and at each rank you can earn a couple of new driving or shooting skills. If you play by the rules, you'll earn good-cop points. If you use unnecessary force and terrorize the public, you'll earn bad-cop points. These good-cop and bad-cop points don't have much effect on the game unless you reach the extreme on the bad-cop side of the scale, which will cost you a rank within the department.      The basic gameplay mechanics are pretty simple in True Crime: New York City. You can run around, climb on obstacles, shoot enemies, commandeer and drive cars, trucks, and motorcycles, and use a few different styles of melee combat. Each of the three console versions of the game play similarly, but the GameCube version definitely suffers from not having enough buttons. As a result, on the GameCube you have to push two buttons to perform various actions like opening doors and climbing fences, which isn't at all intuitive.        Once you play this game you'll realize why nobody in New York drives. It's just not worth the hassle. You can flash your badge or fire your gun into the air to get a driver to hand over a car, and you can also purchase various cars if you're so inclined. The cars are all based on real-world vehicles, and you'll recognize them as such even though none of them are licensed. The vehicle physics aren't realistic at all. Cars seem to float around at times, and they don't ever feel like they have any weight to them. You can perform some fancy moves, like driving on two wheels and performing a pit maneuver to spin out a fleeing suspect, but these tricks look and feel awkward. The pit maneuver is especially goofy, because all you have to do is lightly tap the rear quarter-panel of any car and it will instantly spin out, regardless of what type of vehicle it is.       The gunplay is extremely basic. You can lock on to an enemy and just pull the trigger until the enemy is dead, which usually takes only a couple of shots regardless of which gun you're using. You can perform a gun dive and aim manually for more precise shots, but those tricks are rarely useful. You can pick up any guns your enemies drop, and while there are quite a few different types of guns, they aren't varied enough to be interesting, and usually you'll end up picking up new guns just to get the ammo. Melee combat is a bit more fun, just because it looks and feels so ridiculous. You can punch and kick your enemies in a variety of styles--which you can learn at dojos located throughout the city--and you can also grapple and dive-tackle your enemies. When grappling enemies, you can slam their head against a wall, sock them in the kidneys, or, if you're stealthy enough, break their neck. You can grab anyone, whether it's a thug you're facing during a mission or some random person on the streets.        When you grab a random pedestrian, you can slam his or her head into a car until you wear yourself out, usually without much consequence. It's oddly entertaining to dent the hood of a cab with an old lady's head, only to have her curse you out and then walk off nonchalantly.     That's just one of the many completely illogical sights you'll see in this game. The developer did a good job of capturing the physical geography of the city, but the life within the city feels completely unnatural. There are only a few different character models for non-story characters, and you'll often see whole crowds of the same exact character walking down a street. You'll also notice that there are about 10 Crown Victoria-type cars to every one of any other type. It's also a bit strange to see the same character model used as a prostitute and also a delivery driver cruising around in a big box truck. The sound is way off too, and sometimes you'll hear a person on the street talk in two or three accents while spouting off random--and usually very profane--phrases.      Those types of odd glitches are everywhere in this game, along with some seriously crippling bugs. There are bugs that will make you randomly fall through the ground into a bunch of nothingness where you'll eventually die, bugs that make textures change when you get in and out of a car, bugs that cause you to inadvertently break a scripted sequence, thus making it impossible to complete a mission, and one huge bug in a later mission in the Xbox version of the game that makes it impossible to beat the game. Though considering how unpleasant everything else in the game is, maybe this version's relative brevity is a blessing in disguise. There are also collision-detection issues that require you to try several times to grapple a person, and edge-detection problems that cause you to get stuck on the edge of a platform and just tweak out for a while. That's not all--the game will actually freeze up entirely from time to time, which can be especially aggravating if you don't save your game often.      The graphics look about the same in each of the three console versions of the game. That is, they all look real bad. It isn't a matter of dull textures or blocky character models (which this game has plenty of); it's a matter of a frame rate that constantly hitches and snags. When we say constantly, we mean that the game will seize up for a fraction of a second every three or four seconds, especially while driving. If you're driving and you're about to hit something, the game will stop for a moment just before impact. To draw your attention to this problem, the sound also cuts out as the game hits these snags. The on-foot missions in indoor areas fare a little better in terms of the frame rate, but they don't look especially good. There are also some pretty ugly clipping issues here too. Sometimes Marcus' feet will melt right into the ground, and you can buy a cowboy hat that looks bizarre because Marcus' cornrows will often clip right through the brim of the hat, if the hat isn't already floating several inches off his head.         The sound is actually not bad when it isn't skipping and cutting out while you're driving around. The soundtrack includes licensed music from Redman, Blue Oyster Cult, The Misfits, Danzig, GrandMaster Flash, and more. You can rank each song according to your preference, so if you hate one song you can give it zero stars, and it won't come up in the random playlist that you hear as you drive around. There's some good voice talent on hand, but it feels wasted on this mess of a game. Christopher Walken and Laurence Fishburne both have prominent roles here, but it seems as though they were included for the sake of including some celebrity voice talent, not because they actually bring anything to the game. The dialogue in the game is composed almost entirely of the ""F"" word and variations thereof. The profanity is used to the extent that it sounds foolish rather than edgy or tough. The sound effects are all standard gunshots and explosions, and none of them are particularly remarkable. The vehicle sounds are somewhat varied, and it does sound cool when you commandeer some elderly woman's exotic sports car and roar off down the street.      True Crime: New York City should be avoided regardless of whether or not you enjoyed the first True Crime. The gameplay has a few almost-decent spots, but the technical problems far outweigh any faint hope this game ever had of being enjoyable. If you're curious about what a video game looks like before it goes through adequate testing and quality assurance, then by all means give this one a try. Otherwise, stay away, because it's a waste of your time and money.      "
1604,NEON STRUCT,6.0,1,"Deus Ex: that’s Neon Struct whittled down to its essentials. If such a game had existed in 1993, we’d still be talking about it in the sort of reverent, hushed tones we’d use if we had been front-row center for Moses bringing two God-forged tablets down from a mountain. That Neon Struct still has enough going on to remain engaging in 2015 is a testament to the skill involved, but it simply can’t help but suffer under the weight of its own ambitions. The set up is straightforward. You are Jillian Cleary, a woman of mystery who carries out espionage missions for the world’s most conspicuous spy agency against a backdrop of the neon cyberpunk future the 80s told us was coming. During the course of a mission, she discovers that the agency might be working as an illegal arm of whatever the future’s iteration of the Patriot Act looks like. People of interest the world over have been implanted with surveillance chips for the so-called “greater good.” Jillian is tossed in a cell for her silly belief in justice and clarity, but she breaks out and immediately goes to work to try and expose the truth. Some heavy stuff goes on in Neon Struct storywise, which makes it all the more jarring that it’s executed in an aesthetic that's not that different from the original Star Fox. The soundtrack may be a decent enough mixture of Vangelis-lite synth tones and beats, but polygons are intentionally low-res, enemies and NPCs are faceless and voiceless, and although you’ll jetset back and forth across the country, environments always feature the same dark skies, sparse populations, and vague, looming, futuristic machinery. Instead of feeling like a final version, it feels like a pre-production build of a bigger cyberpunk adventure. Stripping away the niceties of generations of graphical advancement is always a good road to take to get to the true heart of whether a game works or not. To wit, Neon Struct is functional as far as the most basic and fundamental stealth mechanics are concerned. There’s even a satisfying purity to it. You can run, jump, climb over obstacles within reason, and perform a silent, cool, Mirror’s Edge-like slide to slip into cover in a hurry. You have no weapons to speak of, though you do get a hacking tool, which allows you to bust open doors by playing a quick game of Breakout on whatever passes for an iPhone in this bright, shiny future. You also get a variety of stims, which give you a short but sweet special effect, like making your footsteps entirely silent or throwing a grenade that immediately teleports you to its location, Nightcrawler-style. A bar at the bottom of the screen shows you your visibility level, dropping to completely empty if you’re invisible, which can happen even if some guards saw you duck into a shady corner just 5 seconds ago. You can knock out guards and toss their bodies into the nearest convenient tidy pile somewhere, but the checklist at the end of each stage frowns upon such violence and offers higher grades to those who can get around without ever resorting to this direct approach. I flunked every single time.   The do-no-harm approach can be done, and there’s plenty of challenge for folks who enjoy pacifist runs. The issue is that there are so few alternatives that don’t involve waiting out guards on a leisurely midnight stroll through an industrial complex or taking a nightstick to the face. Cold-cocking a guard is just sweet, instant relief. Not that the guards are terribly smart to begin with--they’re pretty quick to dispense nightstick justice. Even though you’re equally quick to crumple like a paper towel after taking two or three hits, it’s just as easy to watch them fumble around inches in front of your face and slip out of a hairy situation when they come stalking. This is all perfectly well and good for a cheap-shot app offering quick doses of mindless stealth action on the go. The starting missions are simple sneak-in-sneak-out stealth runs, but Neon Struct has greater ambitions for its world. However, the sparse world building creates some gaping, disappointing holes. The better the story gets, the less the game built around it satisfies its needs. The earliest and best example is Jillian’s jailbreak. She’s just discovered a conspiracy that actually does go all the way to the top. When her grossly misogynistic boss has her tucked away in a detention facility until someone decides it’s neutralizing time, her field handler, an Indian gentleman by the name of Vinod, manages to bust in and hack her door open. This is all fine, but the very quality of the story betrays what you expect when she’s out. Most of the cells around her are empty, save one delusional prisoner. There’s a workout room for guards and a two-way glass room for visitations; otherwise, Jillian’s terrifying Guantanamo is a sterile, blocky hotel crawling with baton-wielding drones and the same three or four recycled textures. There are no indicators to be found besides the dots, question mark, and exclamation points placed over alerted guards, which helps with immersion but makes traversing the labyrinthine corridors a pain. That area’s one of the most frustrating moments in the game for the same reason. The one button allowing you to exit the facility is in a security room that you’d never really identify as a security room except that one tiny, inconspicuous switch is located on a ledge in a room you might entirely overlook.   The sterility might make sense for a government facility, but it makes less sense when the game drops you into big, well-known cities and everything is faceless, abstract, and completely missing a personality (besides the game’s default personality for everything, of course). A sequence on the next level has Jillian attempting to sneak into a medical facility to surgically remove the tracking device in her arm. You walk up to a bed, hit X, a spurt of red stuff hits the screen, and the objective is complete. Again, that’s all well and good for an art project or a proof-of-concept, but it’s not so great when we’re asked to engage with much bigger ideas and action. It’s a double-edged sword, though. Can we really fault a developer for trying to give a very simple game more depth than necessary? It’s a tough call. Neon Struct has the right spirit behind it. It tries to be a rebellious, anti-government tale of capitalism and intelligence communities getting into bed with each other to the detriment of all, and that struggle is far easier to believe than many of gaming’s recent attempts to outdo William Gibson. But with the game-making tools at our disposal, that story should be told using as much fire and verve as can be mustered. Instead, it’s told here with a technical manual’s austerity. The story here acts as little more than the cellophane frames old-schoolers had to paste over their TVs to create a new background for the tiny lights that darted across the screen. Both do their jobs sufficiently, but we no longer have to simply dream of more."
4133,Professor Heinz Wolff's Gravity,4.0,0,"  Gravity can be a curse in everyday life, where the slightest stumble can lead to a nasty skinned knee, but in the safe confines of a video game, the most famous natural phenomena can seem warm and fuzzy. Professor Heinz Wolff's Gravity gives you a virtual playground where you can mess around with mass and momentum, and the physics on display more or less mirror real life. But the puzzles are too mundane to hold your attention for long. There are only so many different ways a rolling ball can interact with a cube, and the levels rarely force you to concoct a clever solution to the obstacles they place in your path. Though it doesn't fall flat on its face, Gravity moves along with such a stumbling, awkward gait that you'll want to give it a wide berth.        The 100 levels in Gravity play out like a diminutive Domino Rally. You place various cubes and poles around the playing field with the goal of knocking any of the objects into a tiny red button. When you think you have everything perfectly situated, you drop a ball from a chute and see if your calculations were correct. Hit the button successfully to move on; miss, and you have some tweaking to do. It's a simple concept made frustrating by unresponsive controls. Just about every action is executed by tapping the touch screen, but the game has a lot of trouble recognizing your commands. Trying to move a piece that has already been placed often calls up the inventory window instead, while attempting to move a small cube can spontaneously erase it from the playing field. With enough determination, you can place every object in the optimal position, but it can take far too much tedious coaxing.      The levels are an odd assortment of slanted pathways, dangerous holes, and speedy loops. Placing your various cubes and poles in the playing field and seeing how they interact with each other is fun at first. You can stack a few blocks on top of each other, building a precarious tower that can topple with just a slight brush, and it can be interesting to try to create a solid structure using just these parts. When done right, the level design requires clever manipulation to reach the end. For instance, in one of the early levels, you must construct a makeshift seesaw to catapult a tiny marble across the screen. Figuring out the perfect balance can be delightfully satisfying, and seeing the tiny ball shoot perfectly across the map is quite cool. However, the novelty of construction quickly dissipates because there are only a few different object types to play around with.     Furthermore, most levels do not require careful planning to pass. More often than not, you can use a cheap trick to reach the button, destroying any sense of challenge or accomplishment. For example, one level has a hard-to-reach vertical loop that lets out right at the button. Trying to use your tools to shoot the ball up that ramp requires an awful lot of patience and planning. Although utilizing the ramp is difficult, it's satisfying trying to figure out a way to take advantage of it. But you can also just skip clever construction and slap together a cheap shortcut solution. If you build a rickety tower underneath the button, a slight bump from a slow-moving ball will cause it to topple, barely nudging the button but still completing the level. The majority of the levels can be completed in this manner. Carefully laying out the perfect pathway is pointless when a cheap solution will so easily open the way to the next challenge. There is no tangible reward for finishing a stage with flair, so it's easy to get in the habit of doing things with as little thought as possible. There are not enough levels that require the meticulous execution that could make this game consistently engaging and enjoyable.         Aside from the 100 standard levels, there are a few more modes to play around with, but they don't add anything worthwhile to the experience. In Sandbox, you can tinker with the ramps and rolling objects without any restrictions, but this mode quickly gets old. Without a goal, there is nothing to draw you in, and there is plenty of time to play around with physics when trying to pass the main levels. The minigames aren't much better. In one, you have a few cubes and poles and must build the highest tower possible in a limited time. Again, because you already do the same basic thing during the main game, it feels slight and uninteresting here without a more rewarding structure. The other two minigames involve shooting balls out of a cannon--to destroy targets or catch in a basket--but they're merely high-score challenges with little replayability. Although having a few different modes to play around with the physics is interesting for a few minutes, without the basic puzzle solving from the main game, that interest quickly fades.     The physics system in Professor Heinz Wolff's Gravity is well executed, but there aren't enough cool ways to take advantage of it. Though there are a few clever puzzles, the majority of the levels can be passed using cheap, unsatisfying methods. Even when you do find an engaging level, the poor controls and small number of different pieces limit the enjoyment you'll get out of solving it. Gravity may look good on paper, but the game itself falls flat.   "
3992,Disney's Atlantis: The Lost Empire,5.0,1," 	Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a first-person shooter that follows the same events as those of the soon-to-be released animated Disney movie, and it casts you as Milo Thatch, a young adventurer who's involved in a turn-of-the-century expedition to find the sunken city of Atlantis. The game starts off aboard your expedition's submarine, the Ulysses, and then moves on to other key areas from the film, including the underwater caverns, the bowels of a volcano, and the ruins of Atlantis itself. In total, Atlantis has 22 single-player levels--none of which will take you any longer than five minutes to complete. While the unusually small levels keep the pacing of the game fairly brisk, you'll also find that it takes about two hours of casual playing time to finish the entire game. Unfortunately, the game has little to keep you interested once you've finished it the first time.   It doesn't take long to complete Atlantis, nor to get frustrated with it. The game seems to assume that you've already seen the movie (which is strange, considering the game was released prior to the film), since a myriad of characters--both good and evil--will talk to your character over his radio without any prior introduction. During a particularly confusing sequence in the game, five different characters will radio in to you, some of which merely chatter on nonsensically, within a span of a single minute. There's also nothing to preface the situations that unfold in the game--the cutscenes in between each mission do nothing more than pan around the level you're about to enter--and as a result, the game's plot quickly becomes confusing. For example, during the first half of Atlantis, you're constantly radioed hints by one of your expedition partners, but halfway through the game, you supposedly meet an Atlantean girl, who then becomes your primary radio contact. However, the game makes no attempt to inform you of that meeting--in one level, she's nonexistent, and in the next, she's your new partner. In light of all this, you'll quickly learn to ignore all radio messages and complete each of the level's overly simply objectives on your own.   Despite the plot's confusing nature, Atlantis plays like a straightforward, uninspired first-person shooter. You're given the option of customizing your controls, even though there's little need to do anything other than shoot, move, and jump. The game has eight weapons, or more accurately, ""tools"" that you'll find throughout the single-player campaign, although you'll rarely use anything other than your primary tool, which is a slow-firing beam weapon of sorts. The first-person perspective doesn't show the item you have equipped, so the only way to tell what you're actually using is through Atlantis' clunky interface, which is nothing more than a toolbar located at the bottom of the screen. Most of the real estate on the toolbar is taken up by two rows of 10 colored lights. The top row represents your health, and the bottom is your ammo--but neither gives an accurately quantifiable indication of your reserves.   Atlantis has other problems. Its graphics look dated, and while some of the levels use vibrant colors, for the most part all the environments are dull and muted. This is unfortunate, considering the game uses the robust LithTech 3D graphics engine, which was recently featured in the impressive shooter No One Lives Forever. Unlike in that game, the levels and characters in Atlantis are rendered using very few polygons, and the textures throughout are small and plain. It's a shooter, but there's no real violence in Atlantis--enemies you shoot simply seem to teleport away. Atlantis almost manages to capture the stylized look and feel of an animated cartoon world--similar to that of a game like Rayman 2--but in the end, it falls short.   The game does offer a number of multiplayer modes, including ""capture the crystal,"" but you'll be hard-pressed to find any players on the scarce active servers that are actually online. For what it's worth, browsing these servers is certainly easy, thanks to the game's inclusion of the GameSpy program. Another redeeming aspect of Atlantis is the inclusion of vehicles that you can control. There are only two levels where this is possible, but these sequences do break up the otherwise monotonous gameplay of the rest of Atlantis.   While the fact that Disney Interactive has created a first-person shooter might seem surprising, the fact that it's not very good may not be. Atlantis has most of the conventions found in a typical shooter--strafing, mouse-look, a variety of weapons, and several multiplayer options--but its lack of a coherent plot, depth of play, or even overall quality prevent it from being worthwhile.      	  "
4367,March of the Penguins,4.0,0,"  Just as the title suggests, the video game rendition of March of the Penguins is based on the award-winning film documentary about emperor penguins. In the game, you help the tuxedo-colored birds migrate inland, forage for food, and care for their young by solving puzzles and navigating mazes set in the harsh Antarctic wasteland. It may seem silly that a company would make a video game out of a documentary, but the puzzles and subject matter actually mesh together fine. However, what isn't fine is that although the game is clearly aimed at younger players, the majority of puzzles require an adult-sized intellect to solve. Anyone that's still in elementary school will probably shut the game off in frustration long before finishing the first chapter. Conversely, anybody with two digits in their age should be able to work through each of the game's 12 puzzles, but they'll likely find no joy in doing so, because the graphics, audio, and overall presentation are geared toward simpler tastes and fall way behind the curve compared to most of the other games that are available for Nintendo's handheld systems.        Half of the game's dozen chapters are reminiscent of the classic puzzle game Lemmings. The penguins, as they are prone to do, have decided to march from one end of the level to the other. It's your job to plant objects along their path that will help the cute birds navigate the various hills and make it to the end without falling into the chilly waters below. Steps let them climb, tents let them bounce really high, snowballs cushion their fall, and so forth. In all, there are eight different objects that you can drag and drop onto the penguins' path. You must have solid spatial-reasoning skills to figure out the right sequence of objects, as well as be able to make decisions quickly, since the penguins are constantly waddling toward their perceived goal. Because this is an E-rated game, they don't die if they fall into the water. They simply reappear at the beginning of the level. However, the trade-off is that you only have a limited amount of time to finish the level. If you have a mishap near the end of the level, there usually won't be enough time left over for any stragglers to rejoin the main group. Factoring in trial and error, it can easily take 30 minutes or more to figure out each Lemmings-style chapter.     The other six chapters are simpler maze-navigation tasks based on key scenes from the film. In one, you have to guide a male penguin through a gauntlet of other penguins while keeping hold of a slippery egg. In another, you have to dive into the water and catch fish while avoiding predators. Compared to the Lemmings-style puzzles, these maze chapters are ridiculously easy.      Some might enjoy the challenge posed by the Lemmings chapters, if only there were any payoff for doing so. Six puzzles is nowhere near enough, considering the typical puzzle game has dozens upon dozens of puzzles. Furthermore, the presentation is much too simple to captivate anyone that has other games at their disposal. The backgrounds are stark and lack color or animation. The penguins are cute and have a smooth waddle, but they're tiny and don't do much except flap and shuffle. It doesn't help that the accompanying audio consists of a few instrumental tunes that loop constantly, along with some basic sound effects that are meant to be footsteps and penguin squawks. Between levels, beautiful photographic stills from the film are shown, along with factoids about the emperor-penguin migration.         The game is available for both the Game Boy Advance and the Nintendo DS. Both versions have the same levels, graphics, and audio. The DS version is easier to play, however, because you can use the stylus to instantly drag and drop objects. The map that's always visible on the upper screen also comes in handy, as does the automatic save feature. By contrast, the GBA game doesn't have a map and makes players write down passwords to maintain progress. Of course, the GBA game does cost a few dollars less.     Not that many people will or should consider buying either version of March of the Penguins. The Lemmings-style puzzles are much too difficult for younger players, while older players will be turned off by how bland and short-lived the overall product is. The silly thing isn't that they made a video game out of a documentary film. The silly thing is that they made it too difficult for one audience and too insubstantial for the other.    "
1312,Ghostbusters,3.0,0,"To put that in context, I actually like the last-gen Ghostbusters games, including the similarly themed four-way, very arcade-like, Sanctum of Slime. It's slight and disposable, but it nailed the old-school multiplayer groove. It wasn’t a particularly good game, but it was far and away better than this one.This new Ghostbusters has none of the redeeming qualities of its predecessor. This romp takes place after the events of the new movie. You don’t play any of the that film's Ghostbusters though, instead taking the role of a squad of rookies (just as in the previous game). They’re a bit more diverse than usual, at least--two women and two men fill the team--but they’re standard archetypes for a multiplayer twin-stick shooter: the big guy is a mini-gun carrying tank, while his buddy is the assault rifle-carrying smart guy. The two ladies offer up proton pack versions of a shotgun and dual pistols.With a full compliment of human players at the controls, they make a fairly well-rounded team, even if their personalities fail to make a meaningful impression. The game takes you all over New York City and, eventually, beyond. There are treks through a graveyard, cruise ship, hotel, and other haunted locales across 10 stages. Each level plays out the same way: you fight a bunch of the same, smaller ghost baddies, then some larger ones who require switching to the traditional proton beam to weaken them further so you can trap them, and eventually a pattern-based boss ghost. This formula is serviceable at first, but it doesn't take long before you start to feel like you're merely going through the motions, completing uninspiring chores.You can also switch to the P.K.E. meter during non-combative moments to find secret goodies hidden throughout the level. This dual set-up is the standard boilerplate twin-stick shooter template, which isn’t necessarily a terrible thing. The problem here is that Ghostbusters somehow manages to suck the life out of both its own license and gameplay.To be more specific, Ghostbusters is mind-numbingly boring. Levels are huge--too large for this kind of game--and filled mostly with empty space and confusing, seemingly random designs. Some levels can take over an hour, devoid of interesting environments or fun challenges--it's enough to put you to sleep.There are half-baked elements that might have improved things with better execution. The upgrade system lets you increase weapons and stats of each character, but the characters start out so ponderously slow that increasing their speed becomes a priority. Even after these upgrades, though, the controls are unresponsive, and shooting ghosts remains cloying.While each level tends to introduce a couple new enemies, there’s very little variety overall. You encounter the same larger mid-boss opponents ad nauseam as the drawn-out levels progress. Even with that sense of repetition, you spend most of your time aimlessly walking around more than actually battling spirits. There are huge arena-sized areas with virtually nothing in them. The P.K.E. meter may initially inspire you to search every corner of a level, but there’s little payoff when you do.And although Ghostbusters uses the Unreal 4 engine, its aesthetics don't redeem its poor accompanying factors. It’s trying hard to summon the cel-shaded animated look of Borderlands, but isn’t up to the task. The mundane looking ghosts are uninspired and landscapes are basic. The soundtrack, however, evokes the proper nostalgia, making it one of the only standout qualities in an otherwise substandard game. The overall score is surprisingly dramatic, making it much better than any other aspect of the game.In the end, Ghostbusters has rare moments when it doesn't feel like an utter waste of time. But it's mostly a bizarre slog through mostly empty, overly cumbersome levels full of extreme repetition. Even for devoted fans of the films and four-player co-op shooters, Ghostbusters is a disappointment."
3789,Puzzlegeddon,5.0,1,"  The Book of Revelations may have foretold the end of the world, but it failed to mention that the Earth's ultimate destruction would come by way of benign-looking puzzle pieces. Puzzlegeddon brings to life the mythical fire and brimstone in a competitive puzzle game that urges players to forcibly attack their opponents by chaining together strings of high-scoring combos. It's a concept pulled straight from the popular Puzzle Quest, but Puzzlegeddon feels painfully shallow compared to its hugely successful forbearer. Whether you play against computer-controlled bots or able-minded humans, you're confined to a series of one-off matches. There is neither a story mode to play through nor character statistics to build and form through time. Thus, you are left with a serviceable though forgettable experience that is moderately fun in five-minute bursts but lacks any incentive to come back for another round.         Colored blocks must strictly adhere to their destiny. By coming into contact with their like-colored brothers, they disappear in a puff of smoke, banished from view forever. In Puzzlegeddon, you slide these blocks along a 6-by-6 square to form a match of five of the same color, and when you achieve that goal, you tap a button to make them vanish. By creating chains and combos, you also improve your score exponentially. The core mechanics work well. By allowing you to decide when you want to initiate a combo--instead of the game automatically making blocks disappear as soon as they touch--you can carefully build big combos that would simply not be possible in other games. However, sliding blocks quickly becomes dull because the game has so little variety. There are only four different colors to worry about, and there aren't any wild-card blocks or other tricks to throw a wrench in your combo making. It makes for a predictable experience that quickly becomes old.     The purpose of all this block chaining is to build up meters that allow you to strike down your opponents. Depending on what color blocks you dispose of, you put points into one of four different abilities: attack, disrupt, defense, and boost. Each of these abilities has three different levels, giving you access to more powerful maneuvers if you have enough patience to bide your time. For instance, the lowest attack level gives you just one weak missile to launch at an opponent; the second level splits that one missile into three deadly bombs; and the fully powered level lets you unleash one giant missile. One strange aspect is that you cannot choose which level attack you unleash. If you have your attack meter completely full, you have to send out your huge missile. Letting you decide if you want to drop the big one or three small missiles instead would have given the game more flexibility. This ultimately limits the strategic element, making it much easier to predict what your opponents will do.     Even against a group of up to 5 human foes (online only), matches lack the explosive appeal you might imagine accompanying a puzzle-themed take on Armageddon. Defense and attack are far more important than boost and disrupt, which means you have to make a concerted effort to match green and red colored blocks to keep those meters perpetually full. As long as you have your defensive meter maxed out, you make it extremely difficult to get attacked because you can repel any missile that comes your way. This powerful maneuver gives you immunity against even the most deadly missiles. Because it is so effective in waylaying any threat, the balance of matches is heavily slanted in favor of forming green chains, making an already predictable game even less exciting. After three or four matches, you'll have seen every combination of attack and defense possible, giving you little reason to go back for more end-of-the-world puzzle action.         Aside from the standard battle matches, there is only one other mode in which to compete. Poison Peril swaps out the brightly colored blocks for ones adorned with a skull, casket, and other gothic imagery. You no longer have opponents or colored meters to worry about either. Instead, you have a specific objective you must complete, such as forming a certain number of chains or disposing of every block with a bat on it. In this mode, you have to deal with evil blocks as well. If you form a chain with a poisoned block nearby, you damage yourself. You can only take so many hits before your game is finished, which creates a feeling of tension as you carefully weigh all your options. Poison Peril is more interesting than the standard matches, but it too has limited appeal. Your total score is based on how many levels you pass, but you must start at ground zero every time. There is no way to begin during the later stages, which is when things become more challenging, and the easy early levels aren't much fun to replay.     Puzzlegeddon is far too simple to hold the attention of puzzle aficionados for very long. With only four different colors to manage, the puzzle-sliding aspects are too easy and give players little challenge in their quest to form like-colored matches. The battle elements are way too predictable, limiting players strategies to such a strong extent that every match blends together with all your previous trials. Without any story mode to speak of or even a hint of persistent game mechanics, Puzzlegeddon is too shallow to make more than a mild splash on the puzzle landscape.   "
4382,Blair Witch Volume III: The Elly Kedward Tale,4.0,0,"Blair Witch Volume 3: The Elly Kedward Tale is an action-adventure game that's heavy on action and light on adventure. In the game, you play as a character named Jonathan Prye - an 18th-century witch hunter who uses flintlock pistols, muskets, and powerful magic artifacts to hunt evil spirits. Unfortunately, Prye's adventures aren't anywhere near as exciting as they might sound because of the game's poor control, its awkward camera angles, and its simplistic and repetitive story. That is to say, Blair Witch Volume 3's story and adventure-game elements are so weak that they're negligible; it instead relies heavily on action and combat - and thanks to the game's various problems, these action sequences can be extremely frustrating.   Blair Witch Volume 3 is powered by the Nocturne engine - the same graphics engine that powered both the previous Blair Witch games as well as last year's horror-themed game of the same name. And as in the previous games, in Blair Witch Volume 3, the Nocturne engine shows its age. Volume 3 has the same drab, plain look as the previous two games, and it even recycles some of the previous games' scenery. Volume 3 is filled with dimly-lit areas that rely heavily on the Nocturne engine's notable ability to render real-time shadows and lighting - presumably for atmosphere - but a few flitting shadows hardly compensate for the game's blocky polygonal characters or for its other visual problems.   Volume 3 is plagued with many of the same camera and control problems as the original Nocturne. In many areas of the game, you'll find that your view changes multiple times, and nearly always without warning. Unfortunately, other than these often excessively frequent and seemingly arbitrary changes, the game's camera is fixed - you can't take control of it or manipulate it to get a better view of the action, despite that many of the default views are themselves awkward and occasionally difficult to navigate. Instead, you'll find yourself at the mercy of the game's camera, which will change views whenever it decides to - and each time it does, it pauses the game briefly. And these jarring pauses make navigating certain areas frustrating and make the game's already problematic action sequences even more so.   Unlike the previous two games, Volume 3 is focused mainly on action sequences - in other words, drawing your pistol, rifle, or magic weapon and fighting enemies. Unfortunately, the awkward camera angles do little to help the game's poor control scheme, which lets you turn far more quickly than you can move forward or sideways. This isn't much of a problem in the earlier parts of the game, since, like the previous games, Volume 3 has an auto-aim feature that will let you automatically draw a bead on your enemies - it's not the least bit challenging or entertaining but not terribly frustrating either. However, some of the more difficult fights against tougher monsters require you to move about while trying to aim, which can be exceptionally frustrating because of the controls, the clumsy camera angles, and the jarring scene transitions.   There's not a lot of variety in the action. You'll begin the game with a pistol and an iron cross for close combat, and later you'll acquire a rifle, a fiery cross, a staff that calls lightning bolts from the sky, and other magic weapons and spells. None of these weapons is especially satisfying to use. Throughout the game, you'll fight a few interesting creatures, like demons and winged spirits - but you'll spend much of your time killing the game's ubiquitous, stupid, and slow-moving zombies. Unfortunately, you can't just avoid fighting these boring enemies, since you need to kill them to pick up the health and ammunition power-up items they inexplicably leave behind.   Otherwise, there's very little to Blair Witch Volume 3. There are hardly any real puzzles to speak of; instead, the game's adventure elements consist largely of talking to a character, then either running through the zombie-infested Blair woods to fetch an item or to speak to another character. The game's voice acting is passable at best, and character interactions with the overbearing and world-weary Prye are mostly shallow and long-winded; it's often painfully clear that they serve only a few real purposes - either to give you your next weapon or to give you tasks to perform. These tasks might have been less tedious if either they or the characters that assign them were more interesting. As it is, most of the interaction consists of excessively lengthy, insubstantial dialogue.   Though the premise behind Blair Witch Volume 3 - being a witch-hunter who hunts the titular witch - may seem intriguing, the game itself fails to deliver on all accounts. Its precious few adventure-game elements are paper-thin. Instead, the game relies heavily on poorly executed action sequences - and neither these nor the game's ambient and forgettable music are the least bit exciting or creepy. Volume 3 is actually longer than either of the two previous games. But the game is longer - and far less enjoyable - because you'll spend more time shooting zombies or reloading your last saved game to try to finish off a difficult foe than you did in the previous games. So if you must get one of the three Blair Witch games, do yourself a favor and don't get this one."
2196,XCOM: Enemy Unknown,6.0,1,"  XCOM: Enemy Unknown - Slingshot asks the question: is more of the same enough to satisfy you? If so, and if you don't mind starting a new game from scratch, then you already know what you need to know about the first major downloadable content for this great turn-based strategy game. For $6.99, you get three smartly designed levels, the latter two of which keep tensions appropriately high as you encounter the same horrifying aliens that hovered ominously over the original game. The DLC also provides certain tweaks that open up powerful technology, such as the fusion core, earlier than you would normally expect, and it also adds some cosmetic customization options to fiddle with. But ultimately, Slingshot is an hour's worth of ""more,"" and it struggles to find a worthwile place in the XCOM project.        Aesthetics aside, the mission plays out exactly as you would expect for an early-game Enemy Unknown mission; you lead your squad through the mission, fending off almond-eyed sectoids, facing a spiderlike chrysalid, and ultimately escorting Zhang to safety. The central mission is structurally the most interesting of the three, having squad members sprint down the corridor of a passenger train and activating transponders while protecting their flanks--and taking position above, if you prefer. Why the hurry? The objective is timed, so you must perform the necessary activations before you reach your turn limit, an aspect that adds additional tension to an otherwise straightforward mission.      "
3669,Rampage: Total Destruction,5.0,1,"  The only thing more depressing than a remake of a classic game that isn't very good is a remake of a classic game that simultaneously isn't good on its own merits, and also manages to bring you to the realization that the classic game on which it's based isn't as good as you remember it being. Midway's Rampage series took arcades by storm back in the late '80s, providing players with the ability to storm through various metropolitan areas of the world and destroy them with gargantuan monsters. It was the kind of simplistic, button-mashy fun that could fly in a simpler time, a game designed specifically for mindless entertainment and to keep you inserting quarters. There hasn't been a new version of Rampage in half a decade, and after playing Rampage: Total Destruction, the newest installment in the series, it's not tough to see why. The problem is that the gameplay simply hasn't evolved over time. You wander around the same types of two-dimensional environments (though now they're in pseudo-3D), punching the same buildings and eating the same people that you did back in the '80s. Now, that style of gameplay simply feels punishingly repetitive, rather than goofy and fun. But whereas the PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions of Rampage that were released several months ago slavishly dedicated themselves to the same brand of repetitious button mashing that the arcade games did, the new Wii version tries to futz with the formula by adding in new motion-sensing controls. Unfortunately, these controls feel just as half-baked and irritating as the rest of the game.        The premise for Rampage: Total Destruction is as simplistic as any of the previous games to bear the name. Giant monsters roam from city to city, busting down every building that comes into their path so they can move onto the next block and do it all over again. Total Destruction toys with bringing in a bit of a plot to the proceedings, setting up the creation of the game's various monsters via a failed taste test of ""Scum Soda,"" which mutates all its subjects horribly. But that story never extends beyond the opening cutscene and is completely secondary to you busting tall buildings as if they were chiffarobes or something. The three main monsters from the old games--George, Lizzie, and Ralph (a gigantic gorilla, lizard, and werewolf, respectively)--are on hand for this version, as well as a whole host of other monsters, like a Cyclops, a giant fishman, a giant squidman, a big rock thing, something that might be a jackalope, and others. However, no matter what monster you choose, you're basically playing the same character throughout. Each monster has a few specific stats that supposedly make them better for jumping, running, or smashing, but the tangibility of these differences is minimal at best, and the moves are the same across the board for every monster.     Those moves include, and are basically exclusive to, climbing up and punching, kicking, or stomping buildings, picking up and smashing cars, picking up and eating people, and a few special moves that can be earned as you spend more time playing as a specific monster. The basic controls for these moves are mostly mapped to the Wii Remote. You can pull off some stomps and smashes by smacking the remote up and down like a toddler with a toy hammer, and do wind-up punches by waving the remote back and forth as if you were trying to hail a cab. The A button handles basic punches, B jumps, and you move around the environment using the control stick on the Nunchuk. There are a few variances on the formula, like combining jumps and motions to make new attacks, but basically, you hammer, you wave, and you're bored. The attacks just aren't interesting, and the controls barely feel as though they tie in to the animations you're performing.     Each block has anywhere between four and 10 buildings to bust up, and all the while, cops, SWAT members, and military types will come after you with guns, helicopters, tanks, and the like. Apart from the occasional breaks you'll need to take to bust up the helicopters and tanks, there's really not anything more to the gameplay than simply breaking down buildings, moving to the next block, and repeating the process over and over again until you've destroyed the entire city. If the game gave you more attacks, or even more to do with the attacks you already have, it might be OK, but it doesn't. The 2D-plane environments give the game a constantly recycled feel. You don't feel like you're destroying a unique environment every time--you feel like you're destroying the same environment over and over again, because in effect, you are.     While the game really isn't much fun at all from a single-player perspective, there's enough multiplayer action to make things at least a tad more interesting. Up to two players can play the main campaign mode cooperatively, but there are also king-of-the-city and king-of-the-world modes available for up to four players. Both are basically the same thing as the main campaign, but with the specific goal of competing for the highest score. In any multiplayer arena, you can go up and attack fellow monsters to try to knock them off their game, but there's not much you can do save for punching in their general direction. No cool special attacks or anything for some good, old-fashioned monster-on-monster violence. Again, the multiplayer only adds a bit of distinction to the overall experience. It's just inherently more fun to destroy things with someone else in the room to help out. It doesn't make the gameplay any less repetitive or inevitably dull.     Graphically, Rampage on the Wii looks just marginally better than its GameCube counterpart. The game does a decent job of presenting itself, for what it's worth. The monsters look quite good. They animate well, move nicely in the context of the environments, and are creatively designed. The pseudo-3D environments also look nice enough. No high-res textures or special lighting effects are to be found, but the buildings break apart well, and things explode nicely. Again, the worst thing about it is that it basically looks like a GameCube game, with next to no added bells or whistles. The audio is a little more hit-and-miss. There are plenty of monstrous roars, thunderous smashes, and obnoxious belching, but it all repeats way, way too much. There just aren't enough sound effects to offset the amount of repetitive action going on, leading to constant and incessant repetition of the same annoying sounds. The soundtrack is pretty generic, though it generally jibes with the action pretty well. Voice acting is barely present, but what's there works well enough.        Perhaps the saddest thing about Total Destruction is its inclusion of the original Rampage and Rampage: World Tour arcade games as bonus extras. It's not sad because they're bad emulations of the original games; in fact, they're pretty spot-on. The problem is that being able to directly compare these ancient games to the new one, and seeing so little forward progress between the two, is just crushing. Not to mention that these old games simply don't hold up that well in this day and age.     The fact that Rampage: Total Destruction was already a pretty mediocre game to begin with means that a Wii version requires some serious revamping and widespread improvements to make it something worthwhile. No such luck, it seems. Yes, you can hammer the Wii control up and down to make with the smashing, but this act does exactly zero to make the game any more playable, or any less annoyingly repetitive. At best, Total Destruction is a brief distraction. At worst, it's an obsolete relic from too many years ago that now, on the Wii, seems even more antiquated and out of place.  "
2935,TrackMania 2 Canyon,8.0,2,"TrackMania fans, this description is surely familiar. The series stays true to its roots with the sequel, with an emphasis on quick-fire segments of gameplay, all neatly tied together in a package for the social media age.         Getting into TrackMania 2 is a simple affair. Solo play consists of 65 tracks, the majority of which are unlocked by obtaining medals. You load up a track, start your engine, and then keep playing until you set a time you're happy with. It's great if you're interested only in score chasing, although it's far from a shallow game. Each track has been expertly designed with the leaderboards in mind. Nailing the perfect racing line to achieve the best time takes practice and experimentation as you figure out how to cut corners and start drifts earlier.     Learning the best routes around stages is never a chore. The majority of tracks last anywhere from 18 to 40 seconds; they're short A-to-B sprints that take you around hairpin bends and over dizzying jumps. Frequently you find yourself driving up walls or drifting vertically around a quarter pipe. These stages are short, but the desire to stay on a given track, chasing the best time you can, is encouraged at every point. Each track offers up a bronze, silver, and gold medal to obtain, as well as an official time to set. These times can be challenged every five minutes, with a timer in the bottom right corner counting down until your next attempt. Setting an official time awards you with skill points based on how well you performed overall and contributes to your online leaderboard ranking.      Racing around the tracks is fun and breezy, thanks in part to the superb handling and easy learning curve when it comes to drifting. There's only one car type, so the focus is on learning the tracks rather than worrying about which vehicle to use. This gives TrackMania 2 Canyon the feel of a puzzle game as much as a racer, and it's great that when a friend beats your time you know that he's driving the same car that you do. Keyboard controls are tight, with subtle manoeuvring and wide drifts being easy to pull off with the arrow keys. Using a gamepad is even better, because the full analogue controls lend themselves well to the game. You frequently make twitch adjustments to your racing line, and either control method is conducive to this.         Trying to set the best time can be frustrating, but usually in a ""just one more go"" way. A few of the tracks are just plain annoying, though, as some of the longer ones end with a jump or a turn that can easily blindside you. But the immediacy of restarting (hit a button and you're instantly back on the starting grid) makes even the most irritating tracks seem reasonable. Less fun are the lap races, which occur every fifth track. These five-lap affairs are decent enough, but if you're going for gold, then they can feel like a bit of a slog when you mess up towards the end of the fifth lap. The variety and length of the A-to-B tracks make them far more entertaining.      There are no physical opponents on the track. You can choose a ghost to race against from either the preset AI ghosts, your own favourite replay, or the replay of someone on your buddies list who has set a better official time than you. Usually there are three vehicles on the track: you, the ghost you chose to race against, and the ghost of your last attempt. Multiplayer is similar, in that while you can see other cars, they take the form of ghosts. The main mode is Time Attack, in which you and various opponents race on a series of tracks, with five minutes to set the best time you can. It serves as a fun competition as well as a learning tool, being able to see the racing line that a car ahead of you is taking without having to worry about overtaking it yourself. There are other modes, like Laps and Cup, which see you racing directly against opponents, but finding a server doing anything other than Time Attack is currently nigh on impossible. Luckily there's the option to create your own and invite friends. These multiplayer options are also available to play locally, either in turns or in split-screen.         There's a big focus on community in TrackMania 2, and this is reflected in ManiaPlanet, the Facebook-esque platform from which the game launches. Through this interface you can see your current ranking and the overall leaderboards, and you can even read the game's forums. When friends set a time which beats yours, you're sent a message alerting you, and by clicking on it you can immediately challenge their ghost. It's a neat  idea for a user interface, although it could do with a little fixing up; it's not the easiest thing to navigate, and it's only after playing around with it for a while that you fully get to grips with it. It's strangely contrary to the accessibility of the game.         Customization and user-created content have always been staples of TrackMania, and it's no different here. There's a track editor, which lets you create tracks to share online, and a selection of paint tools with which to customize your cars. The track editor thankfully offers a Simple editing mode, as well as the more complex Advanced mode, which is difficult to get comfortable with at first. The same applies to the replay editor, which is reminiscent of professional editing software. Luckily, each track has default camera angles for replays too, so saving decent movies (which can also be shared or converted to video) is entirely possible with no editing ability.      The complexity of some of the features is the main reason TrackMania 2: Canyon may be off-putting to some. Make no mistake: it's to the game's benefit that it's customizable and open to modding. But unless you're prepared to go to external sites to find new tracks, or you have image editing or 3D modelling skills in order to make decals and new cars, then it's possible to feel as if you're not getting as much out of the game as you could be. Very few aspects of the more advanced components are handled in-game. Grabbing a new track requires you to find it on the Internet or receive the file from someone and extract it into the correct folder which can be accessed via the launcher program. The same is true of cars and most of the replays of official times that are downloaded if you challenge them via the buddy list. Thankfully there's the option to create a ""pack"" which can be shared, containing multiple tracks and cars, so each individual file doesn't have to be downloaded separately.      Despite this, there's still a highly accessible time trial game here. Given TrackMania 2: Canyon's cheap price, it's a good value even if you're interested only in the vanilla solo and multiplayer modes. It's also a great-looking game. Dust kicks up as you race across canyon floors, and the exaggerated damage model causes cars to bend and buckle into glorious wrecks. Thankfully, the fairly basic soundtrack can be replaced with your own music, and custom maps can have their own songs attached to them.         TrackMania 2: Canyon is a game that tries to cater to as many players as possible, even if the gulf between the simple and the advanced is rather wide. Whether you're heavily investing in the community aspect, or simply racing the different tracks to set some times and save a few sweet-looking replays, the game is loads of fun. While it's hard to shake the feeling that some things, like content sharing, could be a little less slapdash, it's also hard to ignore the potential for community expansion. It's not really a game for those who like their racers to be a little more grounded and a little more focused on progression, but it manages to be rewarding even though you're just replaying the same track over and over, trying to beat a ghost by a millisecond. TrackMania 2: Canyon makes it clear that it's the taking part that counts, but it proves that taking part and then winning is even more of a thrill.   "
920,Total War Saga: Thrones of Britannia,8.0,2,"One of the core systems in Total War’s latest is the idea that your kingdom’s legacy is everything, for better or for worse. This isn’t revolutionary for the series, considering previous installments were fixated on the Roman Empire and its own bag of patriarchal succession woes. But the laser focus on lineage, loyalty and responsibility are more pronounced in Thrones of Britannia. It’s nothing short of engaging when all of its gears are in motion, and making sure that those gears are well-oiled is where the challenge lies. As is usual for Total War games, you’ve got to strike the right balance between warmongering and good governance. Your success is measured best by how your townsfolk are feeling, and they react organically to your decisions when you make them. If you lower taxes, they’ll undoubtedly get a boost to their satisfaction. If you’re not zealous enough, or too zealous for too long, their thirst for conflict will decline. If multiple things go wrong at once, you’ll potentially face a peasant uprising just as you’re knee-deep in a Viking-slaying sojourn.Depending on the faction that you’ve chosen to play as, you’ll also have a number of other competing concerns vying for your attention, along with a corresponding cultural perk. Each cultural faction (there are five, each with two subsets) has its own way of charting the rise or fall of your empire, and they’re all distinctly different. For example, if you’re playing as the Welsh, protecting your culture will be the key factor to watch. If you’re walking on the wild side and playing as the Vikings, then it’s a matter of making sure that lesser kingdoms recognize your military accomplishments via lavish tributes. Keeping those respective meters high for your chosen faction will lead to positive increases in universal metrics like loyalty or even the melee abilities of your units. The differences between the cultures feel much more than skin-deep when these systems come into play, and they each guarantee a unique experience which incentivizes players to try their hand at other factions once they’ve tasted success.These integral bits and bobs are also affected by the actions of your generals and governors, and Thrones of Britannia does its best to give you the tools you need to be politically savvy. Your henchmen are important, but acquiring them is now a precise science. Unlike the chance acquisition of previous titles, you get to place a follower into someone’s retinue when they level up. These peons assist you with improving specific empire metrics. If you’re struggling to feed your troops, perhaps give a governor a well-trained forager. If you’re looking to crack skulls in battle, then assign a Champion to a general for a little more steel. However, it's hard to keep your loyal subjects truly happy even if you make sure that they’re prepared for anything that the Isles may throw their way. Why? Well, they’re only human, and humans get greedy.The aforementioned cautionary tale of Ricsige the Overambitious is just one of the many vipers in your kingdom’s nest that the game can throw at you. If your inner circle are too good at their jobs, their influence may eclipse your own and lead to some nasty confrontations if you don’t use espionage to discredit them in front of the populous. If you let them get too unhappy, then their loyalty suffers and they’ll make off with an army if you fail to placate them. Thankfully, the game gives you choices: You can secure loyalty through bribes, torture, or by doing what any good King would do, giving them estates. If things are looking particularly dire, you can even declare a new heir, though it pays to be cautious about the riff-raff that you’re letting into the royal bloodline. Managing the expectations of your inner circle is a balancing game that has surprising depth considering the immediacy with which your kingdom bears the brunt of your choices. It’s a credit to Creative Assembly that granting titles and destroying marriages never feels like busy work no matter how big your posse gets.If you thought that your sons would be tough to manage, then your vassal states and potential enemies are an even bigger headache. While there’s no need to negotiate over imports and exports anymore, you still have to do your bit in ensuring good neighborly relations. You can suggest peace treaties, broker mutual military access, and even marry off an argumentative maiden to a frosty sovereign to appease them. You can also just as easily put an end to a friendship; each faction will react in either a positive or negative way to what you may see as a minor act (i.e. walking through someone else’s forest), and things can quickly turn into a diplomatic minefield. End up making a wrong choice and breaking an alliance? You’re signing yourself up for a beating from the very same monarchs that you kicked to the curb. While it can sometimes feel like you’re being pigeon-holed into specific diplomatic relationships depending on your story missions, the general freedom that you get to flip the bird at petty rulers adds a welcome touch of brevity to the proceedings.For those who are chomping at the bit for combat, this sort of confrontation probably sounds more like a blessing than an indictment. Thankfully, Thrones of Britannia maintains the series' satisfying war mechanics. Formations for your units make their comeback in Thrones of Britannia, so if you sloughed through Warhammer and Warhammer II wanting the micro-play of the early Total War games, you’re in luck. The loop is conceptually familiar even to the uninitiated: you line your men up, point them at the enemy, and send them to meet either early deaths or victory spoils. Some factions have a leg-up on others at different points of the game, but the usual suspects of cavalry, ranged infantry, and sword-wielders populate the majority of your ranks.Every location is rendered in great detail, even though the game relies on an aged engine. The camera’s range here is welcome; you can view the action from the top down or you can get up close and personal with the carnage. AI enemies respond reasonably intelligently to the actions of your troops--this isn’t a case where they throw themselves against your pointy weapons until they stop moving. However, there are some instances of the AI becoming prematurely spooked by aggression, and their defensive maneuvers of hiding behind trees and scattering unprompted can feel repetitive after consecutive skirmishes. Despite that, the mechanics around preparing for sieges and the economic minigame of raising your armies pad out the combat experience well as a whole, even if other elements of the game are more abrupt.One of those such elements is the act of seeking victory itself. There are Short Victories and Long Victories, and they encompass the full gamut of empire metrics: you can win by getting really famous, controlling a certain portion of the map, or simply by sticking around long enough to give the Viking horde what for. Getting a Short Victory can sometimes feel like an accident; a win is in sight if you manage to inherit a foreign landmass, and this can happen through no effort of your own if your chosen target is unlucky enough to incur the wrath of someone stronger. However, the factions all have their own starting difficulty indication that appears to be mostly accurate, so it’s easy to see where you should jump in if you have any doubts about whether you’ll be sufficiently challenged.Once you’ve gained a victory, the forward momentum of the game seems to slow. While you may previously have been fed missions to move events along, your trusty advisor seems happy to largely occupy the back seat of your chariot while you tramp around Britain looking for people to stick swords into. If you’re lucky enough to have fallen into multiple win conditions, you’ll likely find it hard to motivate yourself to keep going; the AI may not be strong enough to keep up. On the other hand, it’s just as easy to taste only defeat in a playthrough, as the AI is quick to bare its teeth and to close in on weak or unguarded settlements. Regardless, it’s prudent to not take victory for granted: a decisive win could spell an exhausted army ripe for the routing before an in-game year passes.Thrones of Britannia is an exciting experience despite the cuts to integral components of the Total War series, such as city planning hinging on military needs, specific building customization, and expanded intrigue options. But this has given Creative Assembly room to focus on enhancing parts of the strategy experience that aren’t quite as impenetrable to newcomers, and to allow the series to return to some of the beloved parts of previous historical games to balance out its newer, slimmer form. While there are minor issues with AI, and pacing suffers when you’ve comfortably gotten the upper hand, this is still a worthy and engaging contribution to the Total War stable that has successfully taken its cues from history’s winners and losers alike."
3421,Start the Party!,6.0,1,"  Much like the EyeToy: Play games that were released for the PlayStation 2, Start the Party is a collection of minigames that you play by moving your arms around in front of the TV. The main difference here is that the PS2 games required only an EyeToy camera to play, whereas Start the Party requires both the newer PlayStation Eye camera and a Move motion controller. You can see yourself onscreen at all times while playing, and it's great that the motion controller in your hand appears to take on a different form for each minigame. There's fun to be had here, especially for younger players, but it doesn't take long for the same minigames to start repeating and for Start the Party to feel overpriced at $40 as a result.         Other than choosing how many rounds you want to play and how many of you are playing on which of the three difficulty levels, the only other option in multiplayer is to either have your minigames selected randomly or to choose them yourself from a list of just nine. That same option is available to you in solo play, where the lack of competition means that the action gets old fast. A much better (and incidentally, your only other) option for solo play is Survival mode. Here, an energy bar of sorts starts out full and indicates how much time you have left to play. If you fail to complete an objective by dropping a topping that you're trying to catch on a pizza base, for example, you lose time. If you complete an objective successfully, though, such as waking up a sleeping bird by frantically ringing a bell, you add valuable seconds. The game is over when you have no time remaining, at which point your overall survival time is entered onto a leaderboard.     actual party started. With its colorful presentation, instantly accessible minigames, and responsive controls, Start the Party really doesn't do much wrong; the problem is just that it doesn't do enough. If you're looking for a game to entertain the family for an hour on a holiday, Start the Party fits the bill. But if you're looking for something to play more than a handful of times a year and is fun to play on your own, as well as with friends, this isn't the party for you.  "
225,Cat Cafe Manager,5.0,1,"The setup is a familiar one. You're new to town and have been given a plot of land. Naturally, you do what any sensible landowner would do: begin to build a small business that combines two of humanity's greatest idols: brunch and cats. Immediately upon setting off to build the cafe of your dreams, the bubbly music and adorable 2D art direction provide the lax vibes you might expect from a game like this.But just as soon, Cat Cafe inundates you with messy, text-only tutorials. It's a heap of information dumped at your lap, which may be a rough opening for any player, but especially the younger or less-experienced crowd such a game may attract. Still, once the busy UI has been deciphered, the game's economy is actually well-designed, demanding you cater your cafe to different clientele to serve different needs.For example, if you need more building supplies to expand the square footage of your cafe, you need to advertise to the town's punks and ensure you're serving their favorite dishes and drinks for maximum satisfaction. If instead it's ingredients and recipes you need, you'll want to get witches to visit. There are six customer types in all, and each has their own currency, as well as their own wants and needs in order to have a lovely time in your cafe.This business-side consideration smartly extends into several aspects of the game. You'll need more than just the right selection of items for the right customers. You'll also need to adopt and train the right stray cats to cuddle up on customers' laps, befriend particular locals, and hire and train the right staff to ensure they can cook well, serve quickly, and, yes, even clean up cat pee.In between business days, you'll start new projects--skills, really--such as gaining more staff or chair slots, restock on food supplies and cat toys, and further enhance your cafe with more stylish wallpaper, prettier plants, and snazzier tables and chairs. Eventually, your once-modest cafe will toss out the mismatched decor in favor of a consistent theme such as a bewitching bistro, a hipster hangout, or a straight-up dive bar.Collectively, all of these considerations pour into an overall cafe rating, and each day you'll receive customer ratings from every single person who patronizes your store. It's a lovely in-game economy that guarantees there's always something to do, at least for the first dozen or so hours.It's just too bad none of it really matters. You see, that cafe rating has little effect on anything. Your mismatched dining sets may bring down your overall rating, and a witch who was denied her beloved pretzel may mean she didn't have a great time, but Lemonade Stand this is not. Nothing is of any real consequence in Cat Cafe Manager.During my time with the game, my almost three-year-old daughter became obsessed with it, so in times when I wasn't playing, I'd let her mess around. Naturally, this meant some menu items weren't restocked and some customers left unhappy. Certainly even some of that aforementioned cat pee went unmopped, I'm sorry to say. But when I'd take the game back for myself, I'd find I was nonetheless rich in its many currencies and resources. Because your hired staff behave autonomously, the game essentially plays itself once you bring in some coworkers a few hours in. Sure, the coffee machine may break down, but customers always settle for a backup order, even if it's simply a glass of water in the most dire of cases.In this way, the game's laissez-faire design is a bit too hands-off, revealing this isn't so much a proper restaurant simulation, but rather set dressing for an admittedly adorable game about cats and coffee. There's no way to fail and no way even to really succeed at any notable level, as the number of customers you serve in a day comes down solely to the number of chairs you can purchase and place in your cafe.Skill points are doled out liberally, and the money, in its many forms, will keep flowing whether you have a hopping mega-Starbucks or a rundown assembly line of herbal teas and kitty pees. All of this means your enjoyment of the game may come down to how much freedom you want. I wanted more than what's here, but I can also squint and appreciate the anti-game that Cat Cafe Manager really ends up being. Younger players may need help getting past the game's initial pamphlet of explainers, but after that, they can enjoy the game without fail states or a storyline to impede them.One thing that will bug players of all sorts, however, is the faulty decorating mode. Tiles are placed square by square like in The Sims. When expanding your square footage, the cursor gets lost behind already existing walls. Items such as artwork that may have been hanging on a wall oddly do not move with the wall, leaving them in the middle of the floor. This even strangely changes how to use the cursor, as to reset decor after its attached wall has moved, you must click the tile below the item, rather than the item's tile itself, which is how it works in the rest of the game. Items clip through walls often too, like rugs that will sit both indoors and outdoors. This messiness gives the game a feeling of being in early access, but it's not.It's oddly restrictive with where some items can go, too. Once I placed some outdoor stone tiles, but when I wanted to move them, I seemingly had no way of doing so. When I unlocked a motorcycle decoration by befriending one of the regulars, I wasn't allowed to place it outside the cafe like I could with some of the flowers.It's not a bug, but it's also worth mentioning that the characters swear sometimes, which seems so wildly out of place for a game like this. There's no voice acting, so this will go over some players' heads much like the tutorials, but it just doesn't fit and leaves a sour taste in my mouth given the out-of-character nature. This really feels like a game that would keep things kid-friendly at all times, but curiously doesn't.Cat Cafe Manager is a perplexing game. Its design is deliberately forgiving, but in some cases to a fault. It looks and sounds joyful, but bugs related to actually building the cafe of your dreams can be frustrating. It's still a game where fans of the genre can have fun with it provided they don't mind--or especially if they prefer--something so directionless, but I find it hampers what could've been a lovely blend of cat-sitting and frappe-serving."
3750,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,5.0,1,"  Although the Harry Potter novels are some of the finest fantasy works around, the famous wizard's foray into other media has been met with uneven success. The movies based on these books don’t contain all the story details, but they have been saved by their fantastic special effects and beautiful art direction. Unfortunately, their video game counterparts have struggled to capture the brilliance of the books. Half-Blood Prince continues right where 2007's disappointing Order of the Phoenix left off. An accurate representation of Hogwarts is the main draw, but simple gameplay and a lack of any coherent storytelling mar the whole experience. For fans of the books, there is a certain joy in tromping around the weathered school grounds and dueling death eaters, but the Half-Blood Prince ultimately feels like a half-finished game.        The story is barely comprehensible if you haven't read the book beforehand. There are a couple of references to the titular Half-Blood Prince whose notes dot Harry's potions book, a trip or two through Dumbledore's memory to see the young Tom Riddle, and a quick peek at Harry's ever-growing suspicion of Draco Malfoy. But you'll have to fit these pieces together yourself because the game doesn't spend any time filling in the details. The cutscenes are not only short and sporadic, but they are also poorly acted and look awful. None of the movie's actors lend their voice talents, so you'll have to make do with sound-alikes who sound little like the real people. The character models are based on the actors but are poor imitations of their real life counterparts. Hermione's long hair hardly moves, Professor McGonagall is cast in perpetual shadow, and Ron is cursed with a laughably small head. Furthermore, the game's plot takes liberties with the source material, putting Harry in preposterous positions that clash wildly with the book.      Order of the Phoenix was the first game in the series to faithfully re-create Hogwarts, letting players explore its many hidden alcoves and winding passageways at their leisure. For people who have not played the previous adventure, it can be a kick to walk around the world's most famous fictional school, navigating the moving staircases and taking shortcuts through the many portraits that line the walls. But if you've already played Phoenix, there's very little new to see in Half-Blood Prince. The environment is nearly identical to the last game's so series veterans will find no new thrill in checking out Harry's school. At least it's easier to find your way to your next objective this time. You can summon Nearly Headless Nick any time you're lost, but you'll still spend way too much time backtracking.      Aside from running all around the school grounds (complete with unnecessary motion blur), you partake in three different wizard-themed activities. Seeing as the Half-Blood Prince has greatly improved Harry's potion-making ability, you'll be spending a lot of time in the potions dungeon, brewing up a number of tasty concoctions. This plays like a magical version of Cooking Mama, placing a number of ingredients in front of you with the recipe lining the side of the screen. You can pour, stir, and heat your mixture with a few flicks and turns from the analog stick, and it is cool to combine the often gross ingredients into something even viler. However, you'll need to make so many potions throughout your quest that you'll wish you could slip one of your classmates a few Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans to prepare them for you. What starts as a simple though entertaining minigame quickly reaches tedium as you go through the same motions over and over again.      Quidditch makes a return after a brief hiatus in Order of the Phoenix, but it's less imaginative and even less fun than making potions. You play as a seeker, Harry's chosen position, and once atop your broomstick, you need only worry about flying through hovering stars in the sky. The controls are extremely simple--use the left stick to make your way through the stars and let Harry worry about the rest. When you zoom through enough of them, you automatically nab the golden snitch and end the match. There is a real disconnect between your midair maneuvering and what's going on in the match below, though. In the books, Harry is constantly forced to avoid angry opponents trying to knock him off his broom and heavy bludgers being thrown his way, but none of those obstacles factor in here. You won't have to pull off any fancy evasive moves, and given that your path is preset, you don't even have to search for the fast-moving snitch. This mode is predictable and bland, never capturing the exhilaration of playing an airborne sport.         Your final task in Half-Blood Prince is dueling, and though it's more fun than anything else in the game, that isn't saying much. These one-on-one battles have you slinging magical spells at your opponent and dodging out of the way to avoid losing your own energy. You control your wand with the analog sticks, so depending on what direction your flick them, you perform one of six different spells. Casting a well-timed protego is satisfying because, if you summon the shield at the perfect moment, you can deflect your opponent's attack right back at their face. However, the battles often boil down to one cheap tactic: Stun your opponent with a powerful spell and then spam your weaker attack. For instance, if you can nail your foe with levicorpus, he or she will float defenselessly in midair, and then you need only flick the right stick frantically to let loose a string of stupify attacks, quickly dropping your opponent's health. Going head-to-head with a friend is more unpredictable, but the lack of depth limits the long-term appeal of this mode.      The Harry Potter video games should complement the other media, providing gleeful interaction to match the excellent story from the books and the visual splendor of the films. But Half-Blood Prince isn't much fun to play once you've gotten a taste of the few simple activities. The game is ultimately a forgettable experience, pushing players through the same three minigames over and over again, without ever capturing the thrill of being a wizard. The story lacks focus and is difficult to follow, giving players only the faintest motivation to continue on before it finally ends on an emotionless, anticlimactic note. The Half-Blood Prince squanders its impressive license; you're better off reading the book again.   "
2697,Shoot Many Robots,8.0,2,"  Indie developer Demiurge Studios cuts right to the point with the title of Shoot Many Robots. Blowing away mechanical hordes of bad guys is what this simple-yet-addictive actioner for Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network is all about, so there is no mystery as to what you get. You may not get anything like originality here, but you do get a lot of robot-shooting action for the $10 asking price, along with such amenities as a huge range of weapons and gear, full co-op support in the campaign, and a great sense of humor.        That's it for the storyline. From there, the gameplay is all about shooting many thousands of robots. The RV serves as a command base where you trick yourself out with various weapons and other gear in the bathroom before hitting up a map by the steering wheel to select a destination. Standard platform carnage ensues. You tromp, stomp, jump, slide, and brawl across well over a dozen levels in the campaign, either solo or with up to three buddies in co-op. Combat plays out from left to right, with you blasting everything that moves with two weapons: a shooter with infinite ammo and a cannon with limited shells. Kills result in leveling up. Dead bots explode into nuts that you collect to buy new weapons and armor. If you kill fast enough, you trigger combos that multiply nut numbers up to five times. Bottles of beer (juice in the oddly alcohol-free PlayStation version of the game, which seems otherwise identical to the Xbox 360 one) are chugged to earn health. Movement is handled with the left stick, while everything else is done with the face and trigger buttons.      Yes, you've seen it all before, but Shoot Many Robots has a certain flair to it. The game has a great sense of humor that isn't confined solely to the hillbilly stuff that could have been abused to beat you over the head with one-liners. Instead, you get a surreal Serious Sam vibe to everything, mostly courtesy of the huge selection of bizarre weapons and gear. Items get progressively more absurd as you go, with Walt soon able to use his nuts to buy automatic weapons like the 110 percent American assault rifle, a blunderbuss, a beer (juice) helmet that lets you hang onto more brewskies (juiceskis?), shiny chaps that increase sliding skill, a Tam o' Shanter hat that boosts damage, and so forth.            "
3713,Super Sky Diving 3D,5.0,1,"  Super Sky Diving plays like the worst levels of Pilotwings 64, only without the (formerly) impressive graphics. In the game, you repeatedly parachute out of a propeller plane over a featureless green landscape. On the way down, you must shift your weight slightly so you can fly through various-colored rings. The action moves at an appallingly slow frame rate and it's not much fun to begin with.        Super Sky Diving is mostly controlled with the navigation pad. Arrows pop up onscreen, prompting you in the directions you need go so that you can reach the airborne rings. Pressing the enter key will cause you to perform a flip and will earn you a few points. When you're getting dangerously close to the ground, it's a good idea to trigger your parachute. You'll now move even more painfully slowly than before. Your goal during the parachute segment of your descent is to angle yourself above a landing pad so that you'll hopefully wind up in its center when you land. You'll have ample time to accomplish this feat, so it's hardly challenging.     When you're finished with a run, your score is recorded. Then it's on to level two, which isn't much different from level one. The difficulty may increase, but the setting stays the same. You can pretty much play Super Sky Diving until you grow too bored to continue, which shouldn't take long. Your score is ultimately recorded, but it's stored locally and can't be uploaded to an online leaderboard. In other words, there's not much here to keep you playing.     Super Sky Diving just doesn't look very good (on the Sony Ericsson S710). The plane and diver models got the most love here, but they're merely passable. The ground only looks decent from about 30,000 feet, and that illusion quickly breaks down as you approach the landing site. The larger problem, though, is that the game runs in single frames per second. During the parachute segment, in particular, you'll feel like you're watching a slide show.        If you like the easy listening ""smooth"" jazz played on most tech-support lines, you'll also be a fan of Super Sky Diving's music. We almost expected to see Kenny G clutching his sax and plummeting next to our diver. Fortunately, this nonsense can be turned off at any time with the touch of a key.      The bottom line is that Super Sky Diving isn't any fun to play. You could choose to dislike the game for a litany of reasons, but its yawn-producing nonaction is probably your best option. Super Sky Diving, despite its name, is not in any way an enhanced version of its sport. Whereas actual sky diving is (presumably) thrilling, this game will slow your heart rate to levels unattainable by even the most skilled yogis.  "
1942,Borderlands 2,7.0,2,"Borderlands 2 is a big game. The PlayStation Vita? Not so big. And yet the sprawling cooperative shooter has arrived intact on the portable platform, delivering long hours of shooting, looting, and butt jokes. Well, almost intact. Game design changes, like knocking the maximum player count down from four to two and changing the enemy death animations, do a good job of cutting corners while preserving the core action. Technical shortcomings, however, leave little doubt that this is the lesser version of Gearbox's great sequel. Dialogue and sound effects frequently sound flat and occasionally disappear, while the frame rate often slows down in combat and makes the chaotic action feel unwieldy.  (This review will focus primarily on the Vita-specific strengths and limitations of Borderlands 2. To read a more in-depth analysis of the game in general, check out our original Borderlands 2 review.)   In any transition from console or PC to the Vita, there is a question of controls. The Vita has fewer button inputs than other platforms, and this often necessitates the use of touchscreens for buttons, often with mixed results. In Borderlands 2, the default control scheme puts some pretty important actions on the front and rear touchpads. Some of my battles got a little more heated due to a sprint or a melee attack not registering on the first tap, but for the most part, I was able to act when I wanted to, and my co-op partners reported no troubles (you can also freely remap the buttons if a particular input is tricky for you). Combat in Borderlands 2 is naturally a bit floaty and loose, largely due to way player movement and enemy behavior are paced. As a result, it can accommodate the small degree of control imprecision added by the touchscreens and be none the worse for it. Likewise, the smaller range of motion of the analog sticks may cause some making the PC/console transition to balk a bit, and indeed, aiming can initially feel ungainly if you're used to the game on other platforms. After you adjust the aim sensitivity and spend some time wandering the wastelands, however, the mercenary satisfactions of long-range headshots and up-close bullet barrages are well within reach. And taking on enemies in Borderlands 2 is very satisfying. Raving psychos that run toward you in serpentine patterns, heavy flamethrower troops that wield bulky shields, speedy lizards that can turn invisible and teleport, lumbering insects that spew corrosive acid, giant attack robots that build other robots, and shotgun-wielding midgets that jump out of lockers are just some of the diverse forces arrayed against you. To combat them, you arm yourself with a standard variety of weapon types made distinctly nonstandard by varying scopes, firing patterns, and elemental effects. Throw in a wide selection of grenades, shields that can damage enemies, and your character's customizable action skill, and you've got a lot of different strategic options. Marshaling these options and bringing gleeful destruction to your enemies is a lot of fun, and the variety of adversaries and environments helps keep combat fresh many hours into the game.     full-on firefights there can be a lot happening onscreen, and here's where the Vita struggles. The frame rate slows down and makes things look choppier, adding a bit more chaos to an already chaotic situation. On another platform, you might feel like you still have a grip on things when the action gets frantic; on the Vita, that grip is a bit more tenuous. In many cases, it's just an added nuisance, but in the worst moments, it's another consideration you must add to your decision-making process. Lining up your sniper shot takes a little more patience, and your berserk shotgun rampages have to be a little more wild; it feels like you need to exaggerate whatever your chosen play style is, or maybe get comfortable with having less control. But this isn't to say that everything spirals out of control when the frame rate suffers; the effect is not nearly that severe. There are a lot of elements that combine to make combat in Borderlands 2 chaotic and satisfying, and while the frame rate adds to the former and not the latter, it doesn't tip the scales. This still feels like proper Borderlands 2 action, complete with all the thrills and challenges that it boasts on PCs and consoles. The cycle of exploring the world, vanquishing enemies (who vanish in a spurt of blood instead of melting or falling down or whatever else they do in the other versions), and collecting loot is still enthralling. This cycle gets even better when you play with a friend, something that is no less true even though you can team up with only one other player on Vita, as opposed to three. You need an online connection, though, because there's no local connection option. You can ask the game to find a match for you, or peruse the available matches in a list, and after a lengthy loading screen, you're in the action seamlessly. Whether someone joins your game or you join someone else's, the frame rate issues are about the same, so it's generally as smooth as playing by yourself. Playing with someone else not only adds the usual camaraderies, it also lets you use complementary abilities and tactics, pits you against tougher enemies, and gives you bigger rewards. It's like playing a souped-up version of the game, and it's great. Of course, you might end up with someone who just constantly asks to trade weapons and leaves when you don't comply; such is the risk of all online play. The built-in Vita mic is also active by default, which could either be a great way to communicate and make a new friend, or an annoyance that you quickly mute. The audio landscape in Borderlands 2 is already quite crowded, given all the sound effects, enemy taunts, character quips, dialogue, and voice-over lines. Many of these effects sound flatter and less rich than they do on consoles and PC, even through headphones, and occasionally dialogue lines or effects drop out and leave a conspicuous silence. The lines dropped tend to be prioritized well, though, so you aren't likely to miss any crucial dialogue. This leaves you free to enjoy the irreverent and relentless humor, which is one of the game's greatest strengths.  Audio and video in Borderlands 2 seem to push the limits of what the Vita can handle, but the system merely strains and does not break (though the game did crash once or twice in my dozen or so hours with it). The Vita version also comes with two of the sizable downloadable mission packs, two extra playable characters, and an assortment of bonus goodies. And you can take advantage of the cross-save capability if you own Borderlands 2 on the PlayStation 3. The result is an impressive package that delivers exciting combat, hilarious dialogue, entertaining quests, and delightful rewards."
3585,The History Channel: Civil War - A Nation Divided,5.0,1,"  There's no question that World War II is the war of choice for developers looking to make a first-person shooter based on real-life events. With no shortage of games based on the Second World War already on the market, including its own Call of Duty series, Activision has gone even further into the past--all the way back to 1861--for inspiration. Despite a somewhat unique setting for a first-person shooter, History Channel: Civil War is a run-of-the-mill affair that isn't likely to please Civil War buffs or, for that matter, anyone else.        History Channel: Civil War follows the events of the American Civil War that pitted the North against the South from 1861 to 1865. There are 12 levels in all, and you'll play as a soldier for both the Union and the Confederacy. You'll fight through five levels for the North and six for the South before fighting one last battle for the Union side in Petersburg. However, you're not likely to care which side you fight for--there's very little story, and no matter what you do, the North wins and the South loses. A brief video explains the events leading up to each scenario before each level, but other than conveying the tremendous loss of life and showing a few interesting black-and-white photos, the videos are uninteresting and consist of nothing more than dry narration about troop movements as you view colored blocks moving around maps.      Outside of having some different weapons, History Channel: Civil War plays a lot like any other first-person shooter based on a real war. Your soldier can carry a number of weapons such as muskets, rifles, revolvers, a saber, and even a knife. You can also use hand grenades, but they cause such small amounts of damage that they're completely worthless. You'll start off each level with an objective, which is shown as a star on your radar. Radar? Yes, radar. You know, the radar that was issued to each soldier in the Civil War. These tasks include planting explosives, smashing a telegraph machine, stealing documents, or simply meeting up with a commanding officer. After completing a task, you're given a few more things to do, and then the screen fades to black--there's rarely any sense of accomplishment after a level.      Not only are the objectives for each level not particularly interesting, the gameplay isn't very exciting, either. You have some guys fighting alongside you, but they're worthless, so you'll mostly be going at it alone. Enemy artificial intelligence is subpar. Soldiers stand around while you shoot them, they're completely oblivious to a gun being pointed at their heads and rush you in an effort to fight, and they almost never try to flank you. On the default setting the game starts off quite easy and you can make it through the first five chapters by running-and-gunning through the enemy. It's when you fight for the Confederacy that things begin to get difficult. This is less due to the CPU employing any sort of advanced tactics and more a result of the game throwing more enemies at you, which in turn makes it more difficult to ignore its numerous flaws.     By far the biggest issue is the weapons--more specifically, how long it takes to reload the guns. While it indeed took a very long time to reload these weapons, this instance of historical accuracy hurts the gameplay. The reloading animations are detailed and seem to be accurate--other than being sped up (but still too slow)--but that doesn't make them good. The first time you encounter other soldiers also out of ammo and race them to see who's going to reload first, it's funny, but after a few dozen such encounters it's much less amusing. Most of the weapons in the game hold only a couple of bullets, so you'll have to reload much more frequently than you do in other first-person shooters. Of course, if you do actually shoot someone, the game might not register the hit. If your target is currently fighting another soldier it's not always possible to shoot them; if they haven't been triggered into action, they might not get hit; and sometimes you can shoot them in the face from three feet away and the game won't register a hit. The sloppy hit detection isn't just limited to shooting, though. Eventually you'll probably get frustrated with your guns and run around and melee-attack guys instead, but the hit detection for melee combat is so poor that it's not a very effective option, either.      Unfortunately, the game is plenty vigilant when it comes to tracking how often your soldier gets shot. The CPU has a nasty habit of shooting you through solid objects and dense cover. Enemy soldiers can even shoot you before they appear onscreen, which results in many, many frustrating deaths. These deaths are made all the more infuriating by the checkpoint system--it doesn't exist. Rather than just sprinkling a few checkpoints through the levels, you're forced to save the game. Because you never know when you're going to get shot by an unseen foe, what ends up happening is that you'll sometimes wind up saving the game literally after every soldier you kill. It's as easy as hitting a button on the PC, but on the PS2 and Xbox 360 you must pause the game, select the save option, pick a spot, and then save. If you forget to save, you're screwed and have to do the entire level over again.      It takes around six hours to make it through the entire campaign, and while it can be mindless fun the first time, there's very little reason to play the game again. There's a small amount of replay value in the Xbox 360 version, which has achievements for beating levels, finding hidden items, and shooting accurately. Since it's so difficult to actually hit a target, many of the accuracy achievements are most easily earned by going back through the levels on the easy setting, shooting your gun once, and then running through the rest of the level with your sword or knife. Being a first-person shooter, Civil War might have had some sort of multiplayer component, but it doesn't even have split-screen multiplayer, much less online play.      History Channel: Civil War isn't a bad-looking game, but its visuals aren't particularly noteworthy, either. Soldiers don't look bad from a distance, but upon closer inspection they look rather silly, and the over-the-top death animations belie the generally serious nature of the game. The battlefields are filled with gunfire and explosions, which will destroy buildings and kick up huge plumes of dirt and smoke. Most of the cooler instances of destruction are scripted, though, and the PS2 version lacks many of them. This version also lacks the smaller touches, such as snow or cotton seeds wafting about certain areas, and it's got an iffy frame rate to boot. The levels, while extremely linear, give the illusion of being large and open to exploration due to the forests that surround them. But the ol' invisible wall rears its head should you stray far from your predestined path. In fact, quite a bit of your combat will take place in the forests, which would be fun if the CPU weren't so adept at shooting you through the trees. The PC and Xbox 360 versions are comparable, but the PC version looks better thanks to a solid frame rate.         Civil War's audio is as uninteresting as the rest of the game. The voice acting is dull, hokey, and irrelevant to the point that you'll probably want to skip ahead anytime there's a cutscene. Guns and cannons sound fine, but there's not a great deal of difference between different gun types. There's very little music in the game, though what is there sounds pretty good.      In the end, it's very difficult to recommend History Channel: Civil War to anyone. Civil War buffs would probably enjoy watching a show about the war more than they would spending time playing this game. The narration and cutscenes that take place before each level seem historically accurate, but anyone with any interest in the Civil War would scoff at the History Channel lending its name to a Civil War game that has you actually jump over explosive barrels that are being rolled down a ramp a la Donkey Kong. Anyone else simply looking for a solid-first person shooter will likely wind up disappointed by the derivative gameplay, lack of multiplayer options, and and the numerous quirks and flaws found throughout the game.

1204,Shantae: Half-Genie Hero,8.0,2,"The Shantae series always had a distinct, engaging tongue-in-cheek quality to them, and that’s on full display here. Shantae herself is a self-aware caricature of 16-bit icons--she’s moody and snarky and giddy in equal measure and the side characters are all fun in their own way. The plot feels a little thrown together at times, quickly establishing characters and story elements with little explanation. Admittedly, depth of story usually isn’t the main element we look for in a classic side-scroller, but the overall story feels a bit weaker here than it did in Shantae's previous outings.In her latest adventure, Shantae is still the Guardian Genie of Scuttle Town, a place that's constantly overrun with comically inept pirates, and regularly falls victim to crazy magical schemes. The town is once more attacked by the self-proclaimed Queen of the Seven Seas, Risky Boots. It seems Ms. Boots is after a set of Shantae’s uncle’s blueprints for a machine that has the power to protect the entire town--or cause immense destruction.The reason this otherwise straightforward story feels disjointed is the relatively non-linear structure of the game. Shantae picks up new abilities by completing numerous mini-missions that pop up around Scuttle Town, and these abilities--usually in the form of transformation dances--enable Shantae to reach new areas within various levels.It quickly becomes clear that these side-quest-like missions are integral to finishing the main story objectives, creating occasional confusion about what you should focus on at any given moment. There’s no map or real way to keep track of multiple ongoing quests, only an NPC who provides general guidance. But even that doesn’t always help. Some active goals simply can’t be completed until you acquire a specific power by completing one of the aforementioned mini-missions, though it's a guessing game to determine which one will give you the specific skill you need.Levels expand beyond the town and into locations like deserts, factories, lush forests, waterfalls, and temples. Each world is chock-full of secrets to find, requiring multiple return trips to discover every last one. This process can get a bit repetitive, especially during the opening hour or two when you’re mostly going back and forth between the same few map areas, but the influx of new abilities helps build momentum over time. Thankfully, a couple quality-of-life options open up later that help expedite the process: you can buy a dance move that allows you to jump straight to the next part of a world, skipping superfluous sections altogether. Once you’ve acquired the target item or ability, you can then instantly warp back to town.Generally, Half-Genie Hero is an accessible game, although you will stumble across a few challenging platforming sections. A big part of the gameplay's appeal comes from Shantae’s eight transformation dances. Turning into a monkey lets her jump much farther and climb walls, while a spider transformation gives her the ability to scurry across ceilings. As an elephant, Shantae can bash breakable blocks, and no item or enemy is safe underwater when she activates her mermaid or crab forms. Of course, Shantae still has her familiar hair-whip attack, and she can use magic to throw fireballs, create lightning, and form special shields.The variety of powers at your disposal is one of Half-Genie Hero's strong suits, allowing for a lot of fun experimentation during combat. Like many classic action-platformers, enemies mindlessly move back and forth and attack on sight, with little apparent AI. Similarly, boss battles are entirely pattern-based, but fighting cartoonishly massive enemies is riotously fun--a giant worm, huge mermaid, airships, and other absurd, screen-filling battles await.So, while some minor structural squabbles hamper Half-Genie Hero's pace, the overall game remains a delightful experience. The move to sharp graphics makes the game feel modern, yet the series' old-school charm lives on in the vibrant colors and expressive character animations. And the soundtrack is surprisingly catchy--with hilariously passionate (if minimal) voice work and a great score. It's easy to get wrapped up in fighting and platforming through Half-Genie Hero, which speaks to the pedigree of the series, and how well it translates to Shantae's latest adventure."
2109,Bravely Default: Flying Fairy,8.0,2," 3D Dot Game Heroes developer Silicon Studio. Things don't start off well, however. Take away the beautiful art style, and the first few hours provide little we've not seen before and little incentive to continue. The story of wholesome hero Tiz Arrior seeking answers to and revenge for the apparently random destruction of his homeland is hardly a new one, and while the near fully voiced handheld RPG demonstrates impressive production values, the ear-splitting pitch of each character's dialogue is excuse enough to abandon dialogue scenes altogether (or at least mute the volume). While Bravely Default may not officially be part of the Final Fantasy family, it's only in name that it's not. Get past those opening sequences, and you're gifted with a game that gets close to rejuvenating a stagnating formula, expanding and altering ideas that have been detrimentally unyielding for too many years. Silicon Studio has been wise in highlighting which areas to refresh, and given that the game so heavily relies on it, it's apt that the battle system should be Bravely Default's greatest asset. A few additions to the turn-based combat keep Bravely Default from ever becoming predictable. Alongside the normal attack, magic, and item commands sit options to ""brave"" and ""default."" Select brave, and you can unleash up to four moves in a single turn, the risk being that if your enemies are still alive after your assault, you must wait for them to execute the same number of turns until you can act again. Conversely, default allows you to forfeit your current turn in exchange for banking an extra move to use later. Each member of your four-person team can brave and default independently of each other, allowing some to stay aggressive with all-or-nothing flurries of four moves at a time, while others take a step back and store moves as a safety net in case of trouble down the line. It can be wise, for example, when you're faced with a formidable enemy, to make sure one character (preferably a healer) stores up moves by defaulting to allow him to restore the entire team to full health if things start getting out of hand. Take away the beautiful art style, and the first few hours provide little we've not seen before and little incentive to continue. It's essential that you master this core dynamic of putting yourself in credit and debt if you harbor any desire whatsoever of making headway once the hand-holding stops. Certain enemies, especially bosses, have been designed to make victory incredibly difficult to achieve without intelligent use of brave/default. In particular, many tougher enemies are in the habit of healing themselves when on the verge of death--the only way to overcome them being to attack multiple times with brave at the right moment. In short: ignore the brave/default system at your peril. If you are finding things too difficult, you have the option of altering the difficulty when, and as often as, you like. Yes, this means you can tone the challenge down for a single battle, only to go back to normal once you've progressed. An adjustable random encounter rate allows further customisation of the difficulty level, letting you do away with nonessential battles altogether or increase them to the point where it feels like you can't take a step without being assaulted. How interested you are in leveling up your characters determines how you approach random battles. A robust and diverse job system broadens combat by bestowing each character with a well-defined set of abilities and stats. With 24 to choose from (although unlocking them all is easier said than done), there are a wide variety of combat styles to experiment with and potentially master. Indeed, a lot of the fun comes from testing out different combinations before you settle on a formula (or two) that you feel best suits a team of four. You're free to swap a character's job as often as you want, so if a particular mix isn't working for a certain boss, there's nothing preventing you from approaching it from a completely different angle until your next attempt. It's to Bravely Default's enormous credit that both the job and brave/default systems work so well in tandem. If you are finding things too difficult, you have the option of altering the difficulty when, and as often as, you like. It's a good thing that the core gameplay is so enticing and engrossing, because the story never manages to rid itself of the tedium and convolution of those opening few hours. While the characters, cliched though they are, give off enough charm to make them entertaining (the pantomime-grade villains are especially amusing), the moment-to-moment plot points lack much in the way of intrigue or surprise. Much of the narrative feels like filler designed to lengthen the game rather than elaborate on the story or provide added insight to events or a character's motivations. A wide variety of well-crafted side missions are available and act as decent distraction, while an equally wide-ranging number of StreetPass integrations are also worthy of your time. In particular, a minigame akin to something you might find on Facebook has you rebuilding Tiz's destroyed village of Norende. This is achieved by clicking on buildable portions of a map screen and assigning workers to start construction--the more workers a construction zone has, the faster it will be built (including when your 3DS is in sleep mode). New workers are acquired with every registered StreetPass, allowing you to build faster and farm the reward items completed structures provide. Less welcome is a sleep point system; each spent point lets you freeze time and launch a free attack. One sleep point is gained for every eight hours your 3DS is in standby mode, or you can part with extra real-world cash and purchase points via a microtransaction. Despite that unwelcome intrusion and the lacklustre storytelling, Bravely Default is one of the finest RPGs Square Enix has been involved with in recent times. While it's a stretch to call its battle mechanics groundbreaking, they certainly represent a welcome level of innovation that has a palpable effect on the way you approach combat and makes Bravely Default a highly entertaining adventure."
1452,Beyond: Two Souls,8.0,2,"Beyond: Two Souls is about the life of Jodie Holmes (performed by Ellen Page), a girl who, since birth, has been tethered to an otherworldly entity named Aidan. Naturally, having a poltergeist as an impulsive companion doesn’t exactly equal an ideal life--especially since Aidan’s presence leaves Jodie open to frequent visits from the malevolent side of the hereafter. But even when she’s not being dragged around by invisible horrors, Jodie still has to contend with Aidan’s mischievous tendencies. And on days when Aidan is calm, there’s just life as a socially awkward girl who sees things that nobody should ever have to see. We follow Jodie over a stretch of 15 years, watching her deal with the world--and the world deal with her--and make decisions that change the course of her life.Beyond feels right at home on PS4. Textures are noticeably upgraded from the PS3 version and lighting improvements galore create an even more stunning cinematic experience. The actual playing of Beyond hasn’t changed significantly in the transition to PS4. For the most part, it’s still a copy-paste job from Heavy Rain. Most of your time is spent wandering through closed environments, looking for the magical prompt that signifies when you can interact with an object or person.In keeping with Quantic Dream's trademark style, action is handled by quick time events in a dynamic fashion, taking full advantage of the DualShock 4's motion-sensing functionality. The PS4 edition of the game does add a few tricky bits, where QTEs use diagonals instead of normal up-down-left-right prompts, but those only pop up in two of the chapters. The timing of the prompts seems stricter, which means that Jodie is liable to take a few more brutal hits when the going gets tough, but the QTEs don’t determine the course of the story so much as they bring the action to life. Yes, you could, in theory, just set the controller down during an action scene and let it play out on its own, but you’d be watching a sequence of Jodie getting the crap kicked out of her ad nauseum. Actively participating in Jodie's struggle is much more gratifying.Through the course of the game, the best moments in each action scene require your input, whether you're jumping between moving vehicles, tossing soldiers into the road, stealing a motorcycle, blowing past a police garrison, or saving people from a burning building. There are even a few scattered sequences of stealth combat, where Jodie tackles hapless bad guys into the dirt.Beyond’s big hook, of course, is the fact that, any time you have full control over Jodie, you can instantly switch to Aidan and roam the world as a phantom, floating through doors, walls, and objects, listening to secret conversations, force-pushing objects around, choking the life out of folks, or even possessing hapless victims. The seams of the gimmick show often. It’s built into the story that Aidan can actively hurt Jodie if he travels too far, but how far exactly seems to be determined by the needs of the scene rather than consistent logic.Beyond feels right at home on PS4. Textures are noticeably upgraded from the PS3 version and lighting improvements galore create an even more stunning cinematic experience.Having said that, the puzzles, obstacles, and story points built around Aidan’s powers are wonderfully plotted. A painful goodbye interrupted by Jodie’s irritating father can be salvaged if you choose to give him a much-deserved goodbye choke. More than once, Aidan will have to rescue Jodie from a sticky situation by possessing one of her enemies, forcing him to kill his friends and then himself. Its seldom that we get to see a story through the eyes of a spirit, and the extent to which its used in Beyond leads to some fascinating conclusions.The chronological version of this story told in the new PS4 version is a marked improvement over the original, where the key points of Jodie’s life were scrambled up and presented as a random series of disparate moments as opposed to a life flashing linearly before her eyes. As a chronological narrative, we get a much better sense of the burden of Jodie’s powers, watching her grow from a curious but sheltered child into a rebellious teenager who longs to live in the real world, and ultimately, into a young woman who finds herself routinely beaten by society.Much of the story's impact can be laid at the feet of Page. Her performance, both vocal and physical, is powerful; it retreats to hollowly call upon the full weight of Jodie’s collective traumas in one scene, using the same trauma to fuel a deep, embittered rage in the next. Willem Dafoe brings a similar gravitas. His side of the script is steeped in exposition, especially toward the end, but there are times when he demonstrates genuine warmth and paternal concern for Jodie--traits we rarely see from Dafoe. The supporting cast varies. Kadeem Hardison, the only other “name” actor in the game, is solid in his role, but elsewhere, actors fail to keep up and weigh down scenes with poor acting that contrasts with Beyond's more capable cast members.Beyond remains an imperfect experience but is still compelling for what it accomplishes.They’re bound to Beyond's schizophrenic script, which flips between sequences of earnest, pensive drama, high-octane action, and well-directed but conceptually goofy supernatural blather. The highs are spectacular: The sequence where Jodie deals with homelessness stands out, and a scene where she reunites with a heavily medicated relative is brutally harrowing. The lows, however, are bewildering in their shallowness: An eye-rolling incident at a bar, a detour into Navajo mythology, and a character’s sudden shift into comic book villainy ultimately disappoint. Occasionally, there are scenes like Jodie’s solo mission to take down an African dictator, which, while delivering a stellar dose of action, feels disconnected from the overarching narrative.Beyond remains a unique experience, even as the tools implemented in its creation have become commonplace. It's filled with concepts that are immediately odd and illogical, but if you accept them on their own terms, they add up to a fascinating if unconventional tale. Beyond remains an imperfect experience but is still compelling for what it accomplishes."
3049,F.E.A.R. 3,8.0,2,"   F.E.A.R. 2's startling conclusion, but returns us to the protagonist of the original F.E.A.R., the genetically designed supersoldier known as Point Man. The events at the end of F.E.A.R. 2 have triggered a paranormal catastrophe of biblical proportions in the city of Fairport, and Point Man is eager to make his way there and help out a former squadmate caught up in the chaos. Point Man's not alone, though. His homicidal brother, Paxton Fettel, is along for the ride. Point Man may have put a bullet in his brother's brain in F.E.A.R., but Fettel isn't about to let a little thing like being dead keep him down. The brothers form an uneasy alliance, but despite the tension between them, the story progresses predictably. There's a pleasant sense of closure that goes with seeing the brothers confront the painful reality of their shared past, but there aren't any surprises or scares that will stay with you once the story has run its course. The visuals also won't work their way into your subconscious. F.E.A.R. 3's graphics are plain and lag behind current standards. As a result, the creepy living rooms, city streets, and food courts you fight your way through aren't quite as creepy as they should be; the environments lack the convincing level of detail to fully pull you in. The sounds are more effective; the loud blasts of gunfire heighten the intensity of firefights, and the ethereal wails that accompany ghostly visions may unsettle you a bit, even if the sight of them doesn't.     Point Man and Paxton Fettel are both playable, but when tackling the campaign alone, you must first play each stage as Point Man to unlock the option to play it as Fettel. Regardless of which character you're playing as, F.E.A.R. 3 is, at its core, a corridor shooter that shuttles you from one small area to another and sees you constantly beset by groups of enemies. Although the core action doesn't evolve much over the course of the game, the firefights remain exciting. The assortment of pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, and other weapons you can employ feel powerful, and the smooth controls make aiming and shooting a pleasure. And your melee attacks, which include a sliding kick that can send enemies flying like rag dolls, make it fun to sometimes forgo the use of guns and charge your enemies.     Most of your time is spent fighting soldiers in the private army of the evil Armacham corporation, and these enemies keep you on your toes by flanking your position, though they also occasionally do dumb things like get stuck while coming down stairs. All of the areas in which shoot-outs take place provide ample opportunities for cover, but a lot of cover is destructible, and it's a thrill to frantically dash from one position to another as your cover is blown to smithereens. F.E.A.R. 3 prevents the shoot-outs from growing tiresome by providing atmospheric periods between firefights. For instance, a few quiet minutes spent making your way through a defiled superstore build up the tension before the bullets start flying. And although Point Man and Paxton are figurative killing machines, the occasional opportunity to take control of a literal killing machine and make things very unpleasant for your adversaries is a lot of fun. At a few points during the campaign, you can commandeer two types of armored power suits. These powerful, lumbering contraptions make the assaults of Armacham soldiers laughable, and shooting helicopters out of the sky from inside one of these machines is a delicious taste of destructive power.       As Point Man, you have an edge in battle courtesy of your unnaturally fast reflexes. These let you trigger slow motion for brief periods, making it much easier to line up that perfect headshot or deal with an overwhelming number of assailants. There's nothing novel about the ability to go into slow motion in shooters anymore, but it's still cool to see the air vibrate in the wake of a speeding bullet that whizzes past your head or to watch as what's left of an enemy explodes in a bloody mess. Paxton lacks his brother's heightened reflexes but makes up for it with other talents. As a specter, he can't pick up guns (though he's still vulnerable to bullets), but he can suspend enemies helplessly in the air and fire deadly blasts of energy from his hand. He can also take possession of soldiers even from significant distances, and it's liberating to zap into the body of an enemy from across the room. A meter drains while you inhabit a body, and if it runs out, you're returned to spectral form. But enemies you kill leave behind psychic energy that you can use to refill your meter and prolong your possession time, encouraging you to take risks and not hide behind cover for too long.       Paxton's abilities are enjoyable to use in single-player, but it's when you tackle the campaign cooperatively that they really shine. The player controlling Paxton can suspend enemies in the air while Point Man pumps bullets into them. Paxton can zoom into the body of a distant enemy to flank a group of foes, and then Point Man can trigger slow motion and attack from the front. The constant opportunity to make a coordinated use of the brothers' complementary powers makes working with a partner a joy and distinguishes this game's cooperative play from that of many shooters in which all players have the same abilities.     F.E.A.R. 3 also has four multiplayer modes for up to four players. Soul King is a competitive mode in which players start in specter form. You take possession of soldiers and collect souls from fallen enemies, and the player with the most souls is declared the victor when time runs out. Players lose half their collected souls when killed, so scores can change suddenly even in the final seconds, which means that even those with a decent lead over their competitors shouldn't get too comfortable. In Soul Survivor, one player is corrupted into a specter at the beginning of the match, and that player sets out to corrupt the others, while the human players work together to survive. Both of these modes offer some quick thrills but aren't likely to keep you coming back for long.   In Contractions, you and your fellow players work together to survive against wave after wave of increasingly powerful enemies. Each map has a stronghold in the center, and between waves, players can either repair damaged barricades on the structure or venture out into the surrounding area to grab crates and return them to the base, providing weapons and ammo for future waves. The necessity of rebuilding and stocking up during the brief time between waves encourages teams to communicate well and devise a strategy for survival, and as the situation grows increasingly dire in later waves, this mode becomes more and more suspenseful. The most unusual of all the multiplayer modes is F***ing Run, in which you must hurry through areas while enemies attack you and a towering wall of death pursues you from behind. The wall moves quickly, leaving you no time to dillydally, and if any one player comes in contact with the wall, the mode comes to an end for all players. As the wall gets closer, the screen goes gray and the controller vibrates wildly, and because the stakes are so high, the prospect of being swallowed up by the wall is one of the most pulse-pounding positions F.E.A.R. 3 places you in.     In the end, F.E.A.R. 3's campaign doesn't quite excel. There are few surprises or standout moments, and those who remember the relentlessly creepy atmosphere and edge-of-your-seat scares of the original F.E.A.R. may lament the fact that this game feels like a military shooter with light horror elements. But although F.E.A.R. 3 won't terrify you or leave you gasping for more, it's a solid shooter that satisfies from start to finish.  "
732,The Occupation,8.0,2,"After finishing it a second time I had a good handle on the major events of this bureaucratic thriller, but it wasn't until I'd played all the way through for a third time--and replayed individual sections several times over--that I felt confident I understood the motivations of the main characters. Even now, I'm contemplating a fourth go in an effort to figure out the smaller details and fathom just how deep the conspiracy goes.The Occupation is a story-driven stealth-adventure game that rewards repeat plays even if it can also, at times, feel hostile to the idea of enabling you to delve into its narrative nooks and crannies. It tells a mature, challenging story that is both overtly political and ambiguous enough to leave plenty to interpretation, while its core stealth mechanics deliver a suitably tense experience.For most of the game you play as an investigative journalist who is reporting on a terrorist attack at the stately campus of a prominent IT company. An immigrant employee of the company has been arrested in connection with the alleged bombing, but you've received a tip-off that not all is quite so simple. There's also the matter of the company's work on a personal data harvesting project that seems worryingly linked to the British government's proposed Union Act, an anti-immigrant and anti-civil liberty bill about to face a crucial vote in parliament. It may well be set in the 1980s, but the issues tackled feel all too relevant today. It's a smart story that's told with a deft, delicate touch.It's essentially a detective story in which you investigate scenes, gather clues, compile evidence, and interrogate eye-witnesses. You have arranged interviews with three key players at the company, and in between your appointments, you are able to explore the offices. The catch: you're on a time limit during each of the three main investigative periods. When that time is up--and it varies between 30 and 60 minutes of real-ish time--your interview starts regardless of how much incriminating information you've managed to obtain, and your line of questioning is limited to what you can actually prove.Navigating the office space is in itself a challenge. These buildings are a maze of corridors, security checks, staff-only areas, ventilation shafts, crawlspaces, and temporary construction sites. Remembering how to get from one room to another when you have to travel to another floor, in and out of restricted areas, stealing an ID card here, shutting off the mains power there, is a stern memory test even once you're familiar with the basic layout. But the environments have a real tactile feel that makes you want to keep exploring them.Complicating matters further, if any staff find you in a restricted area--rifling through their filing cabinets, for example--they'll ask you to leave, and if you persist, call security. Fortunately there are gaps you can exploit, both physical ones like the vent under that desk that leads into the locked room next door and temporal ones like those few minutes you have to log in to someone's computer and read their emails before they return from the bathroom. Little touches, like pausing to close the blinds in an office window before continuing your snooping, go a long way to making you feel like a genuine detective.Sneaking around is your best bet to avoid attracting unwanted attention, particularly from Steve, the company's amiable security guy, who wanders the complex and will usher you out of anywhere you shouldn't be. Sometimes he'll spot you from a distance and come to investigate, giving you time to leave the area or find somewhere to hide while he searches. The stealth is just light enough that you get to feel like you slipped by effortlessly without having to worry too much about memorizing patrol patterns or keeping to the shadows. Sometimes it's a bit silly, though, and requires suspension of disbelief like when you clearly dash into a closet from which the only exit is through a vent, but Steve just goes, ""Huh, I wonder where he went?""On one hilarious occasion, Steve caught me trying to access someone's computer, so I tried ducking under the desk. He sighed, ""I know you're in there,"" as he entered the room, walked over to the desk and crouched down next to me, shining his torch directly in my ever-so-guilty face. I could only laugh as he escorted me outside and gave me my final warning.Piecing together the clues obtained from all your clandestine activities while you match them to your mental map of the facility is extremely satisfying. A crumpled note found in a trashcan might suggest that someone is hiding something, but now that you’ve found a way into their office you realize you don’t have the password to their computer and will have to rethink your approach. Your dossier, which updates whenever you reveal something of significance, suggests your next steps but rarely spells out the solution. When you have multiple lines of investigation on the go it can be taxing to keep them all straight, but it’s also hugely enjoyable to scan your dossier again and try to spot that vital connection you’ve been missing.However, it's highly unlikely that anyone could collect every important clue on their first attempt, meaning your mandatory interviews with the key players will feel frustrating and almost painfully ineffective. There are no do-overs without actually starting a new game--the game autosaves only at the beginning of the investigation period, and you cannot create a manual save. It's frustrating when you run out of time and realize you didn't collect all the clues; on my initial playthrough I had nothing at all to pin on my first interviewee while I failed the second investigation period so badly my interview was canceled entirely. One option is to accept failure and resign yourself to playing through the whole thing a second time.But I'm so glad I did. On my second playthrough I was able to find more clues that proved the company was lying about certain things, and I discovered whole new areas of the offices I hadn't even seen the first time around. Still, I knew there were things I'd missed, things I didn't yet understand.I went back for a third playthrough. I had my handwritten notes from my second playthrough, and made sure I added to them whenever I turned up something new. But, as the minutes ticked away, I knew I wasn't going to find out everything. Time was running out and I still didn't know how to get into that office or how I was going to get that document printed. If I went to the interview without being fully prepared, the game would autosave and I'd have to move on whether I wanted to or not. So I quit out. I restarted a fourth time. Then a fifth.I still haven't cracked that first interview. I've finished the game three times now, played that opening section six times, and seen two different endings based on my choices and performance throughout. Each time through, I am discovering something new, some document that adds to my pool of knowledge or some previously unrevealed connection between two people that casts a new light on their relationship. It makes me feel like a proper detective. But it's an arduous process, replaying the whole section over and over, for what feels like ever-diminishing returns. I can't help but wish there was some sort of time rewind mechanic to alleviate the repetition.Of course, it seems churlish to complain too much about a game I'm enjoying enough to willingly replaying it again and again to explore every facet of its story. The Occupation is the sort of game you'll find yourself thinking about when you're not playing it, that gets under your skin in ways you didn't even realize. I'm going to play it again. Maybe this time I'll completely crack the case."
2024,The Yawhg,6.0,1,"The Yawhg isn't really about the Yawhg, as it turns out. Though the titular calamity is destined to ravage your medieval village in a scant six weeks, it's not half as important as the way that you spend your remaining time. And who could find the hours to make doomsday preparations anyway, when there are demons to be slain, magical potions to be imbibed, and artless lute players in need of some comeuppance?  It takes a village to raise them. There's a communal quality to The Yawhg, not unlike a board game when you get down to brass tacks. Two characters must be fielded at minimum, the tacit implication being that the game is best experienced with a few local friends. The unnamed characters you can choose from are identical in every quality save physical appearance and coloration of attire; it's easy to imagine friends squabbling over them like Monopoly players arguing who gets to be the dog (spoiler alert: I do). The board game similarities only get more prominent as the action unfolds. You move your characters' tokens about their cartoon village, settling upon a fantasy trope of choice and seeing where the cards fall. A breezy sort of strategy takes shape for players keen on maxing out their abilities, who can play with an eye to the simple logistics of the stat bonus handouts and angle for the ""best"" ending. For everyone else, there's always the tavern. Who could find the hours to make doomsday preparations anyway, when there are demons to be slain, magical potions to be imbibed, and artless lute players in need of some comeuppance?   Six weeks pass in a heartbeat. There's something to be said for The Yawhg's spartan writing style, but in a game this short, it's asking a lot for it to weave a meaningful narrative. Despite the doomsday countdown, the stakes feel pretty low. It would take a bleeding heart to be much affected by a sentence or two telling you that you defused a bomb, or that a nameless, faceless character you happened upon once has died. And what about the third or fourth time it happens? Like any good board game, The Yawhg feels geared toward replayability, but you'll find the game's various scenarios repeat themselves too quickly for the liking. "
100,Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3,8.0,2,"Following the explosive popularity of Persona 4 Golden and Persona 5 Royal in the West, many Persona newcomers have longed for a way to easily play their moody predecessor, Persona 3. Thankfully, Atlus has now released Persona 3 Portable on modern consoles, allowing more players than ever before to experience it. As it turns out, this story is one well-worth experiencing, as it is arguably the most profound in the series. While Persona 3 Portable might lack the polish of its successors, it retains the series' signature gameplay, compelling stories, social commentary, and stylish nature Persona fans have come to know and love.Persona 3's story begins with the introduction of the Dark Hour, a period of time that exists just after midnight and cannot be perceived by the average human. During the Dark Hour, a dungeon called Tartarus appears and unleashes shadow monsters that plague the real world by inflicting a condition known as Apathy Syndrome, an illness that causes those who have it to become despondent. Naturally, this is where you come in.In Persona 3, you play a high school student who is recruited to fight alongside a group of exceptional teens to take down these shadow creatures and the mysterious forces behind society's collapse. You do this by using personas: powerful manifestations of the self who possess magical powers and can only be summoned during the Dark Hour. Though this premise is already enticing, the game also has a second component: When you're not fending off fiends in Tartarus, you must carefully manage your time as an everyday high school student striving to ace your final exams, make friends, and perhaps even find love. Both parts of the game have a direct impact on one another, as when you interact with people and raise your social links, you and your persona grow stronger. Conversely, when you explore dungeons, rescue civilians, and unveil the mystery of the Dark Hour, you get to see the consequences for your actions unravel in the real world.Those familiar with the Persona series will feel right at home with Persona 3's turn-based combat system. Once in battle, you are given the ability to control either one or all of your party members as you aim to exploit your enemies' weaknesses and unleash a devastating All-Out Attack. To help expedite the process, one of your companions assists you by analyzing enemies and informing you what spells and attacks will stagger them, and which might accidentally offer them aid. While battles do become fairly routine, the game features several difficulty options for those looking to ramp up intensity as well as a speedy autobattle feature that comes in handy if you're more of the ""brute strength"" type.Exploration is another element of the game that will feel like second nature to Persona fans, though without the same level of polish as later entries, it can feel a bit stale. Crawling through dungeons, while fairly breezy, quickly grows repetitive. It doesn't help that Tartarus' many floors are procedurally-generated, modular and scarcely decorated, and the various side quests you can take on add nothing to them whilst also forcing you to do some major backtracking. Fortunately, you can break up your party and send each of your three teammates to roam around a dungeon floor, expediting exploration.However, Persona 3 Portable's greatest strengths--and weaknesses--lie in its social links and overarching story. The game is filled with a cast of interesting and thoughtful characters, beautifully brought to life with expressive character portraits, fantastic voice acting, and fun animated cutscenes. Furthermore, many of these characters' social links--and the game itself--culminate in some fairly profound moments. Akinari Kamiki's story in particular is incredibly moving and ties into the game's overall themes of life, death, and purpose in a way that makes it required viewing.Another fantastic part of Persona 3 Portable is its optional female protagonist, a feature we've yet to see grace the series since. However, there is a big disparity in quality between the male and female protagonists' social links. The female lead's story is shockingly more narratively satisfying, while the male protagonist's perpetuates some more-than-light sexism. In the male route, every woman your age who possesses a social link is a romance option. If you wish to max out their respective social links for the persona advantages, you have to be in a romantic relationship and sleep with them. There is no way to shut them down or simply be close friends. This causes jealousy between the women, results in a whole lot of shady behavior from the male protagonist and his friends, and also just feels pretty gross.The female lead, however, focuses on creating social links and deeper relationships with her fellow party members. Despite Shinjiro, Akihito, Koromaru, Ryoji, Ken, and Junpei all being major characters who are incredibly pertinent to the game's story, you can only explore their social links when playing the female protagonist. She also possesses the ability to simply be friends with the men if she wishes, allowing her character to max out social links without being involved with six different partners.By comparison, the male protagonist's journey seems incredibly shallow and driven by the idea of romantic conquest more than genuine storytelling. This is made even more frustrating by how much the game pushes you to select a male character, warning the player that he is recommended for newcomers or those who wish to experience the game's original story. Regardless, a second playthrough is practically required to unlock all content and see how every social link plays out, so there is a reason to experience both stories--so long as you're okay with putting in the hours.Though this might sound a lot like modern-day Persona games--and in many ways it is--there are some notable differences between Persona 3 Portable and the series' newer entries. Most notably, Persona 3 Portable plays a lot like a visual novel. While you do have control of your character as you explore dungeons, every other portion of the game requires you to interact with your surroundings using a cursor. This choice was made when the original Persona 3 was ported over to PSP in 2010 to accommodate the system's smaller screen size. Overall, this change is a positive thing, as the maps are sleek and easy to navigate. However, this could be a bit shocking to 3D Persona fans and there admittedly is something lost with the removal of these environments, rudimentary as they might have been.Despite nearly two decades having passed since Persona 3 was first released, the modern-gen port exemplifies how remarkably well it holds up. Its compelling characters, flashy gameplay, replayability, and dark-yet-tender narrative make it just as much fun to play as its modern counterparts--even with its lack of polish and repetitive dungeoneering. Put simply, Persona 3 Portable dazzles, regardless of if it's your introduction to the series or merely the one you're taking for a spin as you await the next entry in the series."
4200,Pinball (1985),4.0,0,"  Nintendo's Pinball was among the first games released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and it certainly shows. Even upon its initial North American release it wasn't an impressive game, though for what it's worth, the version that has made its way onto the Wii's Virtual Console service appears to be pixel-perfect.        Pinball gives you one table that takes up two screens. The top screen has a moving target, a lane filled with dots that give you bonus points, and a little slot-machine section that spins up when you shoot the ball into the proper lane. Hitting the moving target stops the reels and gives you opportunities for bonus points if you can stop the reels properly. The bottom half of the playfield gives you a few bumpers, a set of targets that reveal playing cards that create a block between the two flippers when completed, and a row of eggs that hatch when you hit them. If you can hatch all three eggs at the same time, you'll get blocks that prevent your ball from draining via the outlanes. There's also a hole that drops you into a bonus screen. The bonus screen plays a bit like Breakout. You move Mario, who is holding a paddle, left and right. You have to keep the ball in play and attempt to line up colors on a set of rollover targets to eventually free a woman who's at the top of the screen. And that's basically it. You can play Pinball at a higher difficulty setting, but this doesn't make much of a difference. Also, you can play it with another player.     Visually, this is one of the most basic-looking NES games around. That's certainly due to its age, but it most definitely hasn't aged well. The sound is also pretty bare-bones. About the only nice thing about Pinball is the way it controls. By default, you can use the Wii Remote--the D pad moves the left flipper, and you can use either the 1 button or the 2 button to move the right flipper. But if you have the classic controller, you can use the L and R triggers for the flippers, which feels a bit more natural. Either way, though, the game controls just fine.     Unless you have an extremely soft and nostalgic place in your heart for this dud of a pinball game, it's really not worth its 500-point price tag. Save your money for something more substantial.  "
1981,Batman: Arkham Origins,7.0,2," alive; like too many women in comics, she exists not as an individual with her own value but serves only to fuel the anguish of a male character, and because she is literally being kept frozen, she gives slightly different meaning to the phrase ""woman in a refrigerator."" Still, his anguish over her fate makes Mr. Freeze perhaps Batman's most sympathetic adversary, and by using his origin story as the basis for its narrative (lifting many elements directly from the classic Batman: The Animated Series episode ""Heart of Ice""), Cold, Cold Heart takes on a melancholy mood. You know you have to stop Mr. Freeze, but you come to understand his desperation as Batman learns that the truly coldhearted one is the ruthless industrialist whose actions made Freeze what he is. The Animated Series, that Gotham is a city stylistically trapped in 1920s sensibilities. You also pay a brief visit to a dingy nightclub owned by the Penguin, but it's here, as it nears its conclusion, that Cold, Cold Heart starts to lose the narrative focus that has thus far had you hot on the heels of Freeze and putting together the pieces that explain how he came to be and what it is he's after. After making your way deep into the GothCorp facility, you encounter a wall of ice that you can pass only after collecting the pieces of a drill from the nightclub and a few other spots around the city, at which point you then have to return to the wall of ice in GothCorp. It's a diversion that sacrifices narrative momentum to increase the chapter's duration, and the trade-off isn't worth it. Arkham City. That's the best boss fight in the series thus far, but still, this is such a straightforward copy of it that it prevents Cold, Cold Heart's climax from having an identity of its own. There's no surprise in store, just a repeat of an encounter that you've probably already experienced. But the brawls with thugs throughout Cold, Cold Heart feel just different enough from those in the main game to set them apart, since some criminals are now toting freeze rays whose beams encase you in ice if you're not careful. And for the most part, the DLC's structure has you alternating between brawls, stealth encounters, crime scene analysis, and environmental traversal in a way that keeps the pace moving. It doesn't finish strong, but Cold, Cold Heart is still a satisfying sliver of Arkham storytelling."
2064,Team Fortress 2,8.0,2,"TF2 review, the game has benefited from numerous updates and made the jump to a free-to-play business model. So how well is Team Fortress 2 faring in 2014 among the current crop of competitors for your time and money? The short answer is, it's holding up very well. The core action pits two teams of players against each other in a battle to capture points, move a cart, or steal a briefcase. The objective is always very straightforward; it's the interplay between the nine playable classes that makes things so varied and interesting. The speedy scout, the militant heavy, the diligent engineer, the conniving medic, the pesky sniper, the sneaky spy, the feisty pyro, the explosive soldier, and the even-more-explosive demoman all have unique weapons, attributes, and abilities that complement each other and clash in myriad ways. Encounters can vary widely depending on the match type and the makeup of each team, and this unpredictability is crucial to TF2's long-standing appeal.   When you come out of the gate as a heavy with a medic in tow, you're a formidable offensive force, but if a spy loops around to backstab the medic and you round the corner on a pyro, it can all come undone in a matter of seconds. Snipers can cover expected enemy paths, but rocket-jumping soldiers have a knack for finding alternative routes and raining explosive death from above. You may think you have a comparatively weak scout dead to rights, only to be stunned by a baseball and beaten to death. As you watch your giblets splatter on the ground and see a freeze-frame of your gleeful killer, it's hard not to chuckle at the sheer variety of ways you can meet an untimely demise. And the humorous quips, ridiculous outfits, and histrionic announcer help cultivate this lighthearted tone.  Team Fortress, after all. But though there is much that has remained constant about the core game, there have been some notable changes over the years, as well as regular infusions of new weapons and items. Of the hundreds of things available in the online store, some can be unlocked through play, while others must be purchased with actual money. From small doodads that cost less than a dollar to massive bundles that cost hundreds, there's a wide range of ways to customize your experience. Many of the items offer nothing more than a playful twist on the game's already cheeky cartoon aesthetic. You can buy hats, shirts, shoes, and other cosmetic gear to dress up like a character from Adult Swim or don spooky seasonal garb that you can wear only during Halloween or a full moon. Even if you don't fancy shelling out for any of this stuff, it's fun to see some visual variety as you try to light your opponents on fire. Other weapons have more of an impact, like the ones that give your character a new chargeable and expendable power. The scout can build hype, which turns his usual double jump into a triple, quadruple, or quintuple jump, and the soldier can build rage, which allows him to rally his nearby teammates to do extra damage. Skills like these have more of a meaningful impact on the action, bringing something new to the table that your enemies must contend with. And then there are the totally out-there loadouts, like the one that turns the grenade-launching demoman into an extra from the movie .In addition to the cosmetic options, there are a lot of weapons and items that offer small buffs or subtle tweaks to your attributes. Depending on which healing gun the medic equips, for example, he can imbue himself and his targeted ally with extra damage resistance or enable himself to match the speed of his target. Differences like these don't do much to change the core action, but they do give experienced players substantial room for strategic variation. These options broaden the field of viable strategies, which helps keep combat lively and varied. And fortunately, none of the purchasable weapons or items tip the scales unfairly towards those willing to pay. Buffs and bonuses usually come with caveats, and the weapons that bestow new abilities are usually unlocked for free. For this review, I spent some money on goofy hats and some of the stranger weaponry on offer, like the pyro's flamethrower that actually shoots bubbles and rainbows. It was fun to play with the new gear, but I still found myself switching my loadout between free and paid weapons regularly to adapt to the match situation. The biggest divergence from the game's origins comes in the cooperative mode, Mann vs. Machine. In it, you and a few other human players must prevent hordes of robotic incarnations of TF2's classes from delivering a bomb to your base. The money you earn from destroying robots can be spent on mid-match upgrades to your attributes and weaponry, which can be crucial to success. Even on the easiest level, the robot legions are fierce enough to test the mettle of an unorganized team. This is a mode where carefully planned weapon choices and defensive strategies can mean the difference between succeeding and having to try, try again. You can play this mode for free, but you won't be eligible to earn rare prizes or complete challenges unless you pay a dollar for a Tour of Duty ticket. Though it lacks the frenetic unpredictability of competitive play, the cooperative mode can still provide satisfaction for those dedicated enough to see it through. But competition is the real draw, and the Team Fortress 2 community can certainly be competitive. On some servers, you might be berated for unwitting breaches of etiquette, while on others, you might be welcomed with helpful tips and ubercharges. You can even ask for help on certain servers and be paired up with another player who is willing to give you some tips through chat. The community around TF2 is an intriguing one, not just for their deep knowledge of and passion for the game, but for their creative efforts in designing new weapons, items, and maps that have since become part of the experience. It feels like a community of curators, without whom the game may well have dwindled away and passed into obsolescence years ago. Staying relevant even a year after release is rare for a competitive shooter, and yet, here's Team Fortress 2, still lively after seven years in the business. At times it feels like the same game you could have played back then, and at other times it feels like no one will ever quite nail class-based shooter competition the way TF2 does. The experience has evolved over the years without compromising what made it so great in the first place, so though your free-to-play options may have increased considerably in the past few years, there are few that do it as well as Team Fortress 2."
1882,Dark Souls II,8.0,2," the first DLC an aptly disconnected feel from the main game, there's a sense that Old Iron King is meant as natural extension of Iron Keep. It's as if Brume Tower were the original mine and furnace of Drangleic, and Iron Keep were built as the fancier upgrade. It explains the lack of moving parts in the map's various towers. In a land strewn with large misplaced gears and other clockwork pieces, Brume Tower is both antiquated and charming. It's of little surprise that recovering the towers' keys and switches make up many of this DLC's objectives. These towers, by the way, are impressively intricate and are more involving than Dark Souls II's other vertical areas, like The Pit. Brume Tower feels like a fortification built around its towers as opposed to the other way around. The settings of Crown of the Old Iron King are both fantastical and relatable, but nowhere near practical. Gigantic suits of armor hang inexplicably under elevator platforms, hinting that humans10 times normal size once protected Drangleic. A part of me laughs at the sight of enormous chain link bridges made of actual chains. I nervously get the camera angle just right so I don't fall off and wonder if I'll have to endure combat on these narrowest of bridges. From Software would be cruel enough to subject us to such tribulations. As it turns out, you won't have to fight anyone on these chains, unless you lack foresight and lure an enemy there yourself. At that point, any deaths on the chains are all on you. Explore thoroughly enough and you eventually find Iron Passage. Given its cavernous, yet tight spaces and its deep roster of demons, this optional area is a clear follow-up to the Cave of the Dead from Crown of the Sunken King. These caves would be the most challenging sections of the Lost Crowns trilogy if not for the two helpful phantoms you can summon. This cavernous journey concludes with a duel against a blue variant of the Smelter Demon, further underscoring the uninspired boss designs of these expansions. Same goes for Fume Knight, a mandatory opponent in Brume Tower who dual-wields melee weapons not unlike The Pursuer and Old Dragonslayer. The Terminator mixed with the fireballs in the Final Fantasy series. In Iron Keep, there was an odd ease and simplicity in dipping a group of enemies into a lethal pool of lava by the pull of a switch. Similar conveniences appear in this DLC, provided you're able to spot these situational tricks before you fall victim to these traps yourself. Brume Tower is populated with mutants who carry barrels of explosive and flammable liquid. Their bow-legged movement makes them look scarier than they actually are. Their non-hostile behavior should be your first clue of their usefulness. Much like the windmill puzzle in Dark Souls II, this DLC provides its share of ""Ah-ha!"" moments, which almost always reveal themselves as you continue to explore and take stock of your surroundings. I've grown to be that person who can stand in an old building and envision the ghosts of those who have roamed its halls. It's an achievement when a digital environment can trigger similar meditations, something that the Souls games have pulled off time and time again. From Software is keenly aware of this, as evidenced by a memorable, and more importantly, playable flashback sequence of Dark Souls II. What is noteworthy about Crown of the Old Iron King is how it conveys a deep sense history without the help of a flashback. Its slumbering defenses await your arrival, just as they have for countless heroes before and for those who'll follow in your footsteps. It's these guardians who act as the connective tissue between past and present, formidable as always."
1959,Nutjitsu,4.0,0,"     Pac-Man Championship games. They’re just scenery. You don't even get to enjoy new music when unlocking a new stage, the game thus avoiding another chance to distinguish one level from another. Instead, the same boring song repeats on a loop the entire time you play. The challenge comes not from ambitious, energetic, or interesting foes, but from their swelling numbers in cramped spaces. You can increase or lower the difficulty level between missions. Doing the former produces greater experience point rewards for each victory, but also adds to the work you have to perform. You need to grab five scrolls to complete some missions on the easiest setting, for example, but on the higher settings, that number climbs as high as 25, and you have to avoid a greater number of foxes all the while. Foxes also become more effective, with the poisoned trails lingering longer and dashes occurring more frequently. You're likely to go through your supply of items more quickly, and that's a problem, because those items are expensive. A smoke bomb costs 2,000 acorns, while a pack of three costs 5,500. It's not unusual to activate three or four in a given mission, only to find in the end that you've earned a paltry 3,000 acorns as your reward. Imagine if Pac-Man charged you for each power pellet, and you could use them whenever you like provided you don’t mind spending all of the normal pellets you've hoarded. The solution to that particular problem is obviously to not use items so often, but the foxes are numerous enough that eventually you find yourself herded into a corner unless you put one of your defensive measures to use and effortlessly escape. Besides, the game is structured in a way that encourages you to expend items regularly. Not only do you receive experience points that help you rank up more quickly, but achievements are awarded once you use the most expensive abilities a set number of times. The dynamic resembles grinding sessions in old Japanese role-playing games, except in this case, you don't get to explore a new region or visit an exotic town and talk to gossipy villagers. Your only reward is that you get to grind some more. Everyone eventually reaches the same point after playing long enough. The practiced player merely has to endure slightly less repetition along the way. As motivation goes, that's not terrific. With a proactive and broader range of enemies and more distinct environments, along with a more balanced system that didn't penalize you for playing in the manner that appears to have been intended, Nutjitsu might have offered a simple but enjoyable time. Instead, it has settled for a tedious stroll from Rank 1 through 25, rather than the engaging romp that was called for. Nuts to that!"
718,Operencia: The Stolen Sun,8.0,2,"In English, most fairy tales lead with the phrase ""once upon a time."" In Hungarian, they begin with the word ""Operencia,"" which roughly translates to ""far, far away."" And that's exactly where Operencia: The Stolen Sun transports you--to a realm steeped in magic and mystery, wonderfully detached from all things real.Operencia is a dungeon-crawler RPG set in a fantasy world. It begins by plunging you into the salivating jaws of a three-headed dragon. However, as soon as you slay the colossal serpent, the prologue ends. Before you know it you're no longer a dragonslayer, but a runaway farmhand determined to follow their dreams. Those mad powers you had ten seconds ago? Gone. You'll have to make your own destiny if you're to retrieve the mythical land's stolen sun.Composed of 13 different levels, the world of Operencia boasts some breathtaking vistas. You explore a variety of locations, from the murky depths of a castle cursed by tears to the metal wilds of The Copper Forest--which is infested with copper soldiers sporting chainsaw-like utensils for hands. The diversity of the game's art makes for a journey that is at all times fresh, awe-inspiring, and wonder-inducing. Its bright colors and intricate art style create an aesthetic that complements the mystique imbued in its magic, and it boasts a score that screams tales of monsters and creepy crawlies told around the warm hearth of a dirty tavern. This envelops you in a world of imagination and fantasy, more concerned with evoking a sense of wonder than any sort of fantasy realism.After you embark on your journey across this fantastical realm, you slowly begin to come across a whole host of intriguing companions. These characters all speak in pre-written conversations, leaving you no option to intervene with your own dialogue. However, conversations between characters are so well-written that it doesn't really matter. The banter between companions while resting at bonfires--which replenishes your health and energy--is no less arresting. Every companion you come across is their own person and has their own sense of humor--the witty Joska hurls jests at everyone in the party, whereas the strong-willed Kela ensures that you don't falter on your quest. I enjoyed sitting back and drinking in the conversation more so than I experienced a longing to interject with my own thoughts. This world is so wonderfully weird that it's better for telling you its stories, rather than affording you the chance to write your own one within it.Combat in Operencia is fast-paced, fluid, and engaging. It revolves around turn-based mechanics, involving a mix of physical, ranged, and magic attacks. The magic attacks utilize a strength/weakness system based on elemental typing such as frost, lightning, and fire. Your build can either lean heavily into one fighting style, or encompass all of them in order to gain versatility at the expense of specialization. While maxing out a single stat allows you to deal devastating damage in some cases, immunities can render you completely ineffective if you've overcommitted to one particular attribute. I played as a mage, as I usually do in fantasy RPGs, but without my Strength-based companions I would have been Ancient Elemental bait before I could say abracadabra. After battles, you'll gain experience and loot. For every level you gain, you'll get three ability points to pump into attributes. Leveling up feels well-rewarded, and the game allows you to carve out a combat niche for yourself with its myriad permutations of attribute/ability point combos.Managing the ability cooldowns and energy point costs of each individual character in your four-person team can be tough, especially in the late-game when a mistake can mean death, or game over if you're playing with permadeath enabled. As a result, it's important to play smart. Even the strongest of enemies can be quickly incapacitated if you're willing to exploit their weaknesses and be savvy with your potions.Operencia's combat takes customary turn-based RPG mechanics and makes them feel fresh with its own pacing and style. The only thing it could use is a little bit more versatility, as at times it feels as if your own character is a bit vanilla compared to the more advanced predetermined builds boasted by late-game companions. At the same time, you have seven characters to build a team of four from, so you can always change things up if frost spam is starting to get a little watery. As for enemies, there is a whole range of different beasties of all shapes and sizes who would love to eat you for dinner. Some of their niches can be very annoying, but not in a way that seems unfair.Traversal in Operencia is tile-based, creating opportunities for intriguing environmental puzzles. However, at times this system complicates attempts to look at the finer details of the world's beauty. There were moments where I wanted to look at objects caught between tiles or move an inch closer to the horizon in order to take the perfect screenshot, but I couldn't because the traversal system got in the way.Operencia: The Stolen Sun transports you to a realm steeped in magic and mystery, wonderfully detached from all things realMost of Operencia's puzzles are excellently designed. In one case, you have to defeat four powerful enemies, all of whom drop a token. These tokens are then placed in slots around a magic circle; you need to place each one in the right position, and then spin the circle's three tiers to match animals with the tokens' likeness. This might seem like the kind of puzzle you'd come across in similar RPGs, but Operencia's aesthetic really makes the solution feel special. Before you know it, a surge of color and light encapsulates the circle and magical powers begin to work in wonderful and mysterious ways.The puzzles that aren't solved by environmental manipulation or visual prompts usually require you to use creative key items, which range from magic shovels to griffin feathers. These feathers can be attached to any object with a feather marked on it, and cause that object to become drastically lighter. This allows you to uproot trees and move heavy weights with the flick of a wrist. You even get magic beans to grow beanstalks with! The puzzles get progressively harder as you make your way through the game, but are almost always intuitive and fair.Some don't fit this formula, though. While optional puzzles used to unlock secrets and legendary items are understandably best fitted with esoteric solutions, ones that are tied to story progression shouldn't be as niche as they are. On one occasion, I spent almost an hour and a half looking for one of four keys, all of which were used to unlock a series of doors that led to the mould for yet another key. While the first of these was an easy find, the second one was randomly hidden far away from the cave and could only be found by using the magic shovel in a certain area. This made me decide to scour the whole map looking for hidden doors and buried treasure, of which I found neither.As it turns out, the third key is actually obtained by returning to a melting pot I used to acquire a different key. There are so many keys. When I solved the puzzle I felt annoyed, not relieved. And I still had one more to get. Lo and behold, the fourth key was right in front of the last door, requiring no puzzles or exploration. After such arbitrary solutions to the previous puzzles, this was subversive. It was also incredibly irritating. I couldn't stay annoyed for long though, as the joyous booming of your relieved companions is infectious, and the game picks up so quickly that you're bounding onward into the next dungeon before you can get sufficiently annoyed to stop playing.Operencia tells a wonderful story derived from Central European folklore, mythology, and history, and it does so with unwavering confidence in its makeup. Companion characters are funny, and the banter between them makes for a fun experience that's not without its heartfelt moments. In terms of combat, the strategizing is so engaging that you'll likely end up charging rat warriors headfirst instead of hopelessly attempting to avoid bumping into them. Best of all, though, this world is so stunning that you'll just look at the trees, the water, the rocks--everything. It’s a shame that some of the puzzle solutions are needlessly frustrating and present significant obstacles in getting through the story, but aside from that Operencia provides a truly special experience.Operencia transports you somewhere far, far away, and once you get there, you'll probably want to stay a while."
3779,Disney/Pixar Up,5.0,1,"  In the Pixar film Up, elderly yet energetic Carl Fredricksen sets off on what he thinks is a solitary adventure but finds himself accompanied by a wide-eyed wilderness explorer named Russell. Their relationship becomes the core of the film and, as it turns out, of the game too. Throughout Up, Carl and Russell must work together to overcome obstacles as they traverse the jungles of South America. There’s a cooperative dynamic and a simplicity to the gameplay that make Up feel as though it were designed to be played by a parent and his or her young child. Indeed, parents looking for an easy game that encourages cooperation will find that Up fits that bill. Unfortunately, they'll also find that Up is just too simple and repetitive to be worthwhile.        The bulk of Up consists of very basic platforming and puzzle-solving. Carl and Russell, who spend most of their time humorously tethered to Carl's offscreen floating house, plod across the terrain, frequently needing to work together to advance. Carl can hoist himself up on ledges using his cane and then help Russell up, while Russell can shimmy across narrow ridges and pull Carl up using a rope. Carl and Russell will also often have to work together to push heavy rocks or get across wide gaps by using naturally occurring fulcrums to send Russell flying to the other side. Parents will appreciate that the game eliminates any potential frustration by constantly nudging players in the right direction with vocal clues about what to do next and big icons that indicate where Carl or Russell should stand to help the other along. As a single player, you can switch between the characters with the press of a button, and your AI-controlled partner will generally do a fine job of tagging along and staying out of your way. Still, cooperation between the characters is such a crucial part of the game that it's much better to play with a partner.      The only thing that breaks up the walking, jumping, and rock pushing is the occasional bit of what might be loosely described as combat, though it's too simple and repetitive to be engaging. You'll sometimes be attacked by wasps that can be driven off by the high-pitched whine of Carl's hearing aid or incapacitated by Russell's virtuoso bugle playing. You'll also be ambushed by dogs from time to time that you must defeat by blocking when they leap at you. These attacks quickly grow tedious and occur with exasperating frequency in the later levels. There are also a few boss battles against large jungle creatures, though these are all just a straightforward matter of finding something in the environment to use against the creatures and repeatedly exploiting it. Should Carl and Russell run out of energy at any point, there's no real penalty. They're just sent back to the most recent checkpoint, which is never very far behind.       The simplicity of the action is tolerable at first because it feels as if it may be preparing you for more complex platforming and puzzle-solving to come. However, it soon becomes clear that the game doesn't introduce any significant new gameplay elements over time and that it's largely the very same stuff in the very same environments repeatedly throughout the four hours or so it takes to complete the game. Having Russell hoist Carl up his rope is a lot less interesting when you're doing it for the 20th time. Even the eventual appearance of Dug, the endearingly eager-to-please talking dog, isn't enough to alleviate the crushing simplicity and monotony of the action. When you finally find yourself in the luxurious dirigible, the Spirit of Adventure, you'll be ready to scream at the sight of one more inch of jungle. As a result, even the young kids for whom the game is clearly designed may get bored of this adventure long before it's over.     The adventure is bookended by two aerial dogfighting levels, which, like the rest of the game, are simple enough for young children to grasp and can also be played by one or two players. There's also a local split-screen multiplayer mode for up to four players. The three game modes on offer let players try to shoot each other down, race to shoot balloons from the sky, or team up to try to take down the opposing team's huge dirigible. The accessibility and relatively fast pace of the aerial combat makes it perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of the game, though it, too, lacks the variety and depth needed to give it any longevity.        On the Wii, the graphics evoke the visual style of the film, but they lack the richness of detail to bring it to life. This visual simplicity, along with the sameness of most of the levels, makes Up tiresome to look at after awhile. It falls to the voice acting, then, to enliven the game, and this is the one area where Up shines. The principal cast members of the film reprise their roles here, and their performances have all the enthusiasm of their work for the movie. It helps, too, that they're given some humorous dialogue that was written and recorded specifically for the game. Fans of the film will enjoy the chance to spend more time with these characters; it's just too bad the gameplay makes that prospect so tedious. And even the dialogue eventually loses its charm through overuse because the same vocal hints are constantly repeated. Voice acting aside, the sound presentation makes good use of the film's whimsical score, and the sound effects are passable.     There's something novel and charming about a game that has a crotchety old man as the protagonist, and Up does a fine job of capturing the delightful characters from the film. Still, considerable as it is, this charm can only carry Up so far; thus, the tedium and simplicity of the gameplay make enjoying Up very difficult. This is unabashedly a game for the younger set, and parents may appreciate a game that won't frustrate their children while encouraging cooperation to boot. But even young kids will likely get tired of this long walk through the jungles of South America.  "
2365,Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate,7.0,2,"                     Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate isn't an entirely new game. Players who sank hundreds of hours into Tri are going to find the majority of the content familiar, but given the nature of Monster Hunter, this isn't necessarily a problem. You make progress fast, so tackling the same beasts you already fought in the same locations a few years ago isn't really a deterrent. As a stand-alone game, Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate pales in comparison to its console counterpart. It's still worth getting if you don't own a Wii U and absolutely can't wait for a new handheld Monster Hunter (the 3DS-exclusive Monster Hunter 4, with online play, is due out later this year), but the drawbacks make this version harder to recommend.  "
1221,Orwell,8.0,2,"The Orwell program has an “Ethical Codex” that requires each piece of intelligence found to go through a two-step process. Data you find can be sent on to an “adviser” who does not have access to the same systems you do, cannot have a conversation with you, and must judge evidence impartially. This system means that you need to really pay attention to what data you’re sending through and what you’re choosing to ignore.As you peruse the evidence available to you, certain pieces of text will be highlighted in either blue or yellow, corresponding to suspects in the case. The blue-highlighted text can immediately be uploaded to Orwell, but it can be misconstrued. Send through an innocent joke between friends about one torturing the other, and without the proper context, the adviser is likely to think the person is unhinged. Yellow-highlighted text denotes a contradiction with another piece of text, and it’s up to you to study these contradictions and figure out which piece of information to send through. Not being able to go back on your poor choices feels like a gameplay constraint rather than something that makes sense in the narrative, but being forced to commit to your questionable choices ramps up the game’s tension as you search for details.Orwell simulates the busywork of an office job to tell a larger story about surveillance. You soon find yourself investigating “Thought,” a mysterious collective made up mostly of young activists with awkward Internet histories. As a game focused on searching through in-game websites for dirt and details, Orwell lives or dies on the strength of its plot and characterization. Thankfully, the writing is consistently lively and intriguing. The depiction of a surveillance state feels extremely relevant; it’s made clear that the obvious advantages of being able to easily track terror suspects online come with a disquieting loss of privacy for innocent civilians. In an age where so much personal information is willingly released by so many, Orwell brilliantly explores the implications of this data being misinterpreted.The characters feel real and familiar, without ever drifting into cliche. Investigating their lives and relationships means getting to know them and figuring out which characters are actually committed to the ideals they claim to hold. You never meet any of these people, but the characterization runs deep. Suspects like Harrison, an angry idealist with an attitude problem, an inflated sense of self-worth, and a clear willingness to sell-out on his ideals, feel genuine. The game’s writers have a strong grasp of how people communicate online and how rhetoric shifts between personal and public conversations. It’s also interesting how personal bias can seep into the gameplay--I often found that whether I wanted to hide or release certain information depended on how much I liked the person I was investigating.The changes brought about by your decisions and discoveries are significant, and while they won’t upend the entire plot, there were noticeable differences in my second playthrough. Subsequent runs are unlikely to be as satisfying as the first, though, if only because solving the central “mysteries” of Orwell signposts which decisions are likely to be “good” or “bad” on a second attempt. I found myself needing to purposely reach conclusions that I knew were incorrect, role-playing as a bad investigator just to see what would happen. But even knowing the “right” answers isn’t always enough--I tried hard to change an outcome at the end of Chapter 3 on my second playthrough, but the thing I’d been trying to avoid still happened, albeit for completely different reasons than I’d experienced on my first playthrough. Orwell’s twists and turns are surprising and exciting, even when you have some idea of what’s coming. There are a few minor issues with Orwell’s current build--the game hard crashed on me a few times, or refused to load images--but each issue I had was fixed with a reload, and because the game saves constantly, I never lost progress.Orwell is a hard experience to pull back from, even as the dirtiness of your job sinks in. It uses simple mechanics to tell a complex and engaging story, one that feels particularly relevant right now. This is a game where your choices matter and resonate, and which will leave you with plenty to think about once it’s over."
4387,Boogie,4.0,0,"  Boogie was EA's first game built from the ground up for the Wii. It wasn't very good on the Wii and now it's on the PlayStation 2 where, once again, it's not good. The game's premise, which has you sing, dance, and even create your own music videos is an interesting one. However, an interesting premise does not necessarily make for a great game. Such is the case with Boogie. Now that motion controls are out of the picture, dancing is even less interesting than before, the karaoke still doesn't work very well, and the tracklist isn't likely to appeal to the younger audience the game is geared toward.        There are five playable characters in Boogie, each with five playable chapters and a nonsensical storyline. While the characters may look interesting, their stories certainly aren't, thanks in no small part to the cutscenes, which aren't animated and have no voice acting. Some chapters will have you sing, but most of them are dance only. If for whatever reason you don't want to sing, you can play without a microphone and the karaoke chapters will have you dancing instead. Other than earning credits to unlock a few songs and some new clothing accessories, there's no point in playing the story mode. Once you've unlocked the songs, you can choose to either sing or dance to them from the main menu. With the game's music video feature, you can record a singing or dancing performance, as well as spice it up with camera cuts and a limited number of effects. The editing tools are simple and easy to use, but you can still get some nice results with minimal effort.     Boogie starts off with a tutorial that gives you the basics on getting down. You move your character around the level with the right analog stick. All you have to do to dance is tap the square, circle, or X button in time to the music. What happens onscreen loosely correlates to the movement of the left analog stick, so if you move it down, your character will usually do a move that involves crouching or spinning on the floor. If you press to the right, your character will perform a move to the right of the screen. You'll want to avoid repeating the same moves too many times in a row because if you do, your score will go down. But this isn't much of a problem because you can string together combos with ease by performing consecutive moves on the beat. There's also a visual indicator on the screen to help you stay in time to the music. The more moves you time properly in a row, the higher your score, and as your score increases, so does your boost meter. Once you've obtained a bit of boost, you can hold down the L1 button to trigger a series of arrows at the bottom of the screen. If you follow the pattern correctly with both analog sticks at the same time, your character will perform a special dance move that will net you big points. The boost meter will also let you perform poses. All you've got to do to strike a pose is hold down the R1 button and move the left analog stick to line up the onscreen cursor with the target.     That long explanation can be boiled down to this: Tap some buttons, flick the analog stick around, and you'll win. On the Wii, it was possible to have at least a little bit of fun if you got out of your chair and really danced while you moved the controller, but that doesn't work here. Even on the hardest difficulty setting, the game is absurdly easy and requires minimal skill or rhythm. There's a party mode where you can have a dance-off with a friend, but the addition of freezing and reversing icons doesn't do much to make it any better than the single-player game.     Dancing is only half of Boogie's gameplay because you'll also get to show off your pipes in karaoke mode. It's quite similar to the Karaoke Revolution and Singstar games. The lyrics run across the bottom of the screen and the pitch is represented by horizontal bars. A cursor shows the pitch of your voice relative to the actual song, and all you have to do is hit the right notes to earn points. Actually, that's not true at all because the karaoke part of the game is essentially broken. Like other karaoke games, you don't have to sing the proper words--that's nothing new. What is new, however, is that you don't even have to sing. You can whistle bird calls, tap the microphone, blow into it, rub it on your shirt--anything you can think of--and still pass. Basically, if you're alive and breathing, the game thinks you're the next Frank Sinatra.     Nearly every song in Boogie could be considered a karaoke staple. But it's an odd, mostly older mix of songs for a game that's seemingly geared toward the younger crowd. Only a handful of songs, such as ""Fergalicious,"" ""SOS (Rescue Me),"" ""Let's Get it Started,"" ""Don't Cha,"" a few Britney Spears songs, and a couple of other tunes are from the past 10 years. The rest of the songs are much older, and there's an emphasis on '70s hits, such as ""ABC,"" ""Brick House,"" Celebration,"" ""Le Freak,"" or ""Love Rollercoaster."" All of the songs sound like they're covers and slightly remixed (and censored) versions of the original, so if you're looking for the real songs, you'll want to look elsewhere. Many of the songs sound like they've been shortened a bit, which is understandable if parts with no singing are cut out. But some songs, such as ""Dancing Machine,"" still have extended sections with nothing to do. You can use the controller to dance while you sing, but you're not awarded any points for it, so there's little point.        At least Boogie is a nice-looking game, though it's not as nice-looking on the PS2 as it was on the Wii thanks to the omission of progressive scan and the addition of some washed-out colors. The character designs are well done and fit the personality of each character. Individual dance moves are animated nicely, but they don't always flow well from one move to the next, and it would be nice if there were more variety. The levels aren't particularly original, but their settings go along with the story, while their bright colors and cartoonlike style fit right in with the rest of the game.     Boogie managed to hide some of its flaws on the Wii because the singing and dancing could be fun if you really got into it. Because there are no motion controls on the PlayStation 2, there's nowhere for the game's lousy controls and bevy of other flaws to hide. Thus, most people will likely see Boogie as a missed opportunity. It's far too easy, the tracklist isn't very good, karaoke is straight-up busted, and the dancing just isn't much fun. That's not what people are looking for when they spend $50 on a game.  "
1787,LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham,7.0,2,"    The Dark Knight Returns, and also the gray and blue leotard of his 1966 television debut. Excellent vocal work, provided by such seasoned veterans as Troy Baker (Batman) and Clancy Brown (Lex Luthor), breathes life into every character, fleshing out their distinctive personalities. Crashing this party is a peculiar selection of celebrity guests, one of whom you'll find swiftly overstays his welcome. This is none other than Conan O'Brien, who acts as a dedicated tour guide in the Batcave and Watchtower, both of which exist as enormous hubs where you can select missions or look at collected trophies. You'll find him throughout the hubs explaining the function of particular rooms. The problem, though, is that O'Brien repeats his spiel every time you enter one of these areas. After listening to him explain for the umpteenth time what a map room is, I was ready to pull my hair out. Superhero fan and occasional Batman comic writer Kevin Smith also makes an appearance, but has thankfully fewer lines than O’Brien. Adam West's inclusion makes the most sense out of the bunch, and you will find him in just about every level playing the role of a TV personality in distress. Though his audio level is through the roof and his pleas for help easily drown out everything else. Lego Batman 3 is a massive game featuring tons of extra content, but not all of it is worth exploring. The lengthy campaign comes in at around 12 hours, but your time may differ depending on how many side quests you choose to pursue. The game is brimming with secrets and hidden collectibles, so much so that it can be overwhelming. Even after putting in around 20 hours completing the story and hunting down gold bricks and completing some extra missions, I’d still barely scratched the surface. In addition, you also have miniature versions of the home worlds of Lantern Corps members. While it is initially rather neat to fly around the small planets, they don't offer much beyond even more items to collect and dull races to complete. All in all, they’re not much more than boring distractions. Batman: The Animated Series, and of course books like The Dark Knight Returns and Batman: In Darkest Knight, among many others. The resulting game is somewhat perplexing, often verging on baffling. To be fair, this is not nearly enough to greatly harm what is overall a genuinely fun game, but it does mean that it lacks some sense of direction and balance. Resogun-inspired shooter sections, as well as levels where you stomp through shrunken versions of famous cities. Many of the headlining characters are superb, with the Flash coming in as an easy favorite. His constant hijinks during cutscenes left me laughing out loud every time. Just as great is the portrayal of Cyborg, who left a broad smile on my face every time he unleashed his trademark ""BOOYAH!"" In short, the game is a delightful, family-friendly hop around the galaxy starring some your favorite superheroes. A wealth of hidden secrets in every level keeps the game high on replayability, while the deluge of extra content promises many hours of adventuring."
3920,Frogger Advance: The Great Quest,5.0,1,"Frogger, a cultural icon almost synonymous with the golden age of arcade gaming, has now branched out to just about every console imaginable. Frogger Advance: The Great Quest for the Game Boy Advance is the latest addition to the family. Yet gamers expecting an updated look at the classic game will probably find themselves a little confused by this game, as it bears virtually no resemblance whatsoever to the game that made ""Frogger"" a household name. In practice, the game has more in common with the Donkey Kong Country series than anything else.  This 2D side-scrolling platformer is clearly aimed at a young audience--it features bright, colorful graphics, a control scheme that is easy to pick up, and a cast of characters that would be right at home on any Saturday morning cartoon. Unfortunately, in addition to this, the game offers very little challenge, even for younger gamers. At the same time, however, it manages to be entertaining just because of its lighthearted theme.    If you are a fan of this type of game, or looking for a good game for a younger gamer with a GBA, Frogger Advance is a solid choice, although it does end rather quickly. Those looking for the Frogger they grew up with should probably look somewhere else. "
1911,Portal,9.0,2," is you, and that you are looking at yourself in profile. Stepping through the oval, you find yourself in the hallway outside of the relaxation vault, looking in at where you stood just a moment ago. You've just had your first taste of portals, and it's only going to get weirder from here on out.     quite anywhere. Certain surfaces are not portal-able, and this is one way that subsequent levels, known as test chambers, become more difficult. Other elements, such as energy balls, weighted cubes, floor switches, and moving platforms, are incorporated into the test chambers in increasingly exacting ways, but the real complexity and the real genius of Portal lie in the challenge of ""thinking in portals.""    here is the floor 20 feet below you and there is a spot high up on the wall? You'll retain your momentum while going through the portal, so entering the floor portal at speed will rocket you out of the wall portal perpendicular to the floor. This has a profound impact on your strategy, but not all portal-thinking is strategic. If you place one portal at your feet and the other on the ceiling overheard, will you fall forever? Or if you put two portals on the floor side by side, could you create a reasonable facsimile of whack-a-mole? The magic of Portal is that it truly does inspire this unique flavor of spatial imagination, and once you get a taste, you'll be delighted to find yourself thinking in portals even when you're not in front of your PC.      If portal technology is the meat of the game, then GLaDOS is the perfectly paired wine. The omnipresent voice that guides you through the test chambers, GLaDOS initially reveals a dry, almost unintentional sense of humor in the first few test chambers. As you progress, her humor begins to show signs of self-awareness, eventually blossoming into something too hilarious and too well-deployed to spoil here. Suffice it to say, it is one of the chief pleasures of Portal and features some of the best writing in video game history.          For all its heady delights, Portal is a short-lived feast and can be reasonably completed in as little as five hours. To help draw things out a bit, Valve has included six advanced chambers, all of which are existing test chambers tweaked to present a tougher challenge. You can also take on challenge maps and attempt to complete the test chambers with the least number of portals, the least steps, or in the least time. Ever since it was originally released more than six months ago, there has been ample time for the online community to produce a bevy of maps that, though varying in quality, are freely available for any test-chamber-hungry portaler to download. Its Orange Box roots mean that Portal also comes equipped with in-game achievements that can serve to extend its longevity. Nevertheless, the odds are that it'll be over a bit too quickly for your liking.     Short as it may be, Portal is a fantastic game that should be played by anyone interested in unique, well-crafted gameplay and a witty, whip-smart script. The stand-alone retail release comes with the same price point as the downloadable Steam release, which is about the cost of a night out at the movies. Portal may not last much longer than some feature films, but pound for pound it remains one of the best games on store shelves.    "
2220,GRID 2,8.0,2,"sensible, this opening race is a perfect example of what makes Grid 2 such a blast. This is a game that takes every opportunity to remove the barriers between you and the thrill of all-out street racing. With an exciting career mode and handling that strikes a great balance between arcade and simulation, it succeeds brilliantly at that task.       Whether you're drifting through the hills of rural Japan or careening along California's Pacific Coast Highway, Grid 2 gives you the tools to perform some truly spectacular automotive feats. This is all thanks to a driving model that borrows equally from the forgiving handling of an arcade racer and the demanding physics of a driving simulator. Cars are nimble and highly responsive, but there's a very real relationship between your tires and the surface beneath them. You can give up only so much traction before a drift sends you spinning into a barricade, while accelerating too quickly out of a corner can spell disaster if you've forgotten that you're in a rear-wheel drive. There's this delicate balance between the flashy and the grounded, but it's a balance that Grid 2 pulls off extremely well.      It's only fitting that with such an empowering driving model, Grid 2 treats you as an ambassador to the sport rather than a no-name up-and-comer. You're the poster child of the newly formed World Series of Racing, an organization designed to bring together drivers from all corners of the globe. Your job is to win over these international stars and convince them to join the cause. You do this by traveling the world and competing against everything from muscle cars in Miami to hot hatches in Barcelona to luxury sedans in Dubai. You'll even find yourself driving in supercars on real-world circuits, whether it's the historic Indianapolis Motor Speedway or the relatively new Algarve Circuit in Portugal. All the while you're earning new fans to bolster the WSR, a sort of currency that propels you from one event to the next.     Grid 2 features no shortage of spectacular locations, and every one of them looks gorgeous. From the golden sunset above the construction cranes of Dubai to the glittering lights of nighttime Paris, these environments feature an exceptional attention to detail. The varied selection of cars looks just as great, no matter if they're in pristine condition at the start of the race or shedding metalwork left and right via the game's frighteningly convincing damage system. The whole presentation is simply top-notch, right on down to the immersive soundscape of roaring engines and squealing tires. The frame rate occasionally drops during vicious collisions, but for the most part, Grid 2 is a smooth and technically impressive racing experience.        There's a lot more to Grid 2 than its impressive presentation. This is a robust package with a lengthy and exciting career mode. You're constantly being introduced to new driving disciplines and event types. There are standard offerings such as elimination and time attack, as well as more specialized events such as drifting contests and touge, an automotive ballet where two cars race through narrow mountain roads and any collisions lead to an immediate disqualification.       But the most fun can be found in an event type called live routes. Normally urban locales like Miami and Dubai are divided into six or so predefined tracks, each taking you on a tour through different areas of the city. What live routes do is generate a dynamic layout that stitches together sections from every single one of those six tracks. It's an event where you never know what's around the next bend, which keeps you on your toes as you maintain an exacting focus on each randomly selected turn.        The focus of Grid 2's career mode is very much about getting you on the road and having you experience one crazy race after the other. This is not a game that wants you to spend too much time in the garage. Instead of buying cars and upgrading engine parts, you're simply awarded a choice of vehicles after milestone events. As your garage expands, you develop a collection of grippy all-wheel drives like the Audi RS5, demanding track cars like the KTM X-Bow R, and all manner of other makes and models. With such a varied selection of cars and event types, there's a deeply satisfying sense of challenge in learning the nuances of each vehicle and deciding which one is best suited for a particular event. Rarely does the most powerful car win by default; Grid 2 demands a familiarity with your garage and is all the more rewarding for it.     Even with its forgiving handling, Grid 2 can get quite challenging--especially toward the latter stages of the career mode. There's no driving line to guide you through each corner, and full vehicle damage is enabled by default, meaning your car starts to pull and sputter if it has taken too many hits. As the game ramps up in difficulty, you may find yourself wishing for optional driving assists, which are sadly lacking here--your only option is to raise or lower the difficulty level. Fortunately, Grid 2's fleet of vehicles are such a blast to maneuver that you'll be more than up to the task. Add in the ability to rewind time after a nasty accident, and what you get is a game that challenges you but rarely leaves you frustrated.      As engrossing as Grid 2's career mode is, it's just as easy to get sucked into the multiplayer side of things. Besides giving you the opportunity to race all those same tracks and event types in a competitive online environment, Grid 2's multiplayer serves as a nice counterpart to the career mode by allowing you to get a little more hands-on with your collection of cars. Racing online earns you cash to buy new vehicles, which you can tune by upgrading the engine, drivetrain, and handling. And while you're keeping tabs on your garage, the game is keeping tabs on you by tracking your driving style and ensuring that you're matched up with drivers who race just as clean or dirty as you. The multiplayer is a terrific addition to an already excellent game, and the ability to play local split-screen is just icing on the cake.        Whether you're competing online or off, Grid 2 offers a fantastic blend of arcade and simulation racing. This is a game that wants you to experience the thrill of breakneck street racing, and gives you all the tools necessary to do just that. With terrific handling, gorgeous environments, and a broad selection of event types, Grid 2 slams on the gas and rarely slows down.   "
1356,DOOM,8.0,2,"But the new Doom is louder and faster than the old model. Its battles ask more of you, and its heavy-metal soundtrack causes your body to quiver from turbulent surges of adrenaline. From the outset two things are made immediately clear: you were born to kill demons, and you'll do anything it takes. You will wrench countless jaws from their joints and eviscerate the swollen flesh of your enemies between bouts of furious gunfire. These powerful moments carry what, at its core, is a simple game. The cadence of Doom's campaign is unwavering to the point of predictability as you make multiple round-trips between Mars and the depths of hell. Each location bears its own distinct but static identity, and your return trips inspire more deja vu than surprise as you tread familiar ground on either side of the dimensional portal you're charged with dismantling.You rarely take an unexpected turn, but any bothersome feelings this gives you are washed away the moment you enter battle. Doom equips you with a range of weapons that start simple and grow ever more elaborate. Not all are created equal, and there are some you will ignore for their lack of stopping power, but many are formidable, and a near constant stream of upgrades allows you to tweak your favorites in order to give them greater functionality and strength--more cause for attachment to, and wonder in, the power at your fingertips.This power extends to Glory Kills, Doom's contextual dismemberment techniques that can be triggered when you cause an enemy to stagger. They are the embodiment of gore fetishization, offering multiple ways to tear enemies into pieces, dependant on your angle of approach. Glory Kills are also strategically valuable. Enemies occasionally drop health items and ammo when felled by a gun, but you're guaranteed an injection of health when you flay your opponents using your bare hands--and occasionally with a body part of their own. This incentivizes you to rush in even when on the brink, offering hope at the end of a potentially deadly tunnel. Similarly, you also collect a chainsaw that can rip demons in half as a one-hit kill, which causes ammo to spout from their corpses. Your chainsaw requires precious fuel and should be used sparingly, and figuring out the best time to use it becomes a tense mind game of its own.The rhythm of combat--which almost always begins as a plainly presented lockdown in a room--grows increasingly hard and fast over the course of Doom's thirteen missions. Larger and more dangerous demons appear over time, and in greater numbers. As you weave and leap around maze-like arenas to improve your vantage and search for much-needed supplies, you function like a magnet, drawing enemies toward you. As you do, the once-disparate groups in an arena become concentrated. The effect of this is that you can put your explosive munitions to good use and inflict heaps of damage to multiple enemies at once. But there is a downside: you can quickly back yourself into a corner as you retreat. Despite this danger, herding enemies is par for the course in Doom as it's often the most viable tactic. This plays into the cyclical murderous bliss of Doom: round and round we go.The tension of facing increasingly durable enemies gives this system longevity despite its repetitiveness. Bipedal imps give way to towering, bloated monstrosities, powerful stampeding beasts, and disembodied flaming skulls. To keep up with the horde, you must use resources earned for your past feats to modify and upgrade your weapons with new capabilities. This steadily feeds into your brash and violent persona in order to maintain the high of combat in the face of your growing tolerance for all things brutal. Where a shotgun blast to the face was once satisfying and effective enough, you ultimately desire the thrill and power of unleashing a mortar-like cluster bomb from your double-barrelled best friend. When he's spent, you'll be thankful you upgraded your heavy assault rifle with micro-missiles that pierce the air with a subtle whistle before lodging under the skin of a demon and exploding, one after another.Where a shotgun blast to the face was once satisfying and effective enough, you ultimately desire the thrill and power of unleashing a mortar-like cluster bomb from your double-barrelled best friend.Upgrades can be earned by sweeping maps of demons, or discovered by exploring every inch of Doom's environments. Both techniques demand diligence. Secrets and hidden areas aren't new to Doom, but the variety of rewards you can reap are greater than ever. Every bit of hardware, including weapons, armor, and their underlying software, can be augmented in multiple ways. Nevertheless, you come across your fair share of upgrades even if you stay on the beaten path, and you'll probably want to as the thrill of combat gets under your skin. The process of awkwardly platforming your way across Doom's maps grows increasingly tiresome as your pulse drops to a murmur, and your patience for anything other than combat wears thin. The advent of Rune Challenges mixes this up a bit, offering self-contained tasks that momentarily take you out of missions and into tiny arenas where you need to defeat enemies under strict conditions. As enjoyable as these can be, they don't hold a candle to mission combat and eventually become an afterthought as you seek your next battle.When Doom funnels you from one location to the next, it introduces brief moments that tell your story, and the story of the energy-obsessed Union Aerospace Corporation. It's the UAC's ill-conceived decision to tap into Hell's energy resources that created the portal between dimensions in the first place, and though you are an agent of the UAC in a way, yours is a reluctant enlistment. The tale of your involvement carries a certain gravitas in the way it speaks of legends and dark messiahs, but it ultimately amounts to little more than window dressing to justify your actions.When your journey comes to a close, you will have spent close to a dozen hours in the thick of it, the last of which are punctuated with riveting boss fights and seemingly impossible odds. With a flush arsenal and enhanced physical abilities, you may opt to return to previous missions and find items you may have missed, or lay waste at higher difficulty levels, but multiplayer awaits those who seek something new. Apart from a few multiplayer-exclusive weapons and the ability to play as demons during portions of a match, there's actually very little new about Doom's multiplayer. Its modes are few, delivering the expected assortment of match types, including team deathmatch and domination challenges, and a couple fun diversions like freeze tag. By and large, you won't find much in multiplayer that hasn't been done before, but what's there is enjoyable in small doses thanks to the fast pace of combat and the explosive nature of Doom's weaponry.Doom is straightforward and simple, but it serves its purpose: to thrust you into increasingly dire scenarios fueled by rage and the spirit of heavy metal.More impressive than multiplayer is Snap Map, a mode that allows you to create and share both multi- and single-player maps online. Tutorials walk you through the steps involved in creating a map, which is intuitive to begin with. Beyond ease-of-use, Snap Map will live or die through the creativeness of the community, which has already made a strong showing, delivering a range of maps that range from brutal to absurdly entertaining. More than multiplayer, Snap Map is the cherry on top of the new Doom.But without a doubt, the loud and chaotic campaign is Doom's strongest component. It's straightforward and simple, but it serves its purpose: to thrust you into increasingly dire scenarios fueled by rage and the spirit of heavy metal. Many shooters chase the thrill Doom delivers, but few are as potent in their execution. It captures the essence of what made the classic Doom games touchstones of their day, and translates it to suit modern palates with impressively rendered hellscapes and a steady influx of tantalizing upgrades. Doom is the product of a tradition as old as shooters, and while it's not the model to follow in every case, modern shooters could learn a thing or two from Doom's honed and unadulterated identity."
669,Super Mario Maker 2,8.0,2,"Mario is a video game icon not only because he's a plucky and affable dude, but because he's the face behind some of the best platformers of all time. Nintendo has carefully guided his adventures for decades, but something happened in 2015: It gave players the keys to design and share stages in Wii U's Super Mario Maker, and the Mario we thought we knew took on a whole new light. He was no longer a laidback high-jumping hero; Mario became a hardened speed demon, a death-defying daredevil forced into unruly gauntlets crafted by evil geniuses who know his every hop, skip, and jump like the back of their hand.With the Wii U and 3DS versions of Mario Maker abandoned by Nintendo at this point, Super Mario Maker 2 on Switch brings us back to that heady time from years past. The game itself is largely familiar, though the more you play and create, the more you notice all of the little additions tucked inside and appreciate how they elevate the potential for creativity in new ways. Mario Maker 2 is a robust level creation tool and a fantastic open-ended platformer that will no doubt spur a new era of competition among players and creators alike. But so far, it's amazing what the right players can do when given the tools to craft Mario's world.The big exception is the newly included set based on Super Mario 3D World, which can only be used in isolation. Lest you mistake the ""3D"" aspect to suggest you're breaking free from side-scrolling Mario, you aren't--you're just given access to unique elements from that game, such as the never-not-strange Cat Mario power-up. Far from being the only notable addition, the sum total of which are too numerous to list here, the Cat Mario suit is up there with the ability to make slopes, craft custom scrolling for stages, and set level-clear conditions as one of the most impactful additions to the Mario Maker formula. But of course, even the smallest variable can have a huge ripple effect in the hands of the right person. Time will tell what seemingly average element gets twisted into a diabolical weapon in the hands of the craftiest creators.For new creators, there's the chance of becoming overwhelmed with the number of options available at the start, but that's where Yamamura's Dojo comes in. Yamamura is a pigeon, but a very wise and insightful pigeon at that. If you need help wrapping your head around the basic concepts that go into conceiving and creating a level, Yamamura's your bird. His catalog of 45 lessons (divided into Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced sets) walk you through everything from laying tracts of land and placing Goombas to the more philosophical side of level creation, even navigating the meta side of being a creator unleashing their work for others to judge.These lessons will help get a novice creator up to speed, and the fact that there's nothing holding back knowledgeable designers from the start was a smart move by Nintendo, too. The pool of creators has thus far made some truly impressive stages that utilize Mario Maker 2's robust toolset well. The overall level of logic inherent to a Mario game remains largely the same--no digging under the hood to rewrite traditional cause-and-effect rules, for example--but the spirit of Mario Maker 2 comes alive when familiar elements are combined by masterful players, often in ways that Nintendo would never employ in a traditional Mario game.So far, that unexpected creativity often manifests itself in oddball stages packed with an unreasonable number of enemies, diabolical platforming tests that demand superhuman reflexes, or clever contraptions that move Mario and key items around an environment with calculated chain reactions. Not every stage is a winner, but because the fundamental controls and elements of the world are tried-and-true, it's rare that you run into a custom stage worth getting upset about. Ultimately, dozens (soon to be hundreds, if not thousands) of alternative stages are seconds away, a convenience that's easy to take for granted. It's not an understatement to say that the speed at which you can browse, download, and play levels are key factors that make exploring Mario Maker 2 so easy and enjoyable.Discoverability plays a part in what levels you find, and beyond basic lists such as popular, new, and trending courses, there's a detailed search function that lets you narrow stage selection by attributes like theme and difficulty. You can also sort by tags that indicate the type of stage at hand, be it an auto-scrolling level or puzzle-centric challenge. After playing, you can leave feedback on the level for other players to consider--a simple but meaningful chance to contribute to the community and learn from your peers. This is all to say that Mario Maker 2's online stage selection is both organized and catered to the wider player base. You don't have to involve yourself in every aspect of it if you just want to play a bunch of random Mario levels, but it's great to see that you can become deeply involved with your fellow makers if you desire.One of the hotly contested elements pre-launch was online multiplayer, which comes in both co-op and competitive forms. Nintendo's initial plans to limit these modes to random matchmaking drew the ire of some fans who quite reasonably expected to be able to play with their friends. Nintendo has since made it clear that feature will come, just not in time for launch. As it stands, the lag present in most multiplayer sessions (where matchmaking happens automatically) ruins the experience. Mario, and especially Mario Maker levels, are geared around precision platforming. When you can't rely on the movement of your character or your controller inputs, you might as well not be playing at all. If anything stains Super Mario Maker 2, it's the current state of online multiplayer.On a more positive note, the other major addition to Mario Maker 2 is a proper story mode, a campaign of 100 Nintendo-made levels. The story is typical Mario fare set in an overworld with NPCs and a few fun surprises, taking things a few steps further than The Super Mario Challenge from the 3DS Mario Maker. It's not an amazing addition in light of the countless levels coming from other players, but it's an enjoyable alternative if you prefer a more coordinated campaign. There's the slight missed opportunity to give you creative tools as a means of solving purpose-built puzzles, to give you that hands-on learning in a practical scenario, but they are given to you as options to overcome stages that you repeatedly fail. It's not as if there's a drought of custom stages online, even before release, though Nintendo's batch of stages are nice to have if you want to dig into stages handmade by the developers themselves."
3211,de Blob 2,8.0,2,"     De Blob 2 for the DS tells a different story from the console game of the same name. A mad scientist named Dr. Von Blot has been conducting experiments at his secret research facility. His work has been fruitless until Blob stumbles on his lair and inadvertently provides the doctor with the material he needs to turn himself into a nasty ink mutant called Blot. Accompanied by a spunky robot named Pinky, Blob pursues Blot to rescue a kidnapped friend and protect the citizens of Chroma City from this new threat. It's a simple tale, told through a series of amusing animated sequences between levels and some funny text exchanges (""Prof has never been without his industrial strength moustache straightener for this long!"") that pop up during gameplay.            "
2045,Dustforce,7.0,2," in my original review, Dustforce has a strict economy of movement. Running and jumping are easy enough, but there are restrictions on how many times you can dash or jump again while in midair. It's a bit confusing at first, but the game provides a comprehensive tutorial that quickly brings you up to speed on how to maneuver through this world. The simplicity of Dustforce's early stages also helps ease you into your new role as ninja custodian before the game quickly ramps up the difficulty. After you finish a stage, the game judges you on completion (did you sweep up all the garbage?) and finesse (did you sweep up all the garbage < stylishly?), as well as noting your time. Each stage has its own leaderboard where you can compare your best time against others. You can also watch runs from other players through the leaderboard, which is an especially useful way for improving your own times on the more difficult stages. PlayStation 3 players can also record their favorite runs for later review, a feature that is missing in the Vita version. Completing stages rewards you with gold and silver keys that unlock more advanced stages, and those behind the gold doors are no joke. Spikes, bottomless pits, and numerous enemies test every ounce of your platforming skill. Dustforce involves equal parts planning and execution, and feels at times like you're playing a puzzle game. The developers have an optimal path laid out for you in each stage. All you have to do is find the path, and walk it. It's an enjoyable challenge, and successfully mastering a stage is very satisfying. inMomentum and Mirror's Edge, and that definitely holds true in this new version. The score is complemented by a soft pastel color palette that is easy on the eyes and doesn't distract you with too much visual noise. Both elements work in harmony to keep you focused on the task at hand. The simplicity of Dustforce's early stages also helps ease you into your new role as ninja custodian before the game quickly ramps up the difficulty. Multiplayer in this new version of Dustforce remains the game's weakest feature. Both modes--Survival and King of the Hill--put the focus on player-versus-player combat rather than terrain navigation, the game's strong suit. Both modes also lack any sort of matchmaking function, and after each match ends, you are immediately booted back to the main menu without the option of a rematch, which means re-creating your lobby all over again. Ultimately, the online multiplayer feels like a negligible addition to the game. Multiplayer aside, Dustforce remains a delightful platformer that is both soothing and stressful. The game's pleasant world invites you in and puts you at ease, before shoving you off a cliff and into a bed of spikes. Or into a bottomless pit. Or sometimes a bottomless, spike-lined pit. The difficulty curve is smooth, but when it hits its apex, the challenge within is brutally satisfying."
4466,Shadow Tower,4.0,0,"Shadow Tower is From Software's fourth attempt in the first-person action-RPG genre, following the King's Field trilogy (only two of which were released in North America). For those who don't know the King's Field series, it was a relatively popular first-generation, first-person action-RPG in Japan. You roamed dungeons, fought monsters using different weapons and magic, gain experience, and leveled up. The controls took a little getting used to, plus the game ran at 15 frames per second, causing frustration among some gamers. The game also didn't give you much direction; you had to piece everything together yourself. Shadow Tower is pretty similar, save for a few exceptions.The story takes place on the continent of Eclipse, where the holy land of Zepter lies. In this land is a sealed tower guarded by the kings of surrounding nations, keeping to traditions passed down from their ancestors. A long time ago a tragedy descended upon the kingdom of Eclipse. There was a crown with a single eye, and its terrible gaze snuffed out the kingdom in one night, leaving nothing but a gargantuan hole. That single-eyed crown that once glowed so ominously is now closed and quietly sealed within a tower. Ages have passed, and darkness has once again consumed the peaceful land. You will take the role of Ruus Hardy and go into the darkness to fight against evil creatures and monsters in search of the crown with the single eye.Shadow Tower introduces new features and changes from King's Field. Pressing different combinations of buttons on your PlayStation controller lets you switch weapons, shields, and magic from your primary to secondary and vice versa. This is very helpful, because one thing that's a real nuisance about this game is that accessing the menu screen requires loading (a Now Loading screen even pops up!). The game also eliminates the element of gaining experience and leveling up. Instead, it is replaced with soul points (SP), which can be used to enhance physical and magical attributes, such as hit points (HP) and magic points (MP). SPs are gained by defeating monsters or through special items.The game has also brought along a few elements from the game Diablo, mostly in its use of inventory. Weapons and armor deteriorate as you use them and will eventually break without repair. You can spend your HP to repair worn-out or broken items. This brings a lack of balance to the gameplay because you have a limited number of potions to regain HP. You can only find HP potions in dungeons, by killing monsters, or by trading in items. Surviving the different layers of dungeons is one thing, but trying to keep your HP and weapons at their best is something that can't be done easily. Also, you rarely earn money from killing monsters, so you are limited as to what you can buy in stores. The polygonal models of creatures and monsters show that the graphics have certainly improved over King's Field, but the frame rate still remains an issue. Although 15 frames per second in King's Field seemed bad at that time, looking at Shadow Tower in 20 frames per second still just doesn't cut it in these days of 30-60fps games. Even the pilot demo of King's Field II (which was only available a few years ago at the Tokyo Game Show in Japan) ran at 30 frames per second. So the technology is there, just not implemented. It's too bad.The dark, gloomy overture that plays across the main title might get you excited about the game's soundtrack, but the game only contains heavy footsteps and growling, and no music whatsoever. One can respect the developers' attempt to keep the dark mood and atmosphere by not putting any music in the game, but it just isn't effective. Sure, there are certain parts where you are startled at the sudden appearances of evil creatures from dead corpses, but the absence of music is still disappointing. In place of a soundtrack are character voice-overs. But while many of the game's characters speak, the voice acting is totally lifeless. You come across a shop and pause. There is silence, and then the store clerk speaks, ""I don't care if you're human, as long as you're a customer."" And then silence again. Very boring stuff.There are other features in the game where you can try to fill an encyclopedia with a complete list of all the creatures in the game. You can also collect rare weapons and armor and place them as bets in a two-player arena mode, but this will likely only attract hard-core players of the game.  Shadow Tower is a blend of King's Field and more actioney RPGs like Diablo - a mix that only ends up bringing frustration rather than a sense of adventure. The game was released over a year ago in Japan, and it shows; it looks extremely outdated when compared with current PlayStation games. If you are a hard-core fan of the King's Field series, you may want to give this one a try. But others will just be wasting their time."
3925,Ford Racing,5.0,1,"Sifting through the video game retailer bargain bin can at times unearth a hidden jewel or two. Ford Racing, from Empire Interactive isn't quite that elusive diamond in the rough, but it is certainly a decent game at the $9.99 suggested retail price. As the name suggests, Ford Racing lets you compete in progressively difficult racing seasons with access to virtually the entire line of Ford automobiles. Everything from the Fiesta, Taurus, F-150, and Explorer to the Mustang and the GT90 racing model are in the game. Despite strong control mechanics and an advanced physics engine, the game has many flaws keeping it from being a truly appealing product. However, fans of Ford's line of small cars, family sedans, SUVs and trucks, and sports coupes may find some novelty value in Ford Racing at its bargain price. At the game's onset, you are given three choices: quick-race, career, and head-to-head modes. In most other racing games, the quick-race option gives you quick access to several of the nicer car models and tracks--not Ford Racing. Only the dull and slow-moving car models are available out of the box. Most of the faster Ford automobiles and the cool tracks need to be unlocked in the career mode first. The head-to-head races present a similar scenario--it's hard to find any form of excitement when racing your friend's Escort against your Fiesta. So, naturally the meat of the gameplay is in the career mode. The career mode is made up of several racing seasons, each featuring a specific model from Ford's line of vehicles and each progressively more difficult. You must compete in several races that take place within variations of the five major courses, and you must earn points based on the position of finish--very much like the NASCAR Winston Cup series--in order to advance to the next level. It takes a slightly masochistic player to endure the entry-level models and family sedans before you're allowed to take the wheel of relatively more fun and performance-oriented models such as the Mustang and the GT90 racecar. The first several seasons, using such vehicles as the Ka, Fiesta, Escort, and Puma, can almost feel like a chore, as you are forced to drive with and against those low-powered vehicles. The only real saving grace in these early races is the game's tight controls and realistic physics engine. Ford Racing does a nice job of melding realistic handling and physics with responsive controls. Taking an Explorer or F-150 through hairpins feels like it should in real life, with massive amounts of body roll and deliberate acceleration coming out of the turn. In similar fashion, relatively nimble models like the Mustang and Escort are more forgiving, allowing more room to make and subsequently correct steering mistakes. The game's lone race-aspirated model, the Ford GT90, exhibits realistic torque-steer and launch characteristics. In general, Ford Racing presents forgiving, arcade-style controls complemented by realistic physics that result in a nice gameplay balance. Other categories aside, the handling and controls should appeal to most racing fans. However, all is not well in the gameplay department. The AI is overly simplistic. The computer-controlled drivers follow preset racing lines, regardless of situation. If for some reason you find yourself in their racing line--this happens frequently--the AI driver will simply push you out of the way, often pushing you off the track altogether. Simply stated, the gameplay in Ford Racing becomes about mastering the intuitively designed tracks rather than competing against the other drivers in the race. The graphics in Ford Racing follow the same routine as the gameplay setting in the career mode: You'll have to suffer through truly appalling environmental graphics in the early courses, before you get to see some nice eye candy in and around the latter tracks. Impressive textures on stone sidewalls and subtle details such as tire barriers shine in a few of the latter courses. However, these are few and far between, as most of the game is bland visually, with sparse 3D environments superimposed over ugly 2D backdrops. The cars are modeled well enough so that they are easily recognizable, but the textures, such as paint and decals, blend together to create a tortuous mess. The music in Ford Racing is typical racing game fare, and to a discerning ear it may sound a bit like the soundtrack in the original Gran Turismo. Low-profile drumbeats hum quietly in the background and are usually ignored or turned off altogether. However, it never gets to the point where the music is poor enough to detract from the overall gameplay experience. Ford Racing exhibits impressive handling and control characteristics, and it can be fun to drive the game's twisty tracks. However, the poor AI and the limitations presented by the sole Ford license in particular keep it from being a truly entertaining game overall. But as mentioned in the opening, if you're into Ford's line of family sedans and sports coupes, you may find Ford Racing an appealing buy, particularly at its low retail price."
224,POSTAL 4: No Regerts,1.0,0,"The Steam page for open-world first-person shooter Postal 4: No Regerts markets it as, ""The long-awaited true sequel to what's been fondly dubbed as 'The Worst Game Ever,' Postal 2!"" If developer Running With Scissors' goal was to live up to this legacy and maybe even outdo itself, then it succeeded with aplomb. Postal 4 is an abysmal video game. It's mind-numbingly dull, its combat is unenjoyable and lifeless, its humor is unfunny, and it's plagued by myriad technical issues, glitches, and crashes. This is a series that gained traction by courting controversy at a time when pearl-clutching over video game violence was world news. Postal 4 can't even claim to be problematic, as its bloodshed is notably tame by today's standards, and any jokes that might be considered offensive are too focused on lazy stereotypes to be considered noteworthy.Postal 4's basic setup sees the Postal Dude return along with his loyal canine companion, Champ. After taking a pitstop and forgetting to lock their car, the pair's vehicle, trailer home, and all of their earthly possessions are stolen, leaving them stranded at the side of the road with nowhere to call home. Fortunately, the fictional town of Edensin, Arizona is located just over the horizon, so the unlikely duo head there in search of employment and their stolen items.Much like previous games in the series, you're given a different set of errands to complete each day, from Monday through Friday. These are mostly menial tasks like changing lightbulbs in the sewer, convincing people to sign a petition, and taking on the mantle of a prison guard for the day. Others are slightly more unusual, including one errand that tasks you with launching disillusioned Americans over the Mexican border using a makeshift catapult. The one thing all of these objectives share in common--and I can't stress this is enough--is that they aren't fun to engage with in any way, shape, or form. This is probably intentional in some cases, but to what end? Postal 4 doesn't offer a satirical critique of capitalism or anything like that; the game is just designed around dull busywork that proves more effective than any sleeping pills. Eventually, these odd jobs add more and more firefights, whether you're getting involved in shootouts with border patrol agents or an anti-bidet cult.Combat would add a tinge of excitement if it weren't irredeemably bad. Enemy AI is the main culprit hindering Postal 4's first-person shooting, but it's far from the only one. Your foes have a tendency to run toward you in a straight line and suddenly forget you exist, or clump together in a group, motionless, waiting to be killed. The Postal Dude's arsenal consists of a familiar assortment of pistols, shotguns, and rifles, none of which feel satisfying to use outside of the revolver--because it lets you dispatch multiple enemies at once like Overwatch's Cole Cassidy. All of the weapon types lack the punch and sense of impact you would expect, which is partly due to the flaccid sound design, and aiming down sights feels overly clunky and stiff in a way not many shooters do. The boomerang machete and pigeon mine are the only weapons that veer away from your bog-standard firearms. The former lets you chop off limbs by chucking a machete that comes back to you, while the latter unleashes a swarm of pigeons that will rip apart any nearby foes in a feathery fury. The Fournicator sounds like it might be outlandish but it's essentially just a shotgun with four barrels.Aside from being dumb and outright broken at times, the AI also soaks up bullets, making most of the weapons feel decidedly weak. Guns like the M16 alleviate this somewhat, but finding ammunition is nigh-on impossible unless the enemies you're fighting are using the same weapon themselves. You can purchase ammo at vending machines located around Edensin, but the game doesn't make finding them easy. The in-game map is awful, being both cumbersome to navigate and lacking in any relevant information. The vending machines aren't located on the map; in fact, the only icons that do exist are for shops that often serve no function outside of being set dressing. It's also rare that you'll ever find yourself drowning in cash, so purchasing just a small amount of ammo will empty your pockets in a hurry.As a result of all this, I spent most of the game using pistols instead of anything more powerful, and each handgun's tepidness is only exacerbated by Postal 4's habit of artificially inflating the difficulty by throwing dozens of enemies at you at once. Dying is inconsequential because you don't lose any progress and can simply run back to where you were after respawning, but slowly killing all of the game's braindead enemies is still a monotonous chore.Outside of running errands and shooting people, you'll spend the rest of your time traversing the town of Edensin. The map is large enough that getting anywhere takes a while, and Postal 4 ensures that getting around is purposefully frustrating. You can hop on a mobility scooter to travel slightly faster than the Postal Dude's running speed, but finding one isn't as easy as you might expect. There are plenty of mobility scooter rental stations dotted around the map, but hiring one costs $50, which isn't an insignificant amount of money. Charging for these vehicles is especially egregious when they usually disappear if you enter a cutscene or leave them alone for too long, so you'll spend much of your time simply trying to find an abandoned scooter you can commandeer for free.To make matters worse, Postal 4 is riddled with technical issues, particularly when traversing the open world. It's an ugly and dated-looking game, yet even on a powerful PC the frame rate struggles to keep up. Quick-saving is also a necessity because it constantly crashes to desktop. Some of these crashes are completely random, but there are others I could easily replicate. One errand, for example, takes place in a theme park and tasks you with disabling all of its power boxes. I used the game's cumbersome platforming to turn them all off without alerting the gun-toting staff, but the last one was located halfway up a rollercoaster. I assumed that riding the 'coaster was the only way to reach it, but every time I interacted with the cart, the game would immediately crash. The same thing happens with the other two rollercoasters in the park. In the end, I resorted to shooting the power box, which then alerted all of the nearby enemies. You can feasibly complete the game as a pacifist, but it's difficult to do so when the non-lethal approach is broken.The same is true during your aforementioned shift as a prison guard, as you're given a baton with an optional non-lethal mode if you don't want to mindlessly kill everyone. I tried subduing all of the prisoners using this, but at some point it stopped having an effect, forcing me to switch to a lethal option instead.One of the more frequent issues occurs when entering a new area of the open world. There are loading screens between these areas, and the game has a habit of placing you inside a mountain when passing through them. The only way to escape is by reloading a previous checkpoint, but even this doesn't always work as intended. On multiple occasions, I spawned into a broken version of the world where most of the environment had vanished. The only thing you can do in this instance is keep reloading until it eventually decides to work. Even this might not be enough, though. At one point I managed to load back into the game, only to find that I had shrunk down to about two feet tall.There are many more issues besides these. There was one errand where the game broke and wouldn't let me pick up a mission-critical item; on numerous occasions bullets will just stop doing damage; and at one point the game crashed at the end of a level and then locked me inside the closed-off environment after I loaded back in. It's a mess, and many of these shortcomings have been present throughout Postal 4's tenure on Steam Early Access, with no fixes in sight.According to the developer, a number of changes are being made to improve performance and add features. These range from new meshes for some characters and subtitles for different languages, to a physics pass and improved car models. Maybe squashing bugs is also on the agenda, but at this point it's far too late, considering their frequency and severity.Whenever you're not bashing your head against your keyboard because of Postal 4's numerous crashes, you'll be doing so because of its awful attempts at humor. Here's a quick rundown of the main topics Postal 4 finds hilarious: Poop, male and female genitalia, sex, animal cruelty, and Mexicans. Now, I enjoy dark humor, and there's plenty of toilet humor that tickles my funny bone, but this is bottom-of-the-barrel stuff for the lowest common denominator. To give you an example, ""That's a lot of shit,"" is the punchline to seeing a lot of shit. Jeff Goldblum already delivered this joke with better execution 29 years ago.One errand revolves around hosing away piles of poo to stop a group of Mexicans from using them as a secret ingredient in their tacos. Never mind the fact that Mexican food is amazing, this is just unfunny, racist, and trite. There's another gag where some angry white women run over two Mexicans--notice a theme here?--in their truck, just so they can attack me while yelling about cultural appropriation. Obviously, this isn't enough to even induce a smirk, and is just outright bad. Most of the humor in Postal 4 would still feel at home in Postal 2, a game that came out in 2002, and it wouldn't have been funny then either.Even the most recent pop culture references in the game are still fairly dated, with nods to the likes of Breaking Bad, Arrested Development, and Twin Peaks. There's one out-of-the-blue boss fight where you have to kill a Peter Dinklage facsimile who starts by sitting on a Game of Thrones-esque throne that's also a toilet. Why Peter Dinklage, you might be asking? Presumably because it's easy to change his name to ""Tinklage."" That, and the fact that the series has a precedent for making fun of little people. Somewhat surprisingly, the voice acting is fairly decent for the most part, especially considering the material the cast has to work with.Postal 4: No Regerts is devoid of humor and anything close to approaching fun or engaging mechanics. The only things it has in spades are constant technical issues that only compound the game's lengthy checklist of egregious shortcomings. Running With Scissors might consider this review a badge of honor, considering that the game being bad is seemingly part of the gag, but don't for a second think that Postal 4 even touches the realm of ""So bad, it's good."" There's nothing redeemable about this game. It's a genuinely awful experience that should be avoided at all costs."
1762,Destiny,6.0,1,"Destiny and how you will likely feel about The Dark Below. If the problems that have left many a player crestfallen, even angry, in the weeks and months since the game hit haven't affected your need to keep at the constant grindstone week after week, then The Dark Below at least gives your daily runthrough a nice kick in the pants for a few days. The scenario is that new non-player character Eris Morn is one of six warriors sent to go kill big baddie Crota (whose sword you wield during one of the early missions on The Moon in the campaign). She is the only one who survived, and she is now enlisting the help of Guardians to help finish what she started. Eris as a persistent storyteller is a good one, a better one than your previous companion (known affectionately as Dinklebot) at least, and her desperation and post-traumatic stress disorder lurk behind every word. Of course, that story is in one ear and out the other, as it is with most of Destiny's campaign content. You get an initial mission in the Cosmodrome as an appetizer, and it's there to introduce the new screaming female wizard baddie, Omnigul, and a new debuff called Weight of Darkness that comes into play when you start the raid called Crota's End. From there follows a random spewing of new content, all to get your character good and ready to take on Crota's End, the main event. Ultimately, instead of building on Destiny to offer something we haven't seen or fixing some of the game's biggest issues, all The Dark Below does is amplify everything both good and terrible about Destiny. The core mechanics haven't changed and don't need to, since the gunplay is the one thing that Bungie nailed right out of the gate. The campaign missions to stop the Hive from resurrecting Crota are challenging, occasionally unique (one of the early sections involves a hectic firefight in planetary AI Rasputin's core while classical music plays as a warning siren), but ultimately meaningless. Most of them are all too similar to the missions you’ve played hundreds of times before, and the rewards are paltry, with the exception of the new fusion rifle Murmur, which at least has some elemental tricks up its sleeve. The same goes for the PlayStation-exclusive Strike, which is disappointingly, painfully short. Better rewards can be had in the new Daily and Weekly Heroics, though these two missions are tied directly to the add-on, so should you not splurge on The Dark Below, there will be weeklies you will not have access to. As it is, the two current missions, even if you manage to roll deep with a fireteam, are aggravatingly difficult. Because of these limitations, to stand even a ghost of a chance with most of the new content, you must grind and grind often. The Dark Below ostensibly requires you to be level 28, but there's very little in the pack that approaches doable or fun until you're at 29 or better. The new multiplayer maps--Cauldron, Pantheon, and Skyshock--are fun enough, though fairly nondescript as far as multiplayer maps go, not giving nearly as much of the verticality that the original maps deliver so well. Skyshock in particular can be a vast, empty nightmare on small-team playlists or a frustrating, sniper-filled hellhole when there's more. All this is Destiny's biggest post-game problem in a nutshell: After level 20, the game, at its worst, actively impedes you from having fun, and at best, it artificially extends the amount of time you need to spend with it. Even with the tweaks that have been made--the ability to purchase upgrade materials from vendors instead of farming, improved weapon drops, the new level cap--everything you do is in aid of reaching arbitrary goals. The list of grueling tasks continues to grow, and you can add the brand new insanity that is upgrading Exotic equipment to the list. (If you had Exotics before purchasing The Dark Below, then your progress is now dependent on Xur even having your item in stock that week to upgrade it, unless you are lucky enough to find the new version of the Exotic as a drop.) The add-on exacerbates the frustration by making the new content reliant on your Guardian being at the highest level possible, which, as it always has, relies on repeating content you've already seen countless times already. Arguably, the game tries to compensate by making new gear accessible to whoever can afford it from vendors, but that has the added effect of rendering the last two months of many players' work useless, especially the folks who struggled through Vault of Glass. Ironically, the most fun part of the DLC is a quest to fill a special urn, purchased from weekend vendor Xur. It's a five-step quest in the vein of the Exotic Bounties, with a nice, varied set of objectives and no level requirements. The quest also contains what's possibly the most enjoyable objective in the entire game thus far, where, instead of participating in a normal Public Event in Earth's Skywatch, you get a message stating, ""The enemy is moving against each other,"" which triggers a large-scale Fallen/Hive war, involving every enemy type from both factions. In the middle of the chaos, you must kill a tough-as-nails boss knight called Urzok the Hated. The quest is pure madness, and any players passing through can participate; it’s the kind of event that Destiny should provide far more often. Upon killing Urzok, a quest on The Moon opens up and asks you to kill waves and waves of higher-level enemies using one of Crota's swords, all while the floor is pitted with fiery panels of death. It's hard, but at no point does the mission feel unfair, nor does it seem as though your enemies are there just to soak up bullets. It's Destiny at its most clever, and though the reward doesn't necessarily justify the effort, the game would shine so much brighter were it to provide more of this brand of fun rather than expecting you to spend 20 minutes in the Crucible to earn three more pathetic marks so that you may one day afford your 75-mark weapon. As mentioned, all of this is the lead-up to the big show, which is Crota's End. Much like Vault of Glass, it involves a lot of organization: Bungie still offers no raid matchmaking and expects you to have friends that own Destiny and are willing to coordinate play times. Crota’s End also brings with it plenty of rough fights, along with an over-reliance on ""somebody needs to stand here and wait"" puzzles. The raid doesn’t do much creatively with the landscape, perspective, enemy placement, or enemy types, but there's at least some combat variety and plenty of visually stunning backdrops to ogle when you get a moment to pay attention. The first moments are almost awe-inspiring, beginning with a leap of faith into an endless abyss, along with a horde of Thrall and a steadily dying light that eventually restricts your ability to move altogether. It's then 20 minutes of fumbling around in the dark with your team, trying to activate new sources of light, and many a mad dash away from lamps that explode once lit. What follows is a series of last stands in which you must wait upon panels to magically build bridges between one platform and the next, and are then beset upon by high-level bullet sponges. Vault of Glass started similarly, though the stakes are higher here: endless waves of thrall and durable knights swarm you, all while you try to coordinate who remains on platforms, who picks off the Thrall, and who functions as a veritable team medic. It isn't uncommon to simply stall for time just long enough for a single gunner to make the run across a platform--and there's very little in gaming as satisfying as the sigh of relief when most of the team is dead, and someone still manages to cross the final bridge. Collectively, these encounters feel like an attempt to do something beyond the norm, but the challenge makes it a demanding adventure that won't necessarily end in victory. As expected, Crota’s End is highly difficult, and as with Vault of Glass, while there's a recommended level of 28, you're not making a dent in the thing until you hit 30-32, which, of course, involves repeating content, over and over, until you get there. To be fair, however, reaching level 30 is certainly easier now than it once was. If you're interested in The Dark Below, you know what kind of game Destiny is. You're okay with the grinding. You have a like-minded clan that you play with frequently. You've been level 30 since October. You spend two or three hours a day racking up resources just in case. You are the Destiny player the game wants, which essentially means that you are a farmer. You find out what kind of product you want, and you invest the herculean time and energy needed to obtain it and then nurture it with constant love to bring it to fruition until you decide to destroy it and plant something new in its place. This is Destiny’s circle of life, and The Dark Below does just enough to feed it, if not enough to make it thrive."
1694,World of Van Helsing: Deathtrap,7.0,2,"Deathtrap is one of those genre mash-ups that make you wonder why we haven't seen more of them in recent years, and it's almost a foregone conclusion that we're going to see a lot more of them, and soon. It's an absorbing tower defense game mashed up with a dark, gothic, top-down action role-playing game, and it's just as fun as both. The setup is simple. You play as a magic-spamming sorceress, a melee-fighting warrior, or a stealthy gunslinger who must stop waves of snarling demons from reaching a portal on your side of the isometric-perspective stage and thus getting out of their realm and into ours. You do have plain-Jane Diablo-style attacks and a few area-clearing special attacks later on, but they can only do so much damage before the enemies run past you. Your one ace in the hole against the never-ending horde is the ability to activate long-dormant magical traps in the environment along the demons' pre-set route, which can be anything from simple gun turrets and floor spikes to towers that shoot lightning at random intervals, acid pools, and portals that generate little snarling beasts of your own that turn into little snarling suicide bombers that explode when they reach the nearest enemy. Victory means putting together a sadistic Rube Goldberg conveyor belt of doom through which no demon can pass and, if they do, walking in yourself to try to finish the job.   Deathtrap is, technically, a spin-off of developer Neocore Games's Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing games, liberally retooling the tower defense mode from the first game in the series. The story does link up, but despite some snippets of backstory thrust upon the player when selecting a stage, it's not necessary to jump right into the fray. What you do end up needing is some instructions, and while the tutorial pop-ups will give you a 10-cent tour of the interface, figuring out the game's flow requires plenty of trial and error. It's not necessarily a bad thing. Most of the game is easy enough to figure out for anyone who's played a game in either genre, with one button for regular attacks, one for a powerful magic attack, and traps costing Essence, and special points that regenerate after each wave and any time you kill an enemy. There's a tiny frustration where, often, your best vantage point is a few feet away from the action, and clicking the left mouse at the wrong place and the wrong time will send your character into a 30-monster murder pit from which there's no escape. Nevertheless, you do learn to compensate, and there are RPGs with far worse navigation problems than an overly sensitive playing field. It's still the best of both of its worlds. This structure fixes the tower defense problem of having to wait around for your enemies to come to you before the action begins by letting you get yourself right into the thick of it, and any moment of overwhelming odds can be fixed by letting your death machines do the dirty work. The first few stages do go pretty easy on you until you get your first new traps, and the steady escalation of difficulty is good. Much of the leveling-up and character advancement is contingent on what feels comfortable for the player. How you end up killing baddies will determine what upgrades and new traps you get access to. If your boots are on the ground doing more killing than your traps, you'll get access to powers that make enemies more vulnerable to your melee attacks. Use a particular trap that summons a vicious hell beast to fight anything that walks past? Kill enough baddies with him, and you'll get the ability to summon a group of archers to fight at long range. There's a pretty extensive number of upgrades to earn, and the game hits the sweet spot of doling out just enough experience and skill points after matches to feel like you've earned them, without being able to run completely roughshod over the game. There's also a plain old RPG store where you can buy armor, weapons, and accessories, as well as a compulsory crafting system that was used all of once in my playthrough and then ignored. Still, there's no lack of options for players to get their gameplay just how they like it. Problematically, Deathtrap runs out of content the second it really starts to take off. It happens around the fifth or sixth stage, which is the point at which the game seems to run out of new enemies to throw at you and just starts giving the older, bigger ones more HP. Completing the 13th and final stage after a couple of hours of play earns you nothing, unless you count the unlocking of five specialized scenario maps. Deathtrap's roots as an overblown minigame show here. There are a few twists that you can use to try to keep the stages fresh. Getting to level 15 opens up the Scenario mode, which allows you to put new restrictions on each stage (e.g., less Essence regeneration in exchange for more gold/XP at the end), and the Endless mode, which is a non-stop survival mode where Essence is shorter in supply and the monsters are greater in number. There's a level editor that might yield some quality if the game takes off, as well as multiplayer co-op and versus modes, all of which are fun, but it still has you replaying the same stages over and over. There's no fanfare or reward for beating the stages as they currently are, just the pressing urge to earn more XP and open up the level-20 traps. The good news is that Deathtrap is compelling enough that loading it up once in a blue moon to explode some monsters could end up being extremely appealing and fun. It's a nifty little time-waster that Neocore's created here, and while there could and should be a lot more content in the future, the game we've got right now nonetheless makes a convincing bid for your time."
2268,Disgaea D2: A Brighter Darkness,8.0,2,"     Those features are pretty standard for the series, but new to Disgaea D2 are mounted attacks and follow-up attacks based on characters' affinity for each other. The magichange system of Disgaea 3 and 4 has been replaced with a ""mount"" command that lets a humanoid character ride on a friendly monster unit. The monster handles movement and takes damage, while the human character does the attacking and uses skills (save for special mounted abilities requiring both characters). The mount system is very useful, allowing monsters to protect weaker characters while leveling and giving additional movement options. There are some drawbacks, though: mounted units can't throw other characters, and some skills are unusable while riding. Also new to the game is a character affinity system. As you interact with characters both at Laharl's castle base and in combat, units develop affection (or, in some cases, spite) toward each other. This affects the potential for units to follow up a strike with an attack of their own, or--when defending--to step in and take damage in place of another unit. There's no faster way to wreck a relationship than to accidentally wound allies, however, and since Disgaea games feature friendly fire, you need to be extra careful where you're aiming.  For starters, the evility and skill-learning systems have been completely overhauled. Evilities--inherent, permanent effects a character of a certain class is given--are now chosen and assigned at character creation, as are weapon aptitude boosts. Unlike Disgaea 3 and 4, where skills needed to be purchased and upgraded with mana points, Disgaea D2 returns to a system where weapon and magic skills are learned and increase as they are used, with higher-aptitude weapons leveling more quickly. Making skill learning even more engaging is a revised apprenticeship system, where units can be freely assigned an apprentice that they can pass on battle skills to. Apprentices can be swapped and assigned at will, allowing for quicker skill learning and passing of abilities onto units that might not earn them normally (such as magic skills for non-magic units). Disgaea 3 and 4 introduced some interesting--though rather cumbersome--systems to pass on skills and boost individual character stats as you carefully leveled them up. Disgaea D2 makes managing stat boosts a cinch through demon training: you simply assign a unit to a certain type of training and earn additional stat gains from leveling up. If you want to get even more specific in your grinding, there's the cheat shop, which lets you change certain game elements at will. Have enough money but not enough experience? Take some percentage points from HL yield and put them into boosting EXP past 100 percent. Want to kill stronger enemies for better bonuses? Set the monster strength higher. You can even set certain handicaps, like being unable to cancel actions, if you want to make the game more of a challenge.  "
1375,Dead Star,7.0,2,"After warring factions decimate most life in the universe, a new era of peace emerges. Dead Star focuses on the prison system, where those who dare to defy this peace are thrown without hope of reprieve. Underneath the burning red light of a dying star and policed by an AI warden who destroys any ships that try to leave, this barren landscape is filled with resources, old ship carcasses, and asteroids.Dead Star controls much like a twin-stick shooter, but with a lot more limitations. Unlike most pure arcade-style shooters, weapon range heavily impacts strategy. You’ll start off in a weak, underpowered ship with incredibly limited firing range, which keeps you focused on close-quarters combat. It’s a wise move, especially during crowded battles, when rampant cross-fire can lead to mass frustration.Between the limited range and power consumption of the many weapon system options, Dead Star manages to become much more tactical in nature than a similar single-player game might be. Wild, desperate shooting usually leads to a quick death, forcing you to learn the ins and outs of your ship and load out during the game's early stages.The variety of weapons is a big draw. There's the standard array of quick firing lasers, missiles, and other familiar sci-fi shooter mainstays, but as things progress, newer ships and options offer impressively strategic and creative slower firing weapons: huge energy balls that roll forward through space surrounded by clouds of destructive power and other big risk/big reward weapons of mass destruction.There are AI drones that will follow and orbit your ship to provide extra support as well, and each ship offers myriad upgrade options. Dead Star features three different development tracks for ships (with a fourth on the way), each focused on a specific alien race. Within each track are three ship types offering distinctly different play experiences. The Scouts are fast and maneuverable, but light on firepower. Raiders are slower, but offer great attack potential. For tank-lovers, the frigate-class vessels offer size and potentially immense destructive power, but their large size and slow speed means they need a lot of support.Each line of ships has a distinct look and weapon style, but, as expected in multiplayer games, don’t differ enough from their alien counterparts to create gameplay imbalances. In addition to pure ship-on-ship action, the landscapes sport their own set of dangers and opportunities. The Dead Star system is a battlefield graveyard, full of dead ships and the burnt leftovers of destroyed planets. Giant tunneled-out rocks float through space, allowing players to hide and discover ore deposits. Smaller obstacles need to be avoided, which can be challenging in the heat of combat.Mine ore is traded at home bases for currency that allows for ship upgrades and players also earn upgrades through level progression. This gives Dead Star a solid sense of continuity without being a completely persistent world, and this sense of forward momentum is vital to the experience.In the standard Conquest mode, two teams fight to take over specific AI-controlled base stations. When one team conquers the whole sector, they win. Its simple to get into and allows for a wide range of play styles. Players who just want to fly around and blow things up will be just as at home as those who prefer to tactically take over real estate and provide support.Get far enough in Conquest mode and the Escape Run mode will unlock, which plays directly into Dead Star's overall plot. It seems that the system’s sun is about to literally die—it could go supernova any time, destroying everything in its path. So, the inmates are in a fervor to find a leftover capital ship from the old war and warp out of there. Escape Run lets a team of four commandeer a capital ship and attempt to make it through multiple sectors to reach a jump point (thus winning the match). The gimmick is that those sectors are actually other Conquest games in progress.When a capital ship enters a Conquest match, the focus suddenly turns from the two teams killing each other to both teams aligning to destroy the capital ship as it slowly moves through the sector. The four-person team onboard the big ship must exit the ship and defend it against the Conquest teams. This three-way fight is one of the most interesting and creative multiplayer modes we’ve seen in a long time, and makes the overall game far more involving as a result.Completing an Escape Run successfully also leads to rare items and rewards unavailable in the standard Conquest mode. Unfortunately, Dead Star only features these two modes, and feels a bit light as a result. There were also some noticeable issues with in-game lag, resulting in ships suddenly jumping around. It was a fairly minor issue overall, but enough to be annoying."
4008,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon",5.0,1," Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up based on the movie that swept through theaters in the summer of 2000. While the game does a good job of telling the story of the film through the still photographs and text dialogue that appear between certain levels, it doesn't deliver much in the way of hands-on thrills except for a few instances where you can leap across rooftops and jump back and forth between walls.      Players assume the role of Jen Yu, the young thief from the film. Each of the game's 25 levels is set up like a scene from the movie. The opening stage has Jen jumping from rooftop to rooftop, using the pilfered Green Destiny sword to fight off the guards that are trying to prevent her escape from Sir Te's compound. As the game goes on, you'll play through levels that require you to fight through dozens of armed enemies, levels that make you navigate doorways and secret rooms, levels that shift the focus away from combat toward climbing or platform-jumping, and other levels that feature activities inspired by the movie--such as running on water and horseback riding.   Even though it's clear that the developers put some effort into creating levels that would remind players of situations from the movie, they didn't do enough to incorporate Jen's moves into the environment. Jen plays like Ryu Hayabusa from the old NES Ninja Gaiden games. She has a few basic attacks that can be performed on the ground or in the air. After you jump, you have the option of performing another jump in midair or pushing off of walls in order to climb. Finally, a chi meter at the top of the screen allows you to perform one of eight different movie-themed special attacks. The meter fills gradually with the energy you gain by defeating enemies. Despite what sounds like a healthy variety of moves, there are only one or two instances per level where you need to make use of Jen's double jump or wall climb maneuvers. As a beat-'em-up, it's easy to appreciate how one enemy after another can be slaughtered just by repeatedly pressing the B button and throwing in a few jump kicks. But there are better beat-'em-ups on the GBA, especially when you consider that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon only takes an hour to complete.      With the exception of a few clever levels and the snazzy photographs that appear between levels, everything else about Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon comes across as flimsy. The graphics are hit or miss. Some stages take advantage of the GBA's ability to display thousands of colors and multiple scrolling backgrounds--and some don't. One level will have bamboo trees in the foreground and semitransparent fog in the background, while the next will be made up of a few gray buildings set in front of a darker gray background. The character graphics for Jen and the other fighters are colorful and smoothly animated, but they're also tiny and not altogether interesting. Even the audio is inconsistent. The music is great and sounds almost like an orchestra at times, but the sound effects are tinny and repeat frequently.   Unless you absolutely want to own a video game based on Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, there's really no worthwhile reason to add this one to your collection.  "
4411,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,4.0,0,"The recently released Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone games are based on the blockbuster movie, which in turn is based on J.K. Rowling's novel starring a young wizard. As the introduction cuts through its series of still images and background text, you will learn that Harry Potter is an orphaned child left in the care of cruel muggle (a nonmagical human) foster parents. Upon receiving an admissions letter, Harry leaves home with a friendly giant and makes his way to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. While undergoing magical instruction, Harry will face such challenges as competing in the wizards' sport of quidditch and foiling the plot of the evil wizard Voldemort. The PlayStation version of Harry's quest drops you in a 3D re-creation of Hogwarts that is simply huge and a pleasure to explore. Once it comes time for a challenge, however, the game falls decidedly flat. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone makes a valiant effort to re-create the visual splendor of the recent film on the dated PlayStation hardware. The developers have succeeded in creating an extensive castle that is true to the stories, with plenty of rooms to explore and many secrets to be found. There are a variety of characters to meet, and each looks quite different from the last. Unfortunately, sloppy, underdetailed textures are used in many cases, and the entire game seems to be made up of extremely jagged polygons. While no technical marvel, the gameworld is quite colorful and has a distinct artistic flair. The many cinematic sequences are rendered in real time, but they are so overused that it doesn't take long for their effectiveness to wear off. On the other hand, the bedtime-story-style narration is performed admirably, as is the work of the many voice actors who bring the Hogwarts characters to life. The same team from the PC version of the game provides the many recorded speech segments, and if you haven't seen the movie, then you can enjoy these renditions of the beloved roles without skipping a beat. Sadly, the music in the PlayStation version doesn't come close to comparing to the excellent composition available in the PC version. Most of the time there is no ambient music, and the game feels remarkably silent most of the way through. Playing Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is similar to playing a greatly simplified version of Spyro or the latest Legend of Zelda. There are frequent platform elements, as well as creatures that need to be eliminated with the force of your flipendo spell. The game uses a strafe-friendly targeting system that makes the few shooting challenges far too simple, but this doesn't quite compare to the travesty of the platforming sequences. There is no jump command, so in most cases, simply walking to the edge of a platform will get you clear to the opposite side, regardless of distance, which is automatically accounted for. Other games have used the auto-jump effectively, but in this case, what could possibly have been one of the sole challenging aspects of the game has been made so simple that flying through the game in a handful of hours is par for the course. That nothing is unlocked upon the game's completion, like the stand-alone quidditch game from the PC version, is yet another in a series of disappointments. One of the more enjoyable and game-worthy aspects of the Harry Potter stories is the game of quidditch--a combination of soccer and basketball played by wizards on broomsticks. Harry's role in quidditch as seeker is to chase down an evasive little ball called the golden snitch as the game plays on around him. Chasing down the snitch earns your team a victory and in theory makes for an exciting, fast-paced diversion from the otherwise bland fare being provided. Once you've become accustomed to the smooth analog movement in the rest of the game, the choppy, stuttering flight controls while on a broomstick will leave nearly all players extremely disappointed. It's a sad thing indeed when a lackluster minigame of flying through rings eclipses the fun to be had elsewhere in the game. No matter how much you care for the idea of flying on a broomstick or weaving fantastic magicks, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a lesson in boredom. Without a jump command, the platforming elements are all but wasted, while the spell-flinging portions of the game are equally forgettable. Those of you who have paid close attention to the Harry Potter stories will find that many of the memorable details from the books and movie have been included to make the experience as genuine as possible. Despite this attractive aspect of the game, its overly simple gameplay mechanics and extremely short duration add up to a game that should be avoided by most. Ultimately, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone doesn't have the widespread appeal of its literary namesake and is suitable only for children."
2394,The Night of the Rabbit,7.0,2,"      Fantastic art direction is what really draws you in here. For a game like The Night of the Rabbit to be effective, for it to instill in you the same wanderlust that young Hazelnut has, the world itself must be inviting and begging to be poked and prodded by an adventurer. Thankfully, the environments are gloriously detailed and often look like hand-drawn pages from children's storybooks. Colors are vibrant, lines are heavy but have a subtle sketched look, and the attention to detail is clear throughout. The level of commitment is enough to keep an otherwise hackneyed setting (20th-century England) more than varied enough to have you enthralled for the length of Jerry's quest--provided that you can get through the rather slow start.          "
22,Cocoon,9.0,2,"Cocoon, the debut game from Geometric Interactive, is a surreal and intimate puzzle game that is also beautifully complex. Considering the pedigree of its gameplay designer--Jeppe Carlsen of Limbo and Inside fame--perhaps this shouldn't be too surprising, but it didn't stop me from continuously being in awe of just how tight and intelligent the overall experience was. This, paired with fantastic sound design and art, both synthetic and organic--lush yet scarce--makes for a memorable experience.Cocoon sees you take on the role of a cicada-like creature moments after it emerges from a womb of petals. Without fanfare, exposition, or any guidance, this creature is thrust into an orange, arid, and largely desolate world. There are few enemies to be found in Cocoon, to be sure, but all of them are relegated to closed off arenas, where you must use quick thinking and evasion to get the best of them. While some of these boss battles are incredibly engaging (and others, not quite as much), combat is not the focus in Cocoon--it's exploration.In the game's open world, only ancient-looking structures that pulse with strange power keep you company. Your mission, then, is simple: Use these structures to keep pushing forward. Why you are meant to push forward is never made explicit, but it also doesn't feel like it needs to be. There seems to be this intangible force that compels you to--this notion that moving forward is both benevolent and part of the journey you must take.The way you progress is, on paper, quite simple. The game uses just five buttons--one for each of the four cardinal directions and one to interact--and most structures you encounter are powered on by inserting an orb into the proper place. However, what's theoretically simple can quickly grow complex.Within these orbs are entire worlds which you can enter by placing them in the middle of a mechanical structure that then reflects the environment in a shallow pool of water. You can seamlessly transition between worlds, and solving puzzles in one will, in turn, help you progress through others. Where it truly gets complex is how often you are required to place worlds within worlds so that situations play out precisely as they need to for you to advance. Additionally, holding on to these world orbs grants you unique powers. When clutching the orange orb, for example, your cicada can reveal paths it wouldn't otherwise be able to walk on, while the seafoam green orb allows you to use what I can only best describe as water elevators.Timing, utilizing these powers in the right order, and abstract thinking becomes key to progression. There's a logic the game silently teaches you as you solve these puzzles--a set of rules that you learn fairly quickly. But while Cocoon's fundamental mechanics rarely change, the ways in which you use them continue to expand throughout the game. I found myself thinking, ""Wait, can I do this?"" only to be met with a resounding yes time and time again. It's amazing how something so simplistic can be brilliant--and not only that, but it makes you feel brilliant. Piecing together how the laws of this universe work, and testing to see just how far they extend, is an extraordinary experience--one that keeps your mind engaged and your curiosity piqued.And while all this might sound complicated (and don't get me wrong, some of the puzzles can be head-scratchers), none of it is overwhelming thanks to the game isolating what you need to be focused on to progress. If an area doesn't relate to the current puzzle you are trying to solve, it will be inconspicuously closed off. This prevents the frustration that can occur in puzzle games where you are frantically backtracking, wondering what small detail you missed or if there was something you did previously that was incorrect. It subtly informs you that you are exactly where you need to be, thus narrowing down all the potential variables to a manageable number.Subtlety is also a concept that works its way into the game's sound design. While your journey through Cocoon is often quiet, it's a very purposeful silence that builds into swelling compositions, like the bass-heavy track that accompanies boss battles or the gentle motif that plays when you solve a puzzle correctly. But overall, there's an eeriness to Cocoon's sound that is not unsettling, but atmospheric.This is heightened by the game's art direction, which is full of juxtaposing visuals that create both unease and wonder. Whereas the world is filled with metal structures and perfect geometry, there is also an organic feel to it--this sense that you are within a living organism, brushing up against Golgi bodies, vessels, vesicles, and other apparatuses. Yet these imperfect and bulbous creations manage to feel intricate and intentional as you consider the functions they serve in living things. Another intelligent design choice was assigning a distinct color palette to each of the game's worlds. Considering all the juggling, traveling, and the way Cocoon embraces this idea of recursion, it helps keep you aware of where you are. But while there is an array of different colors, all of them are gently muted, as to create harmony between all these disparate worlds.It is thanks to its artistic subtlety and lack of an explicit narrative that Cocoon encourages your mind to wander and extract what I believe to be its biggest takeaway and a harsh truth: Our greatest journeys--the ones that give us purpose and guide our personal evolution--are insignificant in the grand scheme of things. And sure, there's a certain sense of powerlessness that sinks in when you try to process that information; it's the same gut-punch feeling that comes when you begin to consider the sheer size of our ever-expanding universe. But there's also liberation. And perhaps most importantly, it doesn't make what we endure and what we become any less valuable to the world we are creating for ourselves. While the game's slightly abrupt ending detracts from this message somewhat, it still manages to come through.Cocoon, as the name suggests, is a game about self-evolution. From the moment you emerge from the womb-like structure at the game's beginning, pushing forward and learning are your primary focuses--even if what you're ultimately accomplishing feels a bit unclear. But it's also about how the self is but a small part of life--how entire worlds can fit in an insect's tarsal segments. From its puzzles to its visuals, Cocoon is a beautiful game filled with brilliance and meaning, delivered in a subtle yet unforgettable way."
4432,Ju-on: The Grudge,4.0,0,"  Touted as a haunted-house simulator, Ju-On: The Grudge is a no-frills horror game that capitalizes on the reasonably successful film series of the same name. It uses the same hook found in the movies: cursed ghouls born of a violent death that consume all who enter their domain, including a victim's family. There are a few good scares, but its harsh brevity, troublesome controls, and extraordinarily shallow gameplay mechanics thoroughly squash its potential.        The game begins with a tense sequence: You are investigating pitch-black areas in first-person view with nothing but a flashlight to protect you from the haunting monstrosities--at least until you run out of juice. The bulk of the gameplay is composed of cheap thrills, such as hands that reach out of nowhere to grab you or figures that suddenly pop onscreen. Although the obvious scare tactics soon become tired and monotonous, they manage to be a little unnerving. You'll spot a lot of subtle horrors, like figures that dissipate when you approach or bloody handprints on the walls, that are much more chilling than the game's constant use of second-rate shocks; unfortunately, they're not implemented well enough to truly spook you. Attack sequences are somewhat rare but are a bit more fun and spine-tingling, preceded by elaborate creature entrances and pulse-pounding music as a ghoul grabs you. You have only a few seconds to ""shake"" the creature away with the Wii Remote, and though the sequences are enjoyable, they're regrettably the height of the game's limited interactivity.     Ju-On has the foundation of a decent horror game, but unfortunately it sacrifices gameplay for its movie-like thrills. You spend most of your time searching for flashlight batteries and locating the keys you need to advance. The game never matures to include any kind of puzzle elements or combat, culminating in a mundane and outdated experience that's ultimately unsatisfying. This gross lack of depth makes the game far too easy to finish, because you'll rarely run out of batteries or get stuck since items shine in the dark. Level design is also simplistic and limited in scope. There are a lot of off-limit areas in this highly linear game, and levels generally amount to following ghosts between unchallenging key searches. The game also suffers from awkward, somewhat unresponsive controls and a finicky camera that requires noticeable effort to tame. You control the camera by tilting the remote, but the slightest of tilts will cause it to swing wildly, at other times it will stick or you'll experience an annoying delay. This makes something as straightforward as climbing the stairs irritating. Command prompts, which are used to trigger escape scenes, are especially aggravating because they're sometimes misinterpreted no matter how furiously you shake the Wii Remote.      Sound effects and music culled from the movies do a good job of scaring you; plenty of horrific audio cues await you in the dark, from the pitter-patter of bloody footsteps to the ghastly, inhuman growls the films are known for, although these deep, gurgling screams become less menacing as you progress because they're overused. Music is eerie but mostly reserved for attack sequences, focusing less on setting the mood and more on making you jump, but it's alarming enough to get your heart racing. Aesthetically, the game pulls off a creepy ambiance, with rusted lockers, splintering furniture, and disturbing mannequins decorating the dilapidated locales. Jagged edges are prominent and worsen the game's dated feel, although the dark color palette does help to mask the inadequacies. The ghosts are strikingly hideous and perfectly mirror their dreadful celluloid counterparts, down to their rotting flesh and bulging eyes.        One aspect more appalling than the game's creatures is its almost total lack of replayability. It's terribly short, with only five stages that amount to an hour and a half's worth of gameplay, or roughly 20 minutes each. Once you've cleared a stage, you're accustomed to its spook tactics and scripted scenes, so there's no joy or challenge in repeating it. The multiplayer option is so pathetic it's laughable. As the second player your goal is to scare player one by spamming them with cheesy, repetitive ""panic scenes."" Your arsenal of fear includes such terrifying tricks as causing blood to envelop the screen and making pieces of creature artwork pop-up. They're every bit as scary as they sound, and these silly interruptions are more likely to cause irritation than a good scare.      Despite Ju-On film director Takashi Shimizu's supervision, the game features noticeably few plot elements to tie its levels together or provide character depth. Consequently, there's a sharp disconnect between characters and their stages, which completely undermines the game's attempt to immerse you into the films' world. Although these characters are a family unit, the game rarely mentions that fact and glosses over the curse's significance, leaving you clueless as to what's going on unless you've closely followed the movies.     You’ll encounter a few substandard thrills while The Grudge lasts, but its clumsy controls and one-dimensional mechanics are more likely to send you running than its ghastly fiends are. Even Ju-On film fans will probably want to look elsewhere for this season's festive frights.  "
2104,DUST 514,6.0,1,"EVE Online universe, player corporations vie for dominance over planetary regions, and those planetside battles are fought by brave Dust warriors with the assistance of the friendly ships that orbit above. This merging of massively multiplayer space intrigue and ground-based action prompts the imagination to create all kinds of incredible scenarios, with dropships transporting squads of soldiers to hot spots while spaceships bombard the ground from above, each participant doing his or her part for a larger political cause.      PlanetSide 2-type skirmishes, with dozens upon dozens of players converging on various explosive hot spots. Instead, this is a standard team-based multiplayer shooter in which teams of limited numbers take aim at each other with various rifles and rocket launchers, or perhaps from behind a rumbling tank's mounted railgun.      The shooting is functional, neither remarkable enough to call out Dust 514 as a genre leader, nor so poor as to render it unenjoyable. It's just serviceable, working well enough once you get used to a few idiosyncrasies. The controls are one such idiosyncrasy: there's a bit of mushiness to the movement, so the game never feels as snappy as you'd hope, though it takes only a bit of time to become accustomed to the general feel. You might think that using a mouse and keyboard would alleviate the sluggishness, but the mouselook is slow and goopy even when sensitivity is set to maximum, and the game doesn't change its onscreen prompts to accommodate the new controls, leaving you to fumble around until you figure things out for yourself.        Stationary turrets and vehicular guns also prove rather cumbersome, in contrast to the bounciness of the light attack vehicles. Other issues affect the shooting range, from the minor (you may not hear any audio cue when sniped, leaving you to momentarily wonder why you're taking damage) to the major (frame rate hitches at the worst possible times). Still, Dust 514 is fun when you squad up with buddies and wade into the fray, presuming your team uses a diversity of tactics. When playing with randoms, it's rare that anyone takes on a support role; in such cases, only occasionally do you see a dropship--Dust 514's only aerial vehicle--in play, nor do many randoms seem keen on reviving you on the battlefield should you fall. That's possibly due to the finicky collision detection, which can make it difficult to use a nanite injector in the heat of battle. Luckily, strangers aren't so stingy with temporary spawn points, dropping them in helpful areas, such as on sniper-guarded roofs, which makes it easy to defend key choke points.      But with friends and other communicative allies, you can bring out the best in Dust 514. A well-placed sniper, a healer at the ready, a heavy weapons specialist, and a couple of large tanks make a formidable attack force. There are moments of excitement during close matches, particularly in Domination (one of four by-the-numbers game modes), in which teams wrestle for control of multiple capture nodes. There's joy in joining a small infiltration squad and capturing peripheral nodes as the larger skirmish rages around another node. And because you still must wait for a virus to finish uploading even after you've interacted with the terminal, it's best to stick around for a while, lest the enemy swoop in and undo your hard work. Some of the tensest moments occur in such scenarios, with one team desperately defending a node still in the process of uploading its virus, knowing that the entire match could hinge on the outcome of the battle.        And so the fun is there, and even common. Yet Dust 514 rarely inspires the kind of controlled chaos that characterizes the best online shooters. Teams move from hot spot to hot spot, shooting each other with tactical assault rifles and autocannons. But with limited vehicle types and many long straightaways on the large maps, there are too few chances for the kinds of heart-stopping conflicts you tell stories about later. Your superior tactics may allow you to triumph, but victory never feels all that victorious. You're rewarded with a win, but not with explosive warfare that could have you shouting triumphant chants with your teammates.      If only the worlds you were fighting for were more intriguing. EVE's humorless space-corporation atmosphere doesn't translate as well on the ground. Brown cliffs and gray military instillations don't instill the sense that you're in a region worth capturing, the low-contrast, monochrome nature of the maps providing you with a place to shoot guns but not much more. Texture resolutions are low enough that you can't always tell whether the full texture has popped in yet, or whether you are looking at a plain placeholder texture. The audio works harder to get the blood flowing, injecting Dust 514 with some much-needed personality. The voice-over that cautions you not to commit suicide in public areas is one such example, though even subtle cues, such as the rubbery buzz that signifies recharging shields, are suitably evocative.         With battlefields this standard and art design this bland, it's amazing that Dust 514 can keep you coming back. And yet it might get its hooks into you, problems aside, almost entirely because of its character persistency. Dust 514 has one of the most extensive and involved skill systems in online shooters, and because it takes significant time to earn skill points, you can become attached to the grind, fighting battle after battle so you may finally earn the right to purchase that fancy laser rifle you've had your eye on.        Great rewards lurk within this skill system, but to uncover them, you must first make sense of Dust 514's interface, which is convoluted and suffers from various redundancies. Certain menus and features are accessible in numerous ways, indicating that there is plenty of room to streamline in the future. The opening tutorials only make matters worse, burying you under an aggressively unhelpful information dump.      You learn how to sort through the infodump, however, leaving you to develop your character in countless ways. It all starts with your dropsuit, which offers a blank slate to create your own class of soldier. You begin with a few generic dropsuits outfitted in specific ways, but you can exercise your creativity almost from the beginning. The character-building metagame is a tactical delight, ultimately leading you to make careful plans about where skill points are best spent. Sure, you might want to upgrade your dropsuit so you can fit more equipment in it--but what about enhancing your vehicular fittings so that you can steamroll the competition within the safe confines of a hulking tank? It takes time to accumulate the skill points you need, so impulsive spending is a big mistake.      The slow progression can be frustrating, too, leading you to spend real-world money on boosters that increase the rate at which you earn skill points. You can also spend money on weapons and such, presuming you find time more valuable than money. Dust 514 sticks to a pay-to-win model, allowing you to purchase some effective weaponry regardless of its skill requirements. Given the protracted nature of progression, you might think spending real money would therefore be irresistible, but most weapons and items are not permanent (unless you nab a blueprint, which is an item's permanent edition), and must be repurchased each time you perish. That's not usually a big deal when using in-game currency, which flows quickly into your coffers. However, should you purchase equipment--say, a predesigned dropsuit fitting--with real-world money, each death means spending a nominal amount of cash. And that cash can add up.       Such an involved skill metagame and economy can lead to battlefield imbalances, pitting you against formidable foes that you feel too underpowered to face, though you get enough credit for kill assists and other support actions to offset resulting frustrations, at least to a degree. Thankfully, the early hours match you with other novices so that you don't feel immediately crushed by the opposition. Even so, crushed you will often be until you learn the ins and outs of Dust 514, and the occasional spark on the battlefield--along with the extended character progression--might be enough to keep you coming back.      Developer CCP's impressive track record of supporting and enlivening EVE Online inspires confidence in Dust 514's future. For now, however, this online shooter relies too much on its connections to EVE to ignite interest, rather than letting the gameplay speak for itself. It's too bad that the gameplay doesn't have anything more exciting to say--and that Dust 514's most compelling feature matters to a relatively small contingent of players. For everyone else, this is a decent game that gives you a lot to look forward to, but the thrills aren't yet common enough to give Dust 514 a competitive edge in a galaxy saturated with good free-to-play shooters.    "
4100,Zoo Hospital,4.0,0,"  Zoo Hospital for the Wii is a cuddly medical-themed puzzler in the style of Atlus' popular Trauma Center franchise. Unfortunately, it has none of the puzzle variation, intensity, or replayability of the Trauma Center games and presents very little challenge or depth. Its puzzles never increase in difficulty, and you're often forced to repeatedly endure the same operation type, compounding your sense of boredom. The sad reality of Zoo Hospital is that it boasts little more than cute animals.       The game opens with you receiving a call from Aunt Lucy, who operates a floundering zoo that's about to be bought out by a sinister businessman determined to replace it with a minigolf course. Your objective, as a licensed veterinarian fresh out of school, is to treat the zoo's animals as Lucy works to secure funding. The plot is rather uninteresting and disjointed, providing little backdrop for the operations you'll perform, though occasionally you'll treat an animal that advances the story.          The bulk of the gameplay is extremely straightforward and easy to master; a map of the zoo is displayed, conveniently marked with icons that let you know when an animal's health is in jeopardy. You merely click on an icon to send a distressed animal to the hospital wing, where you examine it by keeping the cursor inside the middle of a circle representing a magnifying glass. You're usually given five minutes to complete the appropriate operation, which may involve suturing wounds, laser-zapping viruses, applying antibacterial gel to rashes, or even pulling teeth. Each puzzle type requires simple movements of the Wii Remote, such as when you smack giant lice by making a brief, slashing motion, but sometimes, you'll have to shake the controller a little more forcibly to get it to register your movements. You'll encounter a similar control problem in a puzzle in which you guide a Tetris-like object through an animal's intestines because you'll find it difficult for the game to register that you've grabbed the object whenever it has been pushed too close to an obstruction.       Though the operation types are initially varied, you'll soon find yourself performing the same operation several times in a row or tackling the same infection with the same solution, which is irksome because the procedures don't evolve. The operation puzzles are very simplistic; they require almost no strategy and so quickly becoming tedious. For example, in the virus-zapping operation, the goal is to kill the infected cells before they damage the healthy ones, but the infected cells merely float around in no discernable pattern, encountering the healthy cells almost randomly.        Furthermore, most operations have very few stages and are purely external procedures, such as the syringe ""operation"" that requires you to do nothing more than inject an animal with a vaccine to successfully complete it. The game also fails to intensify with progression. The time element that is supposed to apply constant pressure to the gameplay is practically useless because many operations are completed in as little as 30 seconds; you shouldn't even breach the minute mark until you're more than halfway through. Even if you should run out of time or have an animal wake in the middle of an operation, there is no penalty for failure, which makes the gameplay even easier.       Aftercare opportunities are provided in an attempt to add depth, but they fail miserably. Following a 15-second operation, you may revisit your patient to observe it in a limited viewing field with a locked camera. You're sometimes asked to pet an animal's ""sweet spot"" until it rolls over in fits of ecstasy, effectively raising its happiness meter; however, it's difficult to do so given the game's frequent inability to correctly register the area of the animal you're petting. You can pet the creature's leg, where the sweet spot is located, but the game will register its leg as its stomach, which is irritating because you have to correctly pet some animals to proceed. Animals also have a health meter that you can raise by feeding them the appropriate food, but both gauges drain so slowly that they don't impact the gameplay, making animal monitoring a moot point.           Though Zoo Hospital looks better than it did on the DS, it retained several visual blemishes. Its greatest treat is its realistic, highly detailed portrayal of animals that all move fluidly in front of a floral backdrop; however, the local plants feature sharp, jaggy edges, and even the animals sport some very blurry fur. The operation screens have also been updated to feature more accurate body elements under the knife, which match the greater realism of the animals. With 47 species included, you're very likely to find a good representation of your childhood favorite, from its coloring pattern down to its usually accurate distress calls, though a few may have you scratching your head in disbelief. The music is sufficiently low-key during operations and upbeat after successful treatments, but only two primary songs are available, so don't expect any acoustic variety.       The game is surprisingly short; you should be able to complete all of its seven chapters in about five hours, though an epilogue that includes two baby animals and a famous mythological beast might bump you up to six hours. Torus Games did make an effort to increase replayability by adding a two-player cooperative mode to unlock, but the low amount of animal interaction, as well as operation challenge, prevents the feature from really being any fun or useful.       Zoo Hospital is a very bare-bones medical-themed puzzler that is short and dull, focusing on heavily repeated procedures, as well as simplistic operations that require almost no strategy at all. It's a pathetic attempt to capitalize on the Trauma Center formula, which needs more than cuddly creatures to succeed.    "
18,Hellboy: Web of Wyrd,7.0,2,"This all begins with the game's visuals, which successfully emulate Mike Mignola's art style in stunning cel-shaded 3D. It's so faithful to the original comics, in fact, that each frame could be a panel in itself. Striking colors contrast against deep black shadows, where characters and environments appear as though they've been boldly sculpted by thickly painted outlines, achieving the comic book's signature look. When squaring up against a salivating werewolf, it's as if Hellboy's battle with William Grenier in The Wolves of Saint August has leapt off the page. Every moment of Web of Wyrd is a Mignola art piece brought to life, and it's evident Upstream Arcade has a lot of reverence for the source material--a feeling that also extends to the rest of the game.Take Web of Wyrd's roguelite structure as an example--a decision informed by Hellboy's near-invulnerability. It takes an awful lot to kill Hellboy, so when your health reaches zero, rather than dying and resetting at the start of the game for some contrived reason, this snaps the tether connecting you to the Wyrd, sending Hellboy hurtling back into the real world. The Wyrd is a nightmarish dimension that can only be accessed via the mysterious Butterfly House. When this titular dimension starts impacting our reality in locations across the globe, Hellboy and the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence utilize the Butterfly House as a staging ground before embarking on missions within the procedurally generated realms of the Wyrd. From this outpost, you're able to talk to other B.P.R.D. agents, gear up for your next descent, and spend resources on various upgrades to either improve your equipment or Hellboy's physical attributes.So far this is all par for the course when it comes to your usual roguelite. Web of Wyrd is decidedly unusual, though, which quickly becomes clear within the game's first couple of hours. Instead of being tasked with completing the whole game in a single run--after many deaths and upgrades--it's actually split into distinct chapters that break up the traditional roguelite formula. The Wryd is separated into five biomes, each one featuring a unique aesthetic and assortment of deadly creatures, which prevents the journey from becoming stale. The first biome's ancient ruins are home to armored knights wielding swords and shields, for instance, while a sunken city is beset by all manner of amphibious monstrosities. Not only do these enemy types look vastly different from one another, but their disparate attack patterns present a constant and rewarding challenge.Initially, your goal is to delve into each biome one by one and kill the boss within. Once all five have been defeated, you have to venture back into each biome, defeat each boss again, and then journey a tad farther to destroy a structure guarded by three waves of enemies. When you've completed this step, you're challenged with repeating this process--minus overcoming the bosses again--only this time, instead of traveling to each biome one by one, you have to hit them all in a single run.On their own, none of these scenarios are unique, but by gradually building to the final, prolonged run with smaller, bite-sized missions, it freshens up the roguelite formula to create a sense of progression that exists beyond just upgrading your character. This is vital, too, because Web of Wyrd's gameplay loop consists of very few parts. Outside of combat, which eats up the bulk of your time, you're essentially just running down corridors from one combat arena to the next. Traversal is mind-numbingly shallow, so the onus is on the game's action to carry the load.Fortunately, it's up to the task. Web of Wyrd's hand-to-hand combat emphasizes considered play by leaning into Hellboy's bulky frame and powerful Right Hand of Doom. There's palpable heft behind each crunching blow that's inherently satisfying, and the scarcity of healing options makes every encounter fraught with peril. The camera does run into issues when you're fighting near walls, sometimes blocking your view, and it's frustrating that there isn't an indicator for attacks coming from off-screen. Still, the main challenge comes from being able to learn each enemy's attacks and then recognize what's coming. Web of Wyrd is comparable to a game like For Honor in this regard, as the only way to avoid incoming blows is by evading in the right direction, whether you're weaving to the left or right, backing away, or ducking underneath an incoming sword swipe. Additionally, last-second dodges are rewarded with a slow-motion flourish, allowing you to hit back with a counter attack that deals extra stun damage.Once you've broken through an enemy's Toughness meter--a kind of posture bar--Hellboy's handy pistol can inflict the same stun damage, eventually leaving enemies wide open for a devastating heavy attack. You can aim these strikes, too, sending your hapless foe careening into a wall or rickety pillar to deal extra damage. If you don't fancy the pistol, you can opt to equip either a shotgun or grenade launcher. These are reserved for heavy attacks and, much like the pistol, are to be used sparingly due to their lengthy reload animations. Environmental elements like rubble can also be thrown at enemies, and you're able to enter battle with one of three cooldown-limited charms equipped, letting you repel enemies with a shockwave or create a barrier that negates the next incoming attack.Blocking mitigates damage but doesn't prevent it outright, yet blocking at the last possible moment nullifies more damage than usual and also builds up Hellboy's Payback meter. Once this is full, you're able to unleash a Payback Finisher, launching into a cinematic combo that inflicts oodles of pain. Each time you return to the Butterfly House you can spend any currency you've accrued on various upgrades. All of the weapons and charms in your arsenal can be improved multiple times, and you can bump up Hellboy's Toughness and health or gain the ability to survive fatal damage during a run.When inside the Wyrd, you'll also attain different modifiers called Blessings. These power-ups vary from providing you with a health boost to applying a freeze effect to your fists that occasionally locks enemies in place. Blessings are useful, but they never feel essential and don't alter combat in a significant way. You still fight with the same moveset and cadence, only now your pistol might afflict enemies with a status effect that makes them suffer extra environmental damage. The same is true of both weapons and charms, so build variety is practically non-existent. This is a problem in an 11-hour game, yet combat is demanding enough to remain consistently engaging. Tedium can creep in at times when roaming the same biome multiple times in a row, but going mano-e-mano with a 10-foot-tall vampire bat and pounding it into dust with weighty, tactile strikes remains thrilling until the credits roll.There is a story tying all of this together, predominantly told by speaking to the various NPCs spread throughout the Butterfly House. This alludes to Web of Wyrd taking a similar approach to Hades, but these conversations usually have little substance. The late Lance Reddick is unsurprisingly excellent as Hellboy, infusing the character with a different vibe compared to Ron Perlman, but he also doesn't have much to work with. The story isn't bad; it's just unimaginative and predictable to the point where it just sort of exists in the periphery.While the narrative is disappointing, Hellboy: Web of Wyrd's recreation of Mike Mignola's signature art style is mightily impressive, while its twist on the usual roguelite structure establishes a potent sense of progression that drives the journey forward. Its punchy and calculated combat is forced to carry the load of what is otherwise a fairly barebones experience, and it falters here at times, too, with a dodgy camera and lack of variation outside of its multitude of enemy types. Yet it's also the challenging toe-to-toe action that makes Web of Wyrd worth playing. Donning the crown (of the apocalypse) as the best Hellboy game ever made might not sound like an extraordinary achievement, but this is a character that has been starved of games, let alone good ones. Web of Wyrd is exactly that, which is maybe enough."
2079,Don't Starve,7.0,2,"   Minecraft and Terraria to mind, and it's one of the game's strongest hooks. Figuring out how to put each item you collect to good use is a fun process of experimentation. Basic items are relatively easy to cobble together with minimal materials, though creating science and alchemy stations also pushes you further down the crafting rabbit hole by unlocking tons of more elaborate item recipes to pursue. Of course, staying alive long enough to build everything is another story.      Dangers are frequently stacked against you in inventive and sometimes frustrating ways. Exploring, scavenging, harvesting resources, and building are best done in the day. Without a torch or a campfire to provide illumination when night falls, you will be torn to pieces by the demonic creatures that roam the darkness within seconds. Building a fire isn't enough either. You have to have enough wood or other fuel sources to keep it lit throughout the night, which creates a constant state of near panic every time the twilight phase of the day/night cycle arrives. Getting caught without the necessary ingredients for a fire or ample burnable materials to last the night spells instant doom.      Changing seasons also usher in new problems to tackle. Live long enough, and winter rears its frosty head, bringing subzero temperatures that cause you bodily harm if you venture too far from a heat source. Admittedly, these interesting wrinkles add depth and additional difficulty to the already challenging survival mechanics at play. They sometimes tip the scale too far, however, particularly given the plentiful supply of other potentially life-ending obstacles thrown in your path.         Managing your hunger, sanity, and health meters is a meticulous juggling act that demands a lot of your attention too. Food sources are often scarce, leaving you to scavenge berries, pull up wild carrots, and trap small animals early on to keep your belly full. While it's possible to build gardens and cook the meat of large beasts you slay to provide more-sustainable and gut-filling meal options, death by starvation is an omnipresent concern. When your stomach is completely empty, your health depletes rapidly until you die. Your sanity also depletes over time, and as it dwindles, you see more and more shadowy hallucinations and trippy visual effects. These hallucinatory creatures attack if you let your mental well run dry, and they're far from the only beasts you encounter.      From giant cyclops birds and living tree monsters to carnivorous frogs and spiked tentacles, there are lots of creepy critters out there eager to end your existence. The rewards of battling them outright rarely feel like they measure up to the risk involved. Point-and-click combat is unfulfilling, since you basically stand there and whack away until someone dies. Often that's you. Slain foes may yield crucial ingredients for crafting and survival, but enemies are just as likely to kill you with a few quick hits before you have a chance to finish them off. Even docile critters can turn deadly with only the slightest provocation, since they tend to rally their pals in large numbers and come chasing after you en masse.     Dying wouldn't be such a big deal if it didn't wipe your progress away permanently. While other roguelikes make it easy to get up and running, building a foundation for survival in Don't Starve is labor-intensive and monotonous at times. When you finally gain a decent foothold on survival after spending so much time chopping wood, scavenging sticks, and fighting for your life, losing it all in a split second is absolutely agonizing. You lose steam after being wiped out a few dozen times and forced to start the whole process over from a few twigs and berries. Every day you stay alive in each run does add toward your total experience points, but that only unlocks a handful of additional characters to play.      Adventure mode ups the danger and frustration substantially too, since it requires you to hunt down pieces to assemble portals across five increasingly tough world maps. Die once in, and you're kicked back to Survival mode, outside a portal. Granted, when this cycle gets too irritating, you can manually tweak the frequency of most resources, monsters, and perils before starting a new run. But it's hard to find the sweet spot between painfully hard and absurdly easy, since having everything at your fingertips saps the enjoyment of foraging and crafting.      The way Don't Starve blends its crafting, exploration, and survival elements makes for an enthralling and unique combination. This game will readily eat up many hours of your time if you let it, but the promise each run holds never seems to pan out thanks to the insidious challenges the game constantly stacks against you. The initial sense of wonder that comes from stumbling upon the surprises and discoveries of this interesting world rapidly fades away when you're stuck tackling the same menial tasks over and over again to regain lost ground for the hundredth time. It's disappointing, because Don't Starve otherwise packs a tremendous amount of charm, depth, and intrigue.    "
4322,Evil Dead: Hail to the King,4.0,0,"Media known for cartoon violence such as horror movies, comic books, and video games are crossbred so frequently that it's quite a surprise it's taken more than ten years for a game based on Sam Raimi's Evil Dead film series to appear in the game world. Instead of turning the events from one or all of the movies into a game, THQ's Evil Dead: Hail to the King picks up where the third film, Army of Darkness, left off. You return to the lone cabin in the woods where the evil spirits broke through into our world, only to be forced back after a series of gory, albeit Three Stooges-like, battles with the film's protagonist Ash (played by Bruce Campbell in the films and voiced by him in the game). The ""Deadites"" have now not only found a way to come back, but they've also kidnapped your girlfriend, made an evil duplicate of you, and possessed the local townsfolk. The only way to stop them is to collect the scattered pages of the book that summoned them and then ""send the evil back.""   Evil Dead: Hail to the King attempts to marry the concepts of the film series with the style of play found in Capcom's Resident Evil games - you view Evil Dead from a variety of fixed camera perspectives, kill monsters with your shotgun and chainsaw, and store away items that you don't have enough room to carry in a mysterious box that magically reappears in several different places throughout the course of the game. The gameplay in Evil Dead differs from Resident Evil in that it favors action over puzzle solving. To its credit, the game provides ample amounts of ammo and health. It's unlikely that you'll have to replay a section of the game more than once to make sure that you have enough bullets and first-aid kits to get through a tough spot, which happens frequently in the Resident Evil series.    Wealth of ammo and health aside, there are so many monsters in Evil Dead that it often feels like you're swimming through them. Deadites well up from the ground in front of you, disappear, and then reappear until you destroy them. Some areas will spawn so many creatures that you'll eventually decide to run away because you've grown bored or annoyed with the whole sequence. Battling multiple foes simultaneously leads to a new set of frustrations. Groups of enemies surround and attack you while you're busy fighting one of them. This would be fine if you possessed a group attack, but you don't, and to make matters worse, a chainsaw can get caught up in the belly of a single creature, leaving you vulnerable to attack from the others. If you try to avoid the monsters, you'll notice even greater problems with Evil Dead. Imagine running down a path and having a Deadite appear in front of you. You move to one side to avoid it, and it knocks you off your feet. You get up and try to keep running past it, only to get stuck on a spot of bad collision detection in the environment. Then another monster appears in front of you. From there, you're stuck having to take on both of them, and it's likely that at least one more creature will appear before you manage to move on to the next screen. Instances like this, as well as the times when you intend to stand and fight for that matter, feel similar to running a marathon through a shopping mall.    Evil Dead's fixed camera angles often defer to cinematic perspectives instead of those that are actually useful in a fight. This means that you'll often find yourself on a path or in a room battling a Deadite and you won't be sure if your attack is lined up correctly (your foes, however, don't seem to have any trouble doing the same). This is a classic example of a graphical problem affecting gameplay, although the visuals do possess a few nice touches outside of that. The game's rendered backgrounds work well to re-create the mood of the Evil Dead films, and they're given some semblance of life through the use of short video loops. These create the illusion of movement such as tree shadows swaying in the wind (although this element is presented more successfully in the Dreamcast version of the game and in Eidos' Fear Effect, for example). Subtler visuals such as the chunks of gore that drip off of Ash's chainsaw after a battle with a Deadite are also worth noting.   Had the battle sequences not been so maddeningly frustrating and frequent, Evil Dead: Hail to the King would at least weigh in as a decent Resident Evil clone, but they work to make the game almost unplayable. The fights even undermine the otherwise decent puzzle-solving elements, since you're required to do a lot of backtracking across areas where Deadites constantly respawn.    If THQ continues to create games based on this license, there's at least hope that the next will turn out better, but this first effort is far from encouraging. It's hard to believe that the survival-horror genre can only be done right by Capcom (and perhaps Konami), but Hail to the King will do little to convince you otherwise."
3039,Mystery Case Files: The Malgrave Incident,7.0,2,"                   The Malgrave Incident can take around 15 hours to complete if you opt to solve each puzzle yourself, and at $30, it's reasonably priced. It's an uneven journey, and it's a shame that its better qualities are offset by periods of aimlessness and frustration. Still, it comes to a satisfying conclusion, and in the end, you'll be glad you took a trip to this mysterious and fascinating island.   "
3680,GT Pro Series,5.0,1,"  It slices, it shoots, it...drives a car? That's right, the Wii Remote can add serving as a steering wheel to its list of uses thanks in part to Ubisoft's racing game GT Pro Series. The concept of using the remote to steer a vehicle is used in other games--and will no doubt be used by many others many more times to come--but what makes GT Pro Series unique is that it takes the concept a step further and turns the Wii Remote into a wheel. Specifically, the game comes packaged with a small plastic steering wheel that has a slot that you can fit the Wii Remote into and then use as you would any other steering wheel to control your onscreen vehicle. It's a novel idea that's fun for a few minutes, but the enjoyment quickly fades, and you're left with an ugly, unexciting racing game.        GT Pro Series is a road racing game featuring real-world vehicles from Japanese manufacturers such as Honda, Subaru, Toyota, and Nissan. It's a very straightforward game of racing on some very generic tracks with broad corners to encourage drifting. It's all very bare-bones stuff that has appeared in countless other racing games. The only interesting element of GT Pro Series is the way you control the car. You hold the Wii Remote so the buttons are facing you, and then you tilt it left and right to steer your car. The included steering wheel casing for the Wii Remote makes it so that you have an actual wheel that you can turn, rather than just tilting the remote. The way the remote is positioned in the wheel, it's easy to reach the 1 and 2 buttons to use your brake and gas, respectively.      The wheel makes it easier to manipulate the remote, but the control isn't very responsive. You have to turn the wheel a full 90 degrees on most corners, and since the game relies a lot on drifting, you usually need to quickly turn the wheel in the opposite direction to right yourself when you're coming out of a turn. This results in a lot of exaggerated back-and-forth turning movements that just aren't much fun after the first lap of a race. It also doesn't help that there's no resistance or feedback, and the whole setup is fairly lightweight. So even though it's fairly easy to control your car, it doesn't ever feel like there's a strong connection between the wheel and the car. There's also a bit of lag in the controls, which is a good thing, because if the remote picked up every little twitch, your car would probably be all over the place. At the same time, this means that the game won't read quick reactions, so if you're trying to avoid an opponent or correct yourself before smashing into a wall, you'll have to start steering much further in advance than you're probably used to.     GT Pro Series compensates for the somewhat loose controls by emphasizing drift cornering typical of arcade-style racing games, rather than the precise, technical style of racing you'd find in a simulation. It's easy to simply tap the brake going into a corner, then turn the wheel and hit the gas to initiate a powerslide that will take you through a turn without diminishing your speed. It can be a bit tricky to control a drift and to know when to steer out of it, but the game is forgiving enough that you should be able to get the hang of it in just a few minutes. Even so, the turn-gas-slide routine gets old quickly, and there isn't much challenge to whipping your car around turns. In fact, aside from when you need to initiate a drift, you can get away without ever touching your brakes in most races.      That isn't to say the races don't get challenging. At first, the computer-controlled opponents are easy to beat, and you probably won't have a hard time taking the gold cup in your first dozen or so race events. Eventually the artificial intelligence does put up more of a fight, but it still feels mechanical. You'll never see opponents leave their lines unless you bump them off course, and as you progress in the game, your opponents will start driving faster, until eventually you have to run a perfect race if you hope to take first place. It also doesn't help that you always start out dead last no matter how you did in the previous race, which means that you'll spend the first half of a lap wading through a mob of 11 other racers until you get in position to make a move on the leader.        GT Pro Series includes the standard race modes like versus, time trial, quick race, and career mode. The career mode includes four circuits, although each one is locked until you complete the previous one. There are several race events in each circuit, with a total of 36 different events in the game. Each event is a series of three races and usually has specific requirements on what type of car you can race. There are events focused on a specific model or type of car, as well as general championship events that let you enter with any vehicle. For each race in an event, you have to place third or better to move on to the next race. Depending on how you place in each race, you're awarded a certain number of points, and the driver with the most points at the end of the three-race event is the winner. By completing events, you'll unlock new cars and tuning options.     There are more than 80 different real-world cars in the game, including familiar models like the Subaru Impreza, Nissan Skyline, Honda Civic, and Toyota Supra. All of the cars have a cel-shaded look, so they aren't as shiny, detailed, or authentic as the vehicle models you'll find in most other contemporary racing games. There's also no damage modeling, so you can smash into walls all day long, but you'd never know it just by looking at your car. Each car handles differently, but none of them handle very realistically. Even the most underpowered or ordinary cars in the game easily drift around corners as if they were high-performance racing machines. You can tune the cars, but your options are limited. As you complete racing events, you'll unlock tuning options like new brakes, exhaust systems, and engines. There are also upgrades in somewhat unusual categories, such as seats, horn, and headlights. There are only a few options in each category, and tweaking them won't make much of a difference, if any, in how your car handles.     In addition to the championship race mode, there's ""drift combo"" mode. In this mode you have to try to rack up as many consecutive drifts as possible. There are three special tracks that are designed so that you can feasibly hold a drift the entire time, just sliding back and forth from one turn to another. It could have been an interesting mode if the driving were fun, but as it is, the drift combo mode gets stale quickly. Other than championship mode and drift combo mode, you can race against up to three of your friends in split-screen races in versus mode. However, bear in mind that there's only one wheel included with the package, so your friends will have to supply their own or simply go without.     There are 10 regular courses in the game, but you can race each one in reverse as well. The courses are as generic as they come, with names like ""green field,"" ""urban circle,"" ""downtown street,"" and ""heights mountain."" The courses have no more character than their names, and after you've been racing for a while, all the tracks seem to blend together. None of them look impressive at all and exhibit bland backgrounds, minimal detail, and downright ugly roadside visual touches like flat, lime-green grass, blurry, jagged barriers, and blocky, undefined structures. It all looks ugly, and the day and night settings and laughable weather effects do nothing to enhance the atmosphere.        The visual presentation in GT Pro Series looks like something from the Nintendo 64 era, and the sound isn't any better. There's some cheesy electronica music that loops in the background and sounds really bad, not only because of the quality of the music, but also because of the poor quality of the recording. The sound effects are equally distorted and lacking. The cars all whine pathetically and don't sound anything like they should, and the sound effects, such as the muted crunch that you'll hear when you hit something and the digitized screech of tires on asphalt, are awful as well.      GT Pro Series makes sense in concept, but in practice it feels like an incredibly generic, cheaply made, stripped-down racing game that has been saddled with a gimmicky control scheme. Once the initial novelty of using the steering wheel subsides, there's nothing much left here to keep you playing. You can play through most of the game's events in six hours or so, and beyond that, all that's left is split-screen multiplayer, which is difficult to get excited about in light of all the issues with the game. So if you're looking for a racing game for the Wii, there are other launch titles that use the same control mechanic with better results. The steering wheel included with this game may be nice, but it's difficult to justify paying full price just to get that piece of plastic.  "
2202,Sid Meier's Civilization V,9.0,2,"    First, here is a quick primer for newcomers. Civilization V, like previous games in the series, is about leading a nation through the eras of history, starting with a single city and expanding across the map. At the outset of any given game, you select a leader (in this case, one of 18, or 19 if you purchased the special edition from Steam), each of whom possesses a particular benefit that disposes his or her civilization to a particular style of play. Americans get a range of sight bonus; the Siamese get diplomatic bonuses with miniature nations new to the series called city-states; the English get naval perks; and so forth. From here, you collect resources; make deals with other civilizations; manage your economy; and go to war and attack the cities of your enemies when the time is right. There are four main ways to win a typically lengthy game of Civilization V. You could dominate through military means and defeat every civilization's capital city. You could be the first to gun through the technology tree and build the parts necessary for a spaceship that whisks you away to Alpha Centauri. You could ally with nations and city-states across the globe and win a diplomatic victory via a vote at the United Nations. Or you might become the cultural envy of the world by developing a large number of government policies and researching a mysterious undertaking known as the Utopia Project. There is also a fifth victory condition: possess the highest score when the turn limit has been reached.         The move to hexagons sets the stage for Civilization V's tactical combat. In the past, you could stack units into one army of doom (or a few armies) that rolled across the map. Now, with the exception of special units (the great general, for example) and workers, units cannot occupy the same space. As a result, you must be extremely conscious of each unit's weaknesses and strengths; a unit's position in regards to both its enemies and other friendly units; and whether or not any terrain bonuses apply. There is a rock-paper-scissors relationship among units that further deepens as units level up and you progress through the eras. When units level up, you choose one of several upgrades for them, such as an attack bonus when attacking from flat terrain. As they level up further, the possibilities expand, which means healing bonuses for the unit, as well as neighboring units, or greater degrees of the same enhancements. Helpfully, you can also choose to fully heal the unit when it levels at the expense of choosing another bonus, which is a mighty handy ability that can save a veteran unit from the jaws of defeat. This excellent new system layers tactical combat onto the strategic map, making battles much tenser--and much less abstract. It also encourages you to keep your veteran units alive. And while it costs you a bit of gold, you can also upgrade units into more powerful iterations (a trebuchet into a cannon, for example) when your research path allows it.      That sounds complex, but it's extremely simple to keep track of battles in Civilization V. When you hover over your intended victim, you get a quick preview of the likely outcome of battle, though a preview won't tell you of other potential consequences. You might win the battle but move into range of a city's defenses or next to a squad of riflemen prepared to defeat you. In fact, similar points could be made about most of Civilization V: It's complex enough to support all of your schemes, but it's easy to interact with it. Veterans who are into micromanagement and like to plan at a snail's pace can manage every worker's actions, select an automated focus for each city's citizens (gold, culture, and so forth), and control each scout's moves hex by hex. But if you'd rather concentrate on the broader aspects of your strategy, you can leave a lot of these actions to the AI, which does a mostly creditable job of doing the right things at the right time.           Another purpose city-states serve is that they get a vote in the United Nations, making them helpful in winning a diplomatic victory if you work especially hard (and spend huge amounts of coin) to cultivate lasting relationships. If you are seeking this method to victory, you might be tempted early in the game to bring a city-state into your fold, but it's a temptation you should avoid. Your relationships with city-states crumble if you don't maintain them, and gold is too precious early in the game to waste your first 250 coins on a friendship that will dissolve within a few turns. In fact, diplomacy can occasionally feel a bit haphazard because of infrequent but noticeable AI oddities. You might request open borders in one turn and be flatly refused--only to have the same civilization propose the same agreement in the next. A weak nation might attack you and refuse your attempts to call for peace, only to sue for peace and gift you with a nice sum of gold and luxury resources a few turns later. As a rule, competing civilizations seem to favor war over harmony, which makes diplomacy feel a bit hollow. Furthermore, the descriptions of other leaders' moods seen in Civ III and Civ IV have been dropped, so you're not always sure of your standing with another civilization.      That isn't to say, however, that diplomacy isn't viable. Focusing on nonmilitary means can still inspire a well-deserved victory. Pushing through eras to win a scientific victory is particularly enjoyable; this is in part due to the well-balanced technology tree, which prevents you from gunning forward willy-nilly from one era to the next. Focusing on technology also has entertainment value, unlocking the game's most powerful future-era unit--the giant death robot. (Nukes are fun; robots are even more fun.) But even if you want cultural or diplomatic victory, you can't ignore the science resource. Structures you need or at the very least should have for other types of victories--the U.N. or the Sydney Opera House, for example--require planning and smart use of the tech tree. But this is the tightly balanced way of the Civilization series: Every action, unit, technology, and structure is tied to everything else. And it's this balancing act, as well as the tweaks and on-the-fly adjustments you need to make, that keeps players so captivated.       You will also be captivated by Civilization V's great looks and serene soundtrack. You may or may not miss Civilization IV's glossy global view, but it's hard not to be drawn in by the newer game's sunny visuals. The great leaders of the world are particularly noteworthy. Montezuma announces his arrival from behind a bright flame while wearing an elaborate green headdress. Wu Zetian's porcelain skin, silky garments, and icy glare are just as memorable. Each leader speaks in his or her native language, which is a wonderful touch. Elsewhere, waves lapping against the shores and exaggerated battle animations give flair to the strategic map; even the fluffy clouds indicating unexplored areas have a certain amount of class to them. The soundtrack is equally classy, made up of a wonderful array of understated orchestral tunes. Musical repetition is all too common in slow-paced strategy games. While tunes certainly repeat in Civilization V, the gorgeous and diverse classical mix here, featuring such composers as Dvorak, Mahler, and Grieg, as well as original music utilizing familiar themes, is unlikely to wear out its welcome.      In fact, Civilization V is not likely to wear out its welcome in general. Random maps, numerous civilizations, and many other options keep the game fresh time after time. If predictable behavior patterns start to bother you (the aggressiveness of the Aztecs, for example), then you can randomize civilization attitudes. If you tire of the early game, then you can start in a later era. Remove barbarians from the map or set a maximum number of turns, if you prefer. And as in Civilization IV, you can adjust the game speed to accommodate marathon sessions or quicker matches. (Though any given game is measured in hours, not minutes.) User-created mods are also likely to be a big part of Civilization V's future, and it's easy to download mods in the game menus. There are already a few available, including a great one that allows you to play on an array of real-world maps.       Multiplayer games are also a possibility for the most patient players. You can set a turn timer to limit how long players get to consider their next move, but even so, the pace is at the whim of those involved, so matches can get bogged down in the early hours. Luckily, most of the customization options available to you in single-player games are available in multiplayer games as well, so you can keep things moving with the right options activated. Gone are hotseat and e-mail play options, with online and local network play as the only ways to play with others. By nature, Civilization V is a game you enjoy most with friends instead of random strangers, though the simple interface makes it easy to find and join available Internet games. Should you want to limit your game to friends, you must invite them through the Steam overlay. (It's too bad there is no button built into the in-game interface for friend invitations, as it would have been a nice user-friendly touch.) Nonetheless, games tend to move smoothly without any notable lag, though we did run into glitches while playing online. At several points, the action button refused to progress to an end turn prompt, forcing us to open a random menu for the match to continue. At other times, switching from the production menu to the production queue caused certain buttons to become unresponsive. (The random-menu fix was effective here as well.)     But those are tiny irritations in a fun and complex game bursting with joy and constant rewards. Sid Meier's Civilization V sucks hour after hour of your day away, giving rise to plans of global conquest and thoughtful tactics. Of course, you could say the same of Civ games of the past, but what makes Civilization V a praiseworthy successor is how it changes up key elements of the franchise. The game's core values--expansion, exploitation, exploration, extermination--are as strong as ever. But the newer tactical combat and addition of city-states give strategy veterans new ways of tackling their goals, while a friendly interface and expansive Civilopedia help newcomers get up to speed relatively quickly. There are a few aspects of Civilization V that could have used a bit more attention, but even as is, this is yet another classic edition to a series that consistently rewards and renovates. If you have even the remotest interest in worldwide domination, you owe it to yourself to get lost in one of the most rewarding turn-based games in years.      "
3323,Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2,5.0,1,"Dragon Ball: Raging Blast kicked off a new series of fighting games set in the popular Dragon Ball universe. But while it admirably captured the look and energy of the Dragon Ball anime, delivering fights filled with stylish attacks and demonstrations of tremendous power, the core fighting action was too shallow and repetitive to make wielding that power much fun. And sadly, Raging Blast 2 does very little to improve upon its predecessor. The visual energy is still there, but Raging Blast 2 doesn't do anything we haven't seen before, making its weaknesses even harder to forgive than they were in the striking but flawed original.        Raging Blast 2 feels more like a modest expansion of the first game than a full-fledged sequel, which makes its $60 price point pretty tough to swallow. It adds 20 characters to the roster, bringing the total to 90, which sure sounds like a lot. But since the differences between one character and the next remain mostly cosmetic, this does nothing to address the shallow gameplay. All the characters handle almost identically and have functionally identical melee attacks and combos. The only real difference is in the super and ultimate attacks they have at their disposal, but these, too, are largely the same for many characters, even if the names and animations associated with them are different. And of the 14 environments in which you can do battle, only four are new for this sequel. The rest are recycled from the original Raging Blast.     Little has changed with regard to the fighting mechanics since the first game. The combatants all soar effortlessly in all directions through large, three-dimensional environments, and the blistering speeds with which they move around make controlling them a pleasure. All the moves are incredibly easy to pull off. Standard melee combos can be dished out with one button, long-range ki blasts can be fired with another, super attacks are performed by pushing the right stick in one direction, and the even more powerful ultimate attacks are done by clicking the right stick. The simplicity of the control scheme makes it easy for anyone to jump in send their opponents flying through the air, through the nearest building or into the nearest mountainside, and it is a kick to fill the screen with the blazing energy of Goku's kamehameha, Tien's tri-beam, and all the other flashy super and ultimate attacks you can so easily perform. But this simplicity also means that the action quickly starts to wear thin. There are a few attacks and defensive maneuvers that require precise timing to pull off, but all of your staple moves are so easy to do that none of it is rewarding in the long run. There's very little nuance to combat in Raging Blast 2, and battles quickly start to feel repetitious and shallow.     The most significant addition to combat is the raging soul system. In the original Raging Blast, melee attacks did so little damage that they were almost pointless, except as a way of building up the ki needed to perform super attacks. Building up ki is still a major component of Raging Blast 2, and it's not uncommon for the action to come to a complete halt as both fighters stand in place, charging up their ki for several seconds before unleashing their next barrages of super attacks at each other. But now, at least there's a way to make melee attacks worthwhile. By charging up your ki to the limit and triggering the raging soul state, you lose the ability to perform super attacks, but your melee strikes become much more powerful. Having a way to make melee strikes a more viable path to victory is a small step in the right direction for the series, but there's still too much emphasis on the slow process of building up ki, and pounding a single button to release strings of melee attacks or holding it down to charge up a strike and send your opponent flying doesn't make for engaging combat.        Raging Blast 2 has a slew of single-player modes, and a decent assortment of multiplayer options as well. In the single-player Galaxy mode, you fight your way through a series of battles associated with the history of each character. This is the closest thing Raging Blast 2 has to a story mode, but it makes no effort to actually tell a story. Unless you already know these characters well, you'll have no clue what their motivations are for punching each other across the universe. The snippets of dialogue that characters utter before each battle certainly aren't enough to flesh out what's going on. Galaxy mode also sets conditions that often make battles far more challenging, but in ways that prove to be more frustrating than rewarding. For instance, you might start with so little health that just a few hits will finish you off, but you have to defeat an opponent who has full health. This is so unfair and the gameplay is so monotonous that defeat becomes a source of crushing discouragement, rather than a hurdle to push yourself to overcome.     There's also a straightforward arcade mode called Battle Zone, a Tutorial mode that introduces you to the basics of combat, and a Training mode in which you can set a variety of options to determine your opponent's behavior and then practice your stuff. Battle and Tournament modes let you battle each other in split-screen; the screen is divided vertically, though, and significantly limits your view of the action. If you jump online, you can participate in ranked or non-ranked single fights or tournaments with other players. Online combat is smooth and responsive, but the combat system makes spamming powerful attacks so effective that even when playing against human opponents, the repetitive fighting quickly grows tiresome.     At least Raging Blast 2 looks good, though the visuals don't improve significantly on last year's game. Still, the characters are vibrant and detailed, and they move with all the blistering speed you'd expect them to possess. The highlight remains the elaborate super attacks, which incorporate close-ups, slow motion, and other techniques to convey the over-the-top energy these characters constantly unleash. Unfortunately, the biggest issue with the presentation of the first game hasn't been addressed here. When your opponent is far above or below you, the camera loses sight of him or her altogether and often shows you nothing but empty ground or empty sky. The sounds of battle are appropriately absurd and exaggerated, and the characters utter their taunts with reliable enthusiasm, but these repetitive outbursts soon become grating.        As a piece of fan service, Raging Blast 2 is packed. There's a remake of a rare Dragon Ball anime included on the disc, and the game rewards you constantly with new pictures, costumes, music, and new special moves, giving diehard Dragon Ball fans an incentive to press on against the monotonous gameplay. But it's just not worth it. When you consider the $60 asking price and how little this game adds to its predecessor, there's no reason for even the most devoted fans to spend their hard-earned money on this hollow cash-in of a sequel.  "
3351,DJ Hero 2,8.0,2,"DJ Hero charted a new course in the rhythm genre by letting you tap, scratch, and crossfade along with uniquely energetic songs, creating what proved to be a very entertaining experience. DJ Hero 2 improves on its predecessor across the board, offering an even better collection of songs, creative new gameplay mechanics, a slick new interface, and expanded online competition. There are even some new ways to play the game, though the ability to be scored on vocal tracks takes a backseat to the excellent Party Play mode that lets you enjoy the music and the game in a relaxed, social environment. Cutting it up with the turntable peripheral is not only more enjoyable but also more affordable with DJ Hero 2, thanks to more-reasonable-than-last-year pricing that lowers the barrier of entry. Though it is still a bit pricey for newcomers, DJ Hero 2 justifies its price tag, not only because the music is so good, but also because the game is so relentlessly fun to play.        The core gameplay of DJ Hero 2 remains largely the same. Using a plastic turntable peripheral, you play along to a song that is a mix of two different tracks. You tap buttons, crossfade between tracks, and hold buttons while moving the platter (the circular platform) to scratch. As you move up the gentle difficulty curve, your actions get more and more closely attuned to the flow of the song. An isolated tap at the beginning of a phrase becomes a series of taps that follow the beat throughout the section, and your crossfading evolves from intermittent slides to bouncing rhythmic bumps that more actively correspond with the mix. DJ Hero 2's setlist is so good that practically every song will have you dancing in your seat. But when your movements are synchronized with the music, you feel like you're helping craft the mix yourself, and you enjoy the experience that much more.     DJ Hero 2 takes this feeling of participation and builds on it, giving you some concrete creative control in certain sections of each mix. Freestyle scratch sections function much like normal scratch sections, only instead of merely moving the platter and triggering prerecorded scratch audio, the music conforms to your actions. You can use short, darting movements to scratch along to the beat or use longer, slower scratches to get a little funkier. These sections are much more engaging than normal scratches because you gain the satisfaction of putting your mark on the mix. Freestyle crossfade sections allow you to be even more creative, giving you control of the balance between the two mixed tracks. Jabbing into one track to create a pulsating beat, bouncing between tracks to highlight certain lyrics, or sticking with one track for all but a few key moments are just some of the ways you can alter these sections to your liking. Of course, your results may not always sound cool, especially if you are trying to keep up with a challenging mix. Fortunately, there are segmented bars in the display that show you good places to cut in and out of a given track. These creative sections heighten the excitement of playing along with a great mix, and the satisfaction you get from scratching out a sweet rhythmic pattern or deftly crossfading at just the right moment is novel and invigorating.     There are a few other gameplay tweaks that enrich the DJ Hero 2 experience, like held notes that are an interesting inversion of the scratch sections and sound samples that are uniquely tailored to each mix. You can also be scored for singing along with the mixes if you have a USB microphone (the guitar mixes from DJ Hero have been cut), but until you know the mix well, it isn't all that fun. Though the singing evaluation doesn't feel as slick as in other games, it works just fine, and it can actually be fun to sing along to mixed-up versions of songs you like once you are familiar with the mix. You can play through all the mixes in Empire mode (read: career mode), which lets you unlock new music and customization options for your in-game DJ. Most sets in Empire mode feature two-to-four songs, some of which are strung together in a cohesive megamix that keeps you playing longer and feels more like a proper DJ set. There are also battles against other DJs, both fictional and real, which test your ability to outperform them in certain sections of a given mix. Deadmau5, Tiesto, and others lend their likenesses and mixes to DJ Hero 2, infusing the game with a more modern club feeling, as opposed to the more hip-hop-oriented DJ Hero.        Playing through Empire mode's themed sets is a fun way to explore the great musical catalog and unlock more songs, thanks in part to the slick and appealing new menu system. You can also play mixes and tailor setlists to your liking in Quickplay or take a more casual approach in Party Play. In this mode, the game simply plays mixes and accompanying videos without stopping. You can jump in with the press of the button, play for as long as you like, and drop out easily. You can enjoy the lively music without imposing the pressure of performance on anyone in particular, making it a great way to introduce the game to a social situation. If you do like a bit of pressure with your performance, then the new online competitive modes are a good outlet. These modes include simple score battles, section-by-section competition, and an intriguing one in which you must tally the longest streak you can. The trick here is that you have to press a button to bank your streak or it won't count. Banking resets your streak counter back to zero, so you have to weigh the risk of striving for a higher streak against the value of banking what you already have. There is also a persistent ranking system that tallies your progress, which is a nice touch that makes you feel like you're earning something for your troubles, even if you don't win the match.      DJ Hero 2 is offered as a stand-alone game this year ($59.99) for those who already have a turntable, though there are a few bundles available, including a game and turntable bundle ($99.99) that is a more reasonably priced point of entry to the series than last year's bundle. The cost to newcomers may seem high, but DJ Hero 2 justifies its price tag. Most of the 83 mixes are a blast to listen to, let alone play, and DJ Hero 2 really brings them to life with gameplay mechanics that create an invigorating connection between you and the music. It lets you enjoy the infectious soundtrack in a wide variety of ways, from casual to challenging, building on the electrifying fun of its predecessor to create one of the most exhilarating experiences available in the world of rhythm games.  "
4702,Arthur and the Invisibles,3.0,0,"  With the PlayStation 2, PC, and Nintendo DS versions of the Arthur and the Invisibles video game tie-in defying the odds by not being half bad, it was only a matter of time before the other shoe dropped. And sure enough, along comes the Game Boy Advance version to set things right in the universe. This questionably coherent take on the movie equates to an abbreviated, chopped-up version of the not-so-shabby PlayStation 2 and PC versions, and its looping level designs and utter lack of challenge prevent it from being anywhere close to an enjoyable game in its own right.        The GBA version of Arthur gives you even less of a plot outline than the Nintendo DS version of the game, which is actually kind of impressive considering how little of a movie tie-in was to be found in that version. Instead of playing out the entire adventure like in the PS2 and PC versions, or going in a completely opposite direction like the DS version, the game starts out by giving you some text that is supposed to provide a little context for your adventuring, and you're then launched into a series of short, disjointed, and extremely easy missions divvied up into three chapters that essentially follow the phases of the film--survive the initial henchmen attack on the Minimoy village, travel through your backyard to Necropolis, wreck Necropolis and flee in a toy car. It's a bit like watching the movie in fast-forward, hitting the play button occasionally just to see where you're at. All told, the 20 missions can be burned through in two to three hours.     As you jump from one scenario to the next, Betameche, being the irritating troll doll that he is, will explain to you each and every time how to jump, move, attack, and so on--not that any of the controls ever change. In fact, nothing here is even remotely challenging or interesting, as most enemies die in one hit and the ones that don't tend to seize up in indecision, trying to figure how to counter the devastating tactic of jumping over them and attacking from behind. Also, for the most part the game is a one-dimensional side-scroller, so there isn't much in the way of exploring, and puzzles are painfully straightforward.     If anything nice can be said about the GBA version of Arthur and the Invisibles, it's that the game tries to present a good amount of variety in the types of missions you'll go on. Nearly every mission has you tackling a different task, whether it be solving environmental puzzles with the standard team, flying on a mosquito as Arthur while you shoot ""tears of death"" at other mosquitoes, or hitting a scrolling series of button sequences. Unfortunately, even though there is variety to the types of missions, there isn't much variety within the actual missions themselves. In fact, levels seem to play out in a continuous loop; you'll come up against the same obstacles laid out in the exact same fashion and enemies waiting for you in the exact same places that you passed just minutes before. And while it's entirely possible that the developers are subliminally urging us to abandon our heathen ways lest we eternally live out a Sisyphean afterlife, it's probably more along the lines of lazy, uninspired level design--or the recognition that a GBA version of this game probably shouldn't have been made. Within these levels, you'll be able to free mul-muls and collect runes, which are used to unlock ""bonus"" content. However, collecting all the mul-muls in any given stage simply lets you play a level you already have access to. And even more worthless, collecting all of the runes decodes a secret message that may as well declare you the king of Zimbabwe, for all the sense it makes or value it imparts.        Arthur's presentation is equally underwhelming. Backgrounds aren't particularly varied or interesting to look at, and the color palette is pretty bland with its ubiquitous earthy tones. Likewise, the audio just loops two or three tunes, and the other sound effects are just good enough to get the job done. Considering that the presentation went a long way in improving the other versions of this game, it's a bit surprising to see the utterly unremarkable quality on display here.     If you enjoyed Arthur and the Invisibles and are looking for more, do yourself a favor and pick up any other version of the game than this one. You'll receive a lot more game for your investment, and perhaps more importantly, you might actually enjoy playing the game you get. Also, it's a rude disservice to fans to price this vastly inferior version at the same point as the other versions--except for the PC version, which is actually $10 cheaper. And if the GBA version is your only option, just go watch the movie three more times, or save your cash for when it comes out on DVD.  "
4094,Pac-Man Pinball,4.0,0,"  Pac-Man Pinball is, as you might imagine, a game of pinball with a Pac-Man theme. To improve your score on the game's single table, you'll collect pellets, or pieces of fruit. Unfortunately, the game's physics are really messed up, and its speed is hugely inconsistent across handsets. On high-end phones, the game might have benefited from a frame limiter, as it runs much too fast.        Physics are paramount in a pinball game, as you're pretty much just playing with angles and the kinetic transference of energy. Pac-Man Pinball's physics are noticeably problematic from the get-go. The ball seems to momentarily adhere to every surface it meets and then propel itself awkwardly from that surface, as if filled halfway with sloshing water.      Pac-Man Pinball's table is split into two sections, and the game's camera alternates between these as necessary. The visuals are in the style of old Pac-Man cabinet marquee art, which is nice. The game features a good collection of sound effects, but no music outside the title screen.      In the end, however, Pac-Man Pinball fails to provide the one thing a virtual pinball game must: accurate ball physics. Furthermore, the game moves too fast to be really playable on certain handsets. Given these shortcomings, Pac-Man Pinball isn't recommendable.  "
3687,Fruit Factory (2004),5.0,1," Fruit Factory is a wholly uninspired puzzler that makes no attempt to either expand on the sokoban mold or deliver a solid game within the conventions of the genre. The game is formulaic to a fault, and too easy to be engaging. An almost unbearably cutesy presentation and some incredibly grating music doesn't help its case, either.      In each level, you must open a door by collecting fruit, croissants, and other such things. This delightful petit déjouner is ill-used by Fruit Factory, which places hackneyed puzzle-game obstacles between you and said repast. These impediments include, but are not limited to, anthropomorphic pigs with Metal Gear-style exclamation points over their heads, puppies walking back and forth, helpfully labeled movable blocks, and unthreatening-looking retracting spikes. Circumnavigating these small hindrances is practically never challenging, however.   Your onscreen avatar throughout this nonsense is an enthusiastic lass who wears her flaxen fibrils in pigtails. She does nothing but trudge resolutely in whichever direction you select. If a movable object lies in her path, she'll push it. Apart from some light puzzle-solving of this sort, you'll mostly be walking toward fruit or away from enemies.   Particularly noteworthy is Fruit Factory's sound, which mostly consists of a disjointed, unmusical MIDI song that will continuously and awkwardly loop in the menu screen, should you let it. This plays at the game's default volume, which can only be described as mind-bendingly loud. In the game, you'll thankfully be spared almost all sound, but that initial din will quite possibly ring in your ears forever, as though a shotgun was discharged directly next to them. Consider yourself forewarned.      Fruit Factory's graphics aren't so offensive; they're just very saccharine. The game's color palette packs more pastels than Toulouse-Lautrec, and by that, we don't mean Fruit Factory is set in smoky barrooms. It's difficult to really consider the threat posed by a rose-pink pig that flaps her arms jauntily at you, beaming all the while. She seems the good-natured sort of sow who might well appear in an Easter display or in an early morning cartoon show. For what it's worth, the graphics are bright and colorful.   There's really not much reason to play Fruit Factory, since it follows in the footsteps of so many similar, better games. Maybe a young child would enjoy the ego-stroking of repeatedly beating the game's simplistic stages, but it's hard to imagine most players having much fun here. "
171,Cult of the Lamb,9.0,2,"Cult of the Lamb begins at our poor, titular lamb's end. After walking down a narrow stone corridor, you are greeted by robed cultists and The Old Gods: four monstrous beings to whom the inhabitants of this strange land are (mostly) loyal. As it turns out, this little lamb is the last of its kind, having managed to evade death while the rest of its fluffy friends were culled. The Old Gods reveal this was due to a prophecy that a lamb would be the one who would lead to their undoing, destroying the Old Faith and unleashing the one thing they fear most: The One Who Waits. The Gods instruct their followers to dispatch you quickly, but little do they know this is precisely what the prophecy demands.Upon being killed, you meet with The One Who Waits, an all-powerful god who we learn was betrayed and imprisoned by the other four. After your meeting, he makes you an offer: start a cult in his name, and he will both bring you back to life and gift unto you his former powers via the Red Crown. After you accept, you are sent back to the world of the living, where you meet with The One Who Waits' former cult leader, Ratau, who leads you to the site of your up-and-coming commune. From this point, the game divides into two main sections: exploring dungeons and managing your cult, both of which are closely tied to one another.There are four main dungeons in Cult of the Lamb, and each of these domains is led by one of the Old Gods. Each also contains features, resources, blueprints, follower forms, and enemies unique to that area. The dungeons are composed of a series of randomly-generated location types arranged on a webbed map, allowing you to evaluate their icons and choose the path you wish to follow. The most common types are combat areas, which are denoted on your map by a sword icon. Each of these areas is made up of a handful of randomly-generated rooms, occupied by monsters or, if you're lucky, a mysterious figure weidling tarot cards that grant you various boons. Other types of areas include ones filled with resources for your commune, shops, a character issuing you special challenges--such as ""don't take damage in the next three rooms""--story beats, malevolent pentagram chambers, and new followers.Your main objective while exploring these dungeons is to reach the end four times--slaying a different mini-boss each time you accomplish the feat--and then ultimately facing off against one of the four Old Gods. Upon finishing them off, all enemy units grow stronger, a new boss enters the final area, and you gain the ability to venture out repeatedly instead of having to return to your cult after each expedition--adding some major replayability and giving you the chance to grind a bit when later areas prove challenging.While Cult of the Lamb has a fair amount of options that make it more approachable, it is inherently a fast-paced and challenging game. Though enemies tend to have predictable move sets you can pick up on fairly quickly, rooms can quickly become over-crowded thanks to additional monsters spawning and all the various long-range attacks more elite units will throw your way. Dodging is vital to staying alive, and if you're playing on PC, I highly recommend assigning it to a button on your mouse--unless you want your space bar to also be a sacrificial lamb as well.Not only that, but like most roguelikes, a great deal of the game is dictated by chance. You have no choice in what weapon and curse--a special attack fueled by fervor you collect from killing enemies--you begin each expedition with. While swords and axes might offer pretty standard speeds and attack rates, daggers are considerably weaker but attacks are quicker and battle-hammers are so slow you have to click twice to use them--though they do pack a big punch. This randomization is a big factor in what can be some broad difficulty swings, but it also creates a lot of rewarding moments when you overcome the drawbacks you can face.I finished my first playthrough of Cult of the Lamb on normal and was faced with a bit of resistance toward the end of the second area, which ultimately pushed me to be more thoughtful and patient going forward. However, there are a few instances where you might bump into difficulty spikes and have a hard time accumulating resources, leading to skill stagnation and, as a result, difficulties on expeditions. Course-correcting isn't too painful--I began to revisit dungeons and go to resource-filled rooms rather than ones filled with enemies or followers--but these moments can be frustrating.In addition to normal mode, I tried the game on both easy and hard modes to get a feel for what the differences were. I was happy to find that, mechanically, everything stays essentially the same regardless of what difficulty you are at (though admittedly I didn't test out the fourth and most challenging difficulty). What is impacted by difficulty is the size of enemy health bars and the resources you are given, which makes it rewarding to play on a lower difficulty in order to learn the ropes and improve before ramping it up. If you do find the game getting easier for you--or are feeling overly challenged and need a breather--you can change the difficulty back and forth at will.Also included in the options you can quickly adjust are a few helpful accessibility settings. In the game's menu, you can reduce camera motion, screenshake sensitivity, and the dithering fade distance--all of which can help those who might have motion sickness or particular visual impairments. You can also scale the text larger and turn off animated text, making the game more legible. Last but certainly not least, you can toggle flashing lights off, which is a great feature for those who might have epilepsy or any sort of light sensitivity.While a substantial portion of the game takes place inside of dungeons, equally as important are the grassy plains you call home. It is here you are tasked with creating a little slice of paradise for the woodland creatures who call you their leader. This includes ensuring they have places to sleep, food to eat, and, uh, a sanitary environment. While you might be on the top of the social hierarchy, let's just say it doesn't quite feel that way when you are serving your cultists meals and scooping up piles of bodily fluids. Regardless, once their basic needs are met, your followers will happily work for you, gathering wood and stone as well as generating devotion, which in turn helps you upgrade and decorate your compound.Also incredibly important to your cult's success is their overall faith in you. Your faith meter is impacted by how victorious you are on your expeditions as well as how you treat your followers. Interrupting your followers while they are having discussion with one another can cost you a few faith points, whereas conducting a ritual in your temple involving animal sacrifice might cause mass panic and disdain. This forces you to find a balance between keeping your cultists happy and indulging in selfish acts that increase your strength. If your faith drops too low, your less loyal followers might start to dissent, sowing seeds of doubt and chaos throughout the cult. You can stave off a potential coup by attempting to re-educate dissenting followers, but this is a slow process. You also have the option to imprison them or even take 'em out back and finish them off, though the latter might lead to even more discontent.Now, you might be wondering what just about every character in this game is wondering at any given time right now, ""okay, sure I want my cult to thrive, but what's in it for me?"" The most important building in your commune is your temple, which is where you can acquire all the upgrades that will help you on your expeditions. If your cult isn't happy, you won't be too happy either as the game progresses. At your temple, you can conduct daily sermons that fill up a meter, ultimately unlocking permanent dungeon upgrades. These include things like increased attack, starting off with higher-level weapons and curses, and receiving new types of weapons, such as ones laced with poison or that resurrect the enemies you kill as vengeful spirits keen on helping you.In addition to giving sermons, you can use the temple atlar to declare doctrines, change a few key pieces of your build, and conduct rituals. Declaring doctrines is where you see the greatest amount of player choice in the game, as you can decide whether you'd prefer to be loved or feared by your followers. There are five categories of doctrines you can choose from, each with four guiding questions that shape how your cult functions. For example, one of these categories is life and death, and poses queries about how you wish for your followers to view dying. You can choose to place importance on burials, or take a more economical stance and turn bodies into fertilizer.Interestingly enough, the game actually gives you a lot of room to exert some level of benevolence. Sure, you might be a violent, pseudo-dictator at the head of a budding theocracy, but you have a fair bit of control over how you treat the people who follow you. If you have no desire to sacrifice your cultists to the tentacled being that lies below or to use them for personal gain, you don't have to. You can assure your followers there is life after death, help them ascend to heaven, ensure they eat and sleep well, and even give them days of rest. Best of all, it never feels as if you are punished or placed at a disadvantage for playing this way. As a person who struggles with selecting the ""renegade"" option in any game, it was refreshing to see that either playstyle was completely viable and being grotesquely power-hungry didn't necessarily equate to being grotesquely powerful.Beyond the stretches of your compound are a few other special locations, with both a dice and fishing mini-game tucked away in them. Despite how many pieces and systems there are in Cult of the Lamb, they come together in complete cohesion. Not once did I feel overwhelmed by all its moving parts, nor did I ever feel like what I was doing was repetitive. Every mechanic, skill tree, and system comes together to harmonize with the resource collection, management, and combat aspects of the game.Also working in harmony is the game's art direction and dark-yet-playful tone. The woodland creatures that make up Cult of the Lamb's cast of characters resemble Saturday morning cartoon characters, albeit with ritualistic markings adorning their cute and cuddly forms. The game uses color masterfully, with certain palettes designated to certain areas yet remaining rich and vibrant throughout the game. Your commune and neighboring areas, for instance, tend to use more naturally occurring colors, while locations associated with the occult favor deep reds and mystic purples. Adding to the supernatural element of the game is how its animations almost breathe, pulsing, strobing, and dithering with your gameplay, adding an almost haptic sensation. The upbeat-yet-unnerving music is sickly sweet and creates a distinct contrast between the cute visuals and the undercurrent of impending doom--the appropriate vibe for a cult. These jaunty tracks are successful in blending into the background--which is incredibly important in titles with inherently repetitive gameplay--while also being memorable and suiting the overall tone perfectly.Lastly, while a plethora of recent games might have more poignant things to say about death, Cult of the Lamb offers a fun and more light-hearted take on the subject, leaning more into chaotic nihilism. The bulk of its focus is instead on the acquisition and transfer of power--as well as how easy it is to lose it. Naturally, these themes take the game into some dark places, but it manages to do so without ever feeling like it's trying too hard to be edgy.All of these elements come together to solidify Cult of the Lamb as a standout title in both the roguelike and simulation genres, as well as a one-of-a-kind entry that exists in the middle of them. Whether you are exploring the dungeons or expanding your cult, the experience is enjoyable, challenging, and more than a bit demented. With how surprisingly dense each of these parts are, the fact that all the pieces come together as smoothly as they do is a triumph."
234,GhostWire: Tokyo,8.0,2,"Tango Gameworks' The Evil Within and its sequel are quintessential Shinji Mikami games, brazenly following in the footsteps of Resident Evil 4 by mixing survival horror and action with an over-the-shoulder perspective. The studio was never meant to be an avenue for Mikami's own creative vision, though. Tango was established with the aim of showcasing new and talented young creators, and Ghostwire: Tokyo is the first game to really demonstrate this aspiration. There's nothing else that can compare to its peculiar brand of open-world exploration and supernatural combat, as it borrows familiar elements and combines them with new ideas in imaginative and surprising ways. It may stumble at times, but the sheer creativity and attention to detail exhibited throughout constantly shine through.Ghostwire: Tokyo's story begins at a rapid pace with one of its protagonists lying dead on the floor. After being involved in a fatal car accident on Tokyo's famous Shibuya Scramble Crossing, Akito Izuki is brought back from the dead when a shadowy spirit calling himself KK merges with his body. The unholy union between the pair gives Akito access to KK's supernatural powers, but before he's even able to fathom what the hell's going on, the rest of Tokyo's residents are engulfed by a malevolent fog that blankets the entire city. A menagerie of evil spirits known as Visitors now roam Shibuya's streets in their stead, so it's up to Akito and KK to put a stop to the masked villain responsible before the situation worsens.Both protagonists have different motivations for embarking on this dangerous quest, beyond their responsibility to save the world. KK is seeking revenge while Akito is desperate to save his younger sister after she's kidnapped by the villain for nefarious purposes. The connection between Akito and KK is the strongest aspect of Ghostwire: Tokyo's narrative, as their budding relationship takes center stage and develops naturally over the course of the game. The incidental banter between the pair adds levity to what is oftentimes bleak subject matter, and it's easy to become invested in their predicament even when the mysteries surrounding KK's past are ultimately unfulfilling.The rest of the cast isn't given enough screentime to really stand out or cultivate any kind of attachment, so attempts to land an emotional payoff are stunted. Akito's sister, Mari, is a prime example of this as she's more of a plot device than an actual character. The villain is severely underutilized, too. His motives make him potentially sympathetic, but instead he's one-note and completely forgettable as a result.The story's shortcomings are disappointing considering the early potential of its alluring mysteries, but even this isn't enough to detract from Ghostwire: Tokyo's fantastic combat, setting, and world-building. When KK entwined with his body, Akito gained access to supernatural powers known as Ethereal Weaving, granting him the ability to unleash projectiles from his fingertips. Ghostwire: Tokyo forgoes physical firearms--instead, Akito is constantly contorting his hands and performing the finger gymnastics required to conjure spectral powers. You start the game with access to Wind Weaving, allowing you to pelt Tokyo's invading spirits with neon gusts of wind, but by the end of the second chapter, you'll also add both Fire and Water Weaving to your repertoire. The former unleashes a destructive missile that deals heavy damage, while the latter's horizontal burst and wide spread make it an obvious shotgun analog. Each flick of the finger discharges these soaring projectiles that collide with a palpable ferocity, sending vibrant particles scattering into the night sky.[Ghostwire: Tokyo's] sheer creativity and attention to detail exhibited throughout constantly shine throughCombat takes a while to find its stride and feels stilted for the game's first couple of hours, mainly because the fire rate of Wind Weaving is painstakingly slow. Once you start delving into Akito's skill tree, however, this gradually begins to change. Increasing the rate of fire does wonders to the sense of impact and satisfaction that comes from rapidly blasting enemies away, and the combat's dynamism only continues to grow once you unlock more powers. You'll start utilizing Water Weaving in close-quarters to pulverize multiple enemies at once, propel Fire Weaving's flaming area-of-effect attack to damage some of the game's toughest foes, and throw magic Talismans to lock Visitors in place.A significant reason why combat feels so gratifying is because of the way enemies react to your attacks. You might be fighting apparitions that have some basis in Japanese folklore, but you're constantly ripping off these digital chunks to reach the inner core festering below the surface. All of the enemy designs feel like a reflection of Tokyo and its people, meshing modernity with the past. Just as towering skyscrapers cast shadows over traditional Shinto shrines, so too do these evil spirits emerge from contemporary issues. The faceless, umbrella-wielding Visitors are born from the hearts of those pushed to exhaustion by their work, while the headless spirits scurrying around the city in school uniform are derived from the anxieties of students.Ghostwire: Tokyo isn't a particularly scary game, despite these descriptions, yet the atmosphere it conjures is unmistakably eerie. An empty city is always going to be inherently unnerving, but that's especially true of one as populated and dense as Tokyo. This isn't your typical post-apocalyptic metropolis either, as Shibuya's denizens have only recently vanished. There are still signs of life everywhere you look, with music emanating from the innards of karaoke bars; LED billboards illuminating the rain-soaked urban sprawl; convenience stores welcoming your patronage with a merry jingle and shelves stacked with freshly wrapped onigiri; and discarded clothes, shoes, umbrellas, and phones strewn across the floor, left behind by those consumed in the fog.One glance at the map is enough to incur the dread of open-world fatigue, yet the majority of the myriad icons simply represent shops you can visit to purchase healing items. Exploration never feels overwhelming, mainly because you gain access to sections of the city in bite-sized chunks. By cleansing corrupted Torii gates throughout Shibuya, you'll gradually disperse the harmful fog and reveal new side missions and collectibles. These optional quests are concise vignettes that usually revolve around helping spirits that are trapped in a state of limbo. This might include recovering cursed objects that were sold by a secondhand shop, searching an otherwise quiet neighborhood for the source of ominous piano music, or investigating a construction site where a rash of mysterious deaths has occurred.You can typically complete these side missions in a few minutes, and their quality fluctuates wildly from one to the next. At their best, you'll unravel a compelling paranormal mystery that mixes combat and exploration; at their worst, you'll be thrown into a bland arena battle or have to tail a yokai for what feels like an eternity. These side missions are never outright bad, and they typically shed light on a particular facet of Japanese folklore, but too many of them lack depth and feel like they were included just to pad out the open-world activities.Finding out that a Nurikabe is essentially a big mattress that enjoys impeding pathways, or that a Kappa can't resist a good cucumber, is a part of what makes exploring Ghostwire: Tokyo's open-world such a joy. It has an irreverent charm that pops up from time to time. You can pet, feed, and read the thoughts of dogs, for example, and spiritual cats now run all of the city's convenience stores because they need to earn enough money to purchase nether catnip. You'll also use what's known as a Katashiro to consume friendly spirits and then feed them into a magic payphone to save them in exchange for money and XP. And it all makes complete sense because Tango Gameworks has established such a tangible sense of place.Ghostwire: Tokyo doesn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to open-world games, but its unique setting, tremendous attention to detail, and singular combat make it stand out amongst its contemporaries. The story stumbles and not all of the side missions are particularly engaging, yet these aspects are easy to push to the back of your mind when you're using finger guns to tear through corrupted spirits with dazzling aplomb. Shinji Mikami is a legendary director, but taking a backseat and letting new voices come to the fore has paid off."
3708,Curse of Atlantis: Thorgal's Quest,5.0,1," DreamCatcher Games' new graphical adventure game, Curse of Atlantis: Thorgal's Quest, begins when the protagonist, a Viking stranded and shipwrecked at a small island village, is shown a vision in which he kills his own son. This is not a vision of the future, he is told, but of a possible future. While it would seem that the child is safe--the killer, after all, is stranded--Thorgal is immediately determined to escape the island and rush to his son's aid.      With this illogical decision, Thorgal's Quest begins. The game is related to the bizarre series of Atlantis games only in name. Like those games, however, it is yet another European adventure game imported to the US by The Adventure Company, and once again the decision is questionable. At the outset, Thorgal's Quest seems refreshing; it appears to be a traditional third-person adventure game of the type that has become increasingly rare. You guide your character around with your mouse, clicking on things, talking to characters, and solving simple inventory puzzles.    But after a few hours of playing, any hopes you might have had for the game being even a generic adventure will be dashed. Not just because of the puzzles or the strange story, but because the game will be over. Thorgal's Quest is less of a quest and more of a short jaunt, since most players will be able to finish it in a single sitting.    If the substance of those few hours were better, the short length of the game wouldn't be such a problem. However, Thorgal's Quest doesn't offer much in the way of puzzles. The game has a few inventory-based puzzles, one of which involves getting over a chasm with some boards--a fairly clever one, if a bit easy. Some of the game's other notable puzzles include a three-dimensional version of a slider puzzle, and a game called ""Runes"" that you play against Death incarnate. This last puzzle is the best part of Thorgal's Quest; it's a fun and simple strategy game that involves using tiles to occupy spaces on a board. If Runes had been included as a minigame that could be accessed at any time (rather than only at a specific point), the game, as a whole, would be a much better value.    The majority of the other puzzles are incredibly simple inventory puzzles (mostly requiring you to give someone something they've asked for), but there are a few action puzzles as well. Occasionally, someone will attack you. Though Thorgal is supposed to be a capable archer, these action sequences never involve killing someone outright. Instead, there is always a trick to the combat, but finding the trick never amounts to more than moving your cursor across the screen until it changes to a target icon, though there are three action puzzles that require a bit more skill, since they require you to hit a moving or spinning target. The variety of puzzles is noteworthy, but only a few are very inspired.   The inspiration for the game itself comes from a series of European graphic novels. However, the source material doesn't inform the game's design in any noticeable way, apart from the black-and-white sketches that appear in the game's loading screens and in a single cutscene. Aside from these, the game looks fairly typical and uses three-dimensional characters on two-dimensional backdrops that are bland and generic. The voices for the characters are passable, though the actors overenunciate words to make them sound more dramatic. However, the sound quality on the voice recordings is awful; Thorgal sounds as though he's speaking into an aluminum can for the majority of the game.      What he says doesn't make much sense, either. The story of Thorgal's Quest is bizarre, as the title might imply--though be warned that the following description contains plot spoilers. The story doesn't seem to have much to do with Atlantis at all, instead involving Norse gods and, eventually, spaceships. When Thorgal is informed that he is descended from a race from beyond the stars, he doesn't seem at all shocked. Nor is this Viking at all astounded when he finds himself onboard a spaceship fighting a laser-spewing robot. Perhaps Thorgal's lineage is a well-known fact in the graphic novel, but in the game inspired by it, it just seems strange.    The game's one genuinely interesting moment comes at the end, when Thorgal learns what the vision actually showed him. It isn't an amazing plot twist, but it's more interesting than anything that comes before it. But again, that end comes all too soon. If it had given you a bit more to do, the game would be a simple and somewhat straightforward adventure game, but as it is, it's simply too short. To its credit, the game is budget-priced, so serious adventure game fans--the kind who like adventure games no matter how generic they might be--may find the short length to be less of a problem. Otherwise Thorgal's Quest seems like a demo for a bigger, if not necessarily better, game.  "
4106,Missile Command (1980),4.0,0,"  Missile Command on the Xbox 360 serves as a clear example of how not to do a remake. With its inaccurate emulation of the original game and a completely lifeless ""evolved"" version of the game mashed together in the same package, it manages to disappoint on all fronts.     The core game is the same in both versions. You move a cursor around the screen and attempt to shoot down incoming missiles before they can hit your cities or missile bases at the bottom of the screen. The missiles occasionally split into multiple warheads. You'll also have to deal with flying craft that cruise by and launch more missiles, as well as smart bombs that change direction to dodge your fire. Your missiles come from three different launch bases, and you have a button for each base.        In the original version of the game, you have to use a little strategy to determine from which base to launch. Your shots have some travel time, so you'll usually want to fire from your closest base. But your center base also launches much faster than the side bases, so that's one more thing to consider. But travel time doesn't appear to be a factor in the ""evolved"" version of the game, which makes the concept of multiple bases feel totally meaningless. Instead, a bolt of lightning appears between the missile base and the explosion caused by your shot. The new version feels like someone sat down and wrote out a document explaining what Missile Command was then handed it to someone who had never even seen the original game for programming. It's a soulless version of the game that has none of the original game's feel; instead it feels more like some lame free PC download, complete with the same sort of generic techno music track you'd expect to find in something so slapdash.     To add insult to injury, the original mode doesn't play especially well either. The arcade version of the game operates with a track ball, which makes your cursor movement feel sort of like a mouse. The Xbox 360 analog stick isn't up to the challenge, and the faster later levels of the game are much, much harder as a result. On top of that, the sound effects aren't accurate when compared to the arcade original either.     The 400 points Atari is asking for Missile Command gets you two versions of an arcade classic, but with both versions as problematic as they are, it's hard to find a reason to pay up for them. Aside from some passable graphical effects in the evolved version, there's not too much here worth seeing.  "
3737,King Arthur (2004),5.0,1," There's nothing inherently wrong with either licensed games or derivative beat-'em-ups. Some of the finest games on cell phones--including classics like Nightmare Creatures and Hulk the Mobile--have successfully recycled gameplay from Final Fight, and there have been a number of interesting movie-licensed titles as well. That said, game developers adopt many additional risks when taking on licensed products, and the temptation to skate on title alone at the sacrifice of gameplay always looms large. Unfortunately, Lavastorm's King Arthur fails to impress from either an originality or gameplay standpoint. Its beat-'em-up gameplay has been oversimplified to the point of tedium, and the Saxon-filled levels are too fundamentally uninvolving to provide much entertainment value.       In King Arthur, you play as the vainglorious swordsman Lancelot. In this role, you wander the countryside battling Saxons and other baddies from the eponymous film. The controls and gameplay are exceedingly simple. In a 2D environment, you move up, down, left, and right across the screen. If you try to move into an opponent, you whack him with your sword. Crates scattered about the battlefield hold various, temporary power-ups and the occasional healing potion. Sometimes, your foes leave these items behind. Other times, they drop vials of poison that sap your health. As you work through the game, you occasionally must battle bosses who are, in essence, bigger versions of the bad guys you previously defeated, except with lame special attacks, such as the ability to charge across the screen and hit you.   The game's strategy is as cut down as its controls. The only time you are in any sort of danger is when enemies manage to attack you from two directions. By keeping to the edge of the screen, you can cut off any flanking attacks before they place you in danger. Many times, your foes are content to dance back and forth without making any effort to attack you from behind or even from the front. Since you can only attack to the right or left, not up or down (though you can move in those directions) you only have to watch those directions. You can let a foe stand below you all day long--he can't touch you.   Oddly enough, you can make special attacks by rapidly pushing in a foe's direction, but in most cases the special attacks are slow, unwieldy, and serve as a perfect opportunity for an opponent to clobber you.   King Arthur's graphics are pretty run-of-the-mill. Your character is rendered in dark blues, and the backgrounds are simple to the point of being dull. The enemies have basic character designs that, in some cases, provide too little detail. For example, the level one opponents might be trolls, dwarves, or barbarians.   Overall, King Arthur is a rather banal, lackluster walk through the beat-'em-ups of yesteryear. The boss fights feel very predictable, and for most of the levels, your best strategy is to stand in a corner using your basic attack to slowly beat an opponent senseless, while his allies wait their turn. If you're expecting more than a cursory play out of King Arthur, you'll be disappointed. "
270,Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition,4.0,0,"There is a strong argument to be made that Grand Theft Auto III, Vice City, and San Andreas are the three most influential games of the 21st century. You can see their DNA floating around just about every open-world title made since and pretty much anyone making in-engine cutscenes owes a debt to Rockstar going fully Hollywood early on. There is an entire generation whose only exposure to various genres of music come from the soundtracks of these three games. Naturally, parts of them have aged better than others, but in the context of the early-to-mid 2000s, these games broke serious ground.These are all facts set in stone by this point, of course. But it's worth seeing it all written down one more time so it's abundantly clear just how utterly bewildering it is that Rockstar let GTA III, Vice City, and San Andreas get as absolutely mangled as they have been with these so-called Definitive Editions. Somehow, the studio that was so meticulous about making sure the poop leaving the back end of a horse was as lovingly rendered as a cowboy's sickly, grizzled face has approved a remaster bearing its name that turns its most iconic games into app store shovelware.That isn't hyperbole, either. Having played virtually every major version of these games in some form over the years, it's glaringly obvious these remasters were built on the bones of the already-disfigured mobile ports of each game. As weak as those were, there were certain things you can forgive just by nature of the platform. Rampant bugs, stripped-down animations, frame rate instability? These are the prices you pay for portability. Those excuses vanish into thin air with the Definitive Editions having all the horsepower of current-gen consoles and PCs to utilize. Now, all the problems of the mobile ports have been blown up to 4K resolution. Now, the neglect feels less like a bug and more like a feature.It's worth pointing out that all three games do have a few welcome quality-of-life improvements. Load times are virtually gone and GTA III finally has a large-scale map in the menus. All three games get not just autosaves, but checkpoints, allowing you to retry failed missions without a trip to the hospital. GTA V's weapon wheel has been grafted onto all three games, along with its control scheme, which is probably the greatest blessing here. The original PS2/Xbox versions of these games are all pretty draconian when it comes to current standards, and even the otherwise excellent original PC ports had problems with controller mapping feeling graceful, no matter how many times you tinker. Bringing the games up to modern standards makes jumping right in and going to work so much easier. Definitive or not, if these releases simply featured these little refinements and a 4K bump in resolution, they'd still come across as dated, but appreciable and largely faithful to the original experience. Unfortunately, that's not the case.Like most remasters, Rockstar--by way of developer Grove Street Games--has also updated the visuals using modern tools of the trade. On paper, Rockstar did everything right. The resolution has been raised to 4K, jaggies have been smoothed over, characters and NPCs have been given new or updated facial models, a dynamic lighting system has been added, foliage has been completely redone, better reflections have been introduced. These are all positives--on paper. In execution, however, it's essentially plastic surgery with a chainsaw. All of these improvements have been thrown at these games, at the expense of demolishing the original mood, or the humanity of these characters, or the personality of the massive cities they inhabit. These remasters are a crash course in the importance of art direction.The greatest disservice done to the trilogy has to do with characters' faces. To be fair, none of the previous versions of the game were exactly The Last of Us when it comes to expressive or photorealistic faces, but even on the lowly PS2, they were faces with character. You can get the gist of Tommy Vercetti as a middle-aged ex-con sent to Vice City as an afterthought, and the ever-growing frustration on his face the longer he spends time there. It's a face with five o'clock shadow and extremely New Yawk eyebrows, suitable for Ray Liotta's still-incredible voice performance. The Tommy Vercetti of the Definitive Edition is a glassy-eyed cartoon, a featureless face with a pompadour--a no-frills Fortnite character. The same mostly goes for GTA III's new, eerie, fetus-faced Claude. CJ in San Andreas fares best, but that averages out with an initial body that looks like the Slender Man. That also goes for the rest of the NPCs, ranging from Saturday morning cartoon caricatures like Officer Tenpenny and Ryder--somewhere, Eazy-E is rolling in his grave--to featureless, amorphous horrors like the now disgustingly lumpy Big Smoke and Kendl. Somehow, these are characters meant to carry hours' worth of story, and their only saving grace is that the lighting system has been so haphazardly implemented, so calamitous to the cinematic feeling of the original games, that even the sun at high noon can't light Black characters properly enough to get clear looks at their faces.Most of the environmental improvements follow that same ethos of features implemented, but not thoughtfully. There are scattered parts of each game that manage to be reasonably impressive--the inside of Diaz's mansion, Ken Rosenberg's office, Bedford Point in GTA III, and the forests of San Andreas, to name a few--but with the additional graphical horsepower at the game's disposal, the new visuals fail at being evocative. Everything still feels like broad, flat polygons with higher resolution assets plastered over them. These Definitive Editions are actually missing things compared to previous versions, too. The ports on the original Xbox did the work of reanimating hands so everyone doesn't look like they're holding giant immovable donuts. The old PC ports gave players their own personal stereo to bump their own tunes through the in-game radio. The original ports also had co-op Rampage modes. None of these have made the jump, along with about 40 songs from the radio stations, and all of that would have been welcome here. Then there are the ""enhancements"" that make the games demonstrably worse. Just about any text not tied to the user interface (e.g. billboards, storefront windows, street signs) seems to have been rendered by AI with no human input. The result is that any stylized text from the original versions of these games has a strong chance of not just random, distracting misspellings or orientation, but completely different and laughably oversimplified fonts. My favorite case in point is the gate leading to Chinatown in GTA III, which displays as blurry but obviously stylized cursive on PS2, but the AI responsible for reinterpreting the landscape has spat back out at as lowercase Comic Sans.Rain, in particular, isn't rendered with any sort of subtlety or natural progression, or opacity. It also turns on and off at random, and comes down in such battering torrents it actually renders the games virtually unplayable until it stops. Meanwhile, on the flipside, the haze and fog that made driving through San Andreas at night such a cool, creepy experience has been completely removed.The icing on top is the game being riddled with just good old-fashioned bugs. Some of these, in fairness, were present in the original games--moments of wacky vehicle physics, characters able to clip through walls or getting stuck on random objects--though it's not out-of-pocket to wonder why the opportunity wasn't taken to correct them if you're aiming for ""definitive."" Some of the bugs, however, are brand-spanking-new exclusives to these versions, like vanishing cars, empty/unfinished portions of the maps, cops who don't react to their cars being hit, and minigames rendered utterly broken thanks to the fact that the games are built on top of the simplified touchscreen-reliant mobile versions.Are these Definitive Editions unplayable? Unless it's raining, no. All three games still have their merits. Even GTA III, which has increasingly looked like a relic with time, has become more of an interesting missing link between the top-down chaos of the original games and the sprawling amoral crime dramas that would follow. Vice City is still every ounce the perfect marriage of Miami Vice and Scarface, and one need not look much further than the actual Scarface game we got to see just how hard it is to make these elements work in harmony. San Andreas is still the best of the bunch, arguably the best game in the series. Even while it ups the ante on how much control you have over their character's physical development, and how much explosive chaos you can get up to, it's one of the few games altogether to not just portray Black life, even in these broad strokes, but eventually put its protagonist in an underexplored territory of being too bougie for poor folks, and too hood to hang with the rich folks. The casual misogyny and homophobia peppered throughout, which remain unchanged here, has probably dated these games more than the gameplay."
170,Marvel's Spider-Man,9.0,2,"You can't go past Spider-Man's best stories without a good duality--the awkwardness of Peter Parker versus the confidence of his alter ego, the relatable humanity of his adversaries versus their heinous deeds, and the age-old ditty about juggling power and responsibility. Insomniac's take on Spider-Man juggles dualism too, not just in its narrative themes but its mechanical execution. Intense boss fights are balanced with leisurely exploration. You'll make the most of Spidey's acrobatic abilities in the open world, but also the mundane abilities of his less super-powered allies in linear stages. Dualities usually suggest there's a poorer trait, but they're often integral in characterizing the whole. That's Insomniac's Spider-Man--it's a fantastic experience that completely absorbs you into its unique slice of the Marvel universe, and while that's partly defined by a slew of menial tasks, it becomes easy to forgive, because they're part of what helps complete the fantasy of becoming a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.It's obvious to point out that a lot of the ideas in Marvel's Spider-Man have already appeared in a number of existing video game interpretations of the character--surely one of the pitfalls of revisiting something so perennially popular. But where Insomniac's version elevates itself, and where it makes an immediate impact, is in the slick presentation that neatly wraps major parts of the experience. It's obvious that the last decade of Marvel Cinematic Universe releases has had an effect here--its photorealistic slant shies away from any overt association to comic books. Bright, saturated colors and stirring orchestral hooks are ever-present, and sweeping angles with camera effects majestically frame Spidey's signature combat style and acrobatics around the city, emphasizing them as the hyperreal feats they are.But it's the story that has benefited from Marvel's popular cinematic formula the most. Insomniac's interpretation spends a lot of time focusing on the human side of the tale, and Marvel's Spider-Man features some solid understated performances. Peter Parker is an experienced Spidey, but still suitably dorky, and his relationships with the important people in his life have a major role to play. The game spends ample time dwelling on supporting characters, a move which aids later narrative developments in producing more effective impacts.There's always an interesting dynamic with superhero stories--you'll likely be able to accurately predict the fates of characters you're familiar with, but going along for that ride regardless and watching with bated interest to see how things unfold this time around is where the value lies. Marvel's Spider-Man takes inspiration from an Amazing Spider-Man storyline penned by Dan Slott, who is credited as a writer here. Peter's elderly Aunt May works at a homeless shelter run by Martin Li, an entrepreneur with a selfless heart of gold, but also a more negative side. Needless to say, things get complicated and worlds collide, but Insomniac takes multiple hard detours from the source material.Li and other antagonists also benefit from a generous amount of time devoted to exploring their humanity, through both cutscenes as well as environmental storytelling. Marvel's Spider-Man features segments where you explore key locations as Peter Parker, observing spaces, finding audio logs, listening to Pete's self-narration, chatting with characters, and playing minigames passed off as ""scientific research."" You'll also occasionally step into the shoes of other characters like Mary Jane, a Daily Bugle journalist in this timeline, as she dives into a more involved investigation using her own unique sets of skills.Mary Jane's stages feature rudimentary stealth mechanics on top of regular exploration, and her clandestine skillset becomes more diverse as you continue to revisit her side of the story. These mechanics aren't particularly demanding and you don't use them enough to wear out their welcome, but these supporting segments do feature some memorably tense scenarios and as a whole do help create a stronger attachment to the characters. It's easy to find yourself feeling more involved.All this narrative build-up pays off in a big way, too, and when the game does reach its tipping point, it's shocking how devastating the events can feel--even if you can predict what's coming. Marvel's Spider-Man is very good at making its stakes feel sky-high, evil actions genuinely villainous, consequences actually upsetting. The story is emotionally charged and effective at spurring you into action--late in the game, there's an urgency that builds up and succeeds in creating the superhero's dilemma of being pulled in multiple places at once, each option a dire situation, and the circumstances make you feel helpless despite your supernatural abilities. It's an incredible feeling, and the major beats of Spider-Man's story missions are certainly one of the game's highlights.The high bar set in the main plot shines a harsher light on the rest of the game's activities, though. The game features a number of side quests, most of which branch off the main story, but these don't have the same narrative energy as the main throughline, which makes them much less compelling. There are also a number of other optional activities, all ostensibly moderate tests of skill asking you to exercise your abilities in combat, traversal, or stealth. These challenges can be unique, but the dressing on them can also be uninspired, making them strange at best (curing avian flu in pigeons) and menial at worst (three different kinds of horde mode-style challenges).Dealing with trivial matters are all part of being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, of course. Randomly occurring crimes, as well as two different collectible-hunting activities that encourage you to explore the city, are the activities that best embody this idea, despite becoming repetitive. But when tasks like backing up computer data, relieving the city's steam pipe pressure, or catching pigeons suddenly become Spidey's number one, life-or-death priority when there's some pretty serious stuff going on in the main story, it's hard not to be a little bewildered.The best incentive to complete activities is tied to progression--each type offers its own unique tokens as the reward, used to purchase new suits, gadgets, and upgrades. Oddly, the most exciting activities are the ones plainly labeled as ""Challenge Missions."" These ask you to push yourself in time trials to break a series of benchmarks records for bonus tokens. Completing challenge missions are surprisingly the most motivating and rewarding of all the activities, even containing some special surprises.The strangest part about the game's activities lies in the use of a trite open-world mechanic: tower reveals. You begin the game with a blank world map, and it's necessary to make time to traverse through each of Manhattan's neighborhoods to find and reactivate a number of towers in order to uncover the map and pinpoint optional activities. There is some light narrative justification for this (Spidey needs to get access to local police radio for info on crimes) but it doesn't address the puzzling nature of a veteran Spider-Man not innately knowing how to get around New York City.However, for all the bewildering mundanity, the optional activities do provide some welcome relief in pacing from the more intense episodes of the main story. In fact, the game at times will give Spidey (and by extension, you) dedicated time for breaks in between missions to clear your head with some silly, low-stakes activities. And in the end, despite their obvious flaws, they are undeniably irresistible to seek out and complete, purely because they act as a satisfactory enough reason to get out there and play with Spider-Man's sensational web-slinging mechanics.Swinging around New York as Spider-Man is endlessly fulfilling. It's a relatively straightforward system that isn't overly demanding on inputs, but the minor adjustments and variables in terrain you need to consider while in motion (webs require tangible attach points), as well as the weighty feeling of Spidey makes the process feel satisfyingly manual--there's just enough effort required to make you feel as if it's all on you. During a big swing, you may decide to hold on for just a little longer so you can leap higher and gain elevation. Then, while mid-somersault, you scan the environment and assess that a water tower atop a building you cleared is the best next option, so you accurately shoot a web to zip to its vertex, but when Spidey makes contact, you perfectly time a jump and push off with a bonus burst of forward momentum.The fluid animations, visual effects, and controller rumble play a big part in selling the intensity, the speed and the giddiness of flinging yourself through the air. Spidey transitions between different movement techniques seamlessly in most cases, and there's also a slowdown mechanic that assists in helping you make more accurate and graceful traversal decisions. Holding L2 will slow down time to a crawl and let you manually aim a zip-to-point maneuver, but also let you initiate surprise attacks on enemies or perform other tasks--taking a photo of an iconic NYC monument to complete a challenge mid-swing, for example, can give you a wonderful feeling of competency. Because it's such an involved task, swinging around is Spider-Man's greatest joy. Despite its simplicity, every move you connect feels like a small victory, and the pace is rhythmic enough that putting in the effort to move elegantly becomes an absorbing experience.There's a similar gratification to be had from Spider-Man's combat. The Arkham Asylum-inspired crowd fighting system suitably characterizes Spidey's acrobatic nature, and like web-slinging, observing the enemies and environment to find your next best move makes it a satisfying puzzle. It only takes a few hits for Spidey to go down, so picking the right gadgets and powers for the job, using the right techniques for different kinds of enemies, being proactive in using your skills to manage overwhelming groups, and working to earn buffs and long combos by focusing on hitting your attacks and dodges with perfect timing keeps even relatively unchallenging encounters interesting.Combat-specific challenges also encourage you to mix up your technique, but it's the fluid transitions between attacks and the appearance of a natural flow that again sell the excitement. Spidey's flashy finishers and their over-the-top camera movements work to add some pizazz in addition to being an excellent tool in their own right, though you'll see these animations countless time throughout the course of the game, and they do start to lose their impact. This also true of the optional stealth mechanics which, while effective, will often see you watching the same stealth takedown animations again and again if you choose to go down that path.What helps curb the monotony of combat later in the game are the story's boss battles. These fights are intensely chaotic affairs, featuring unique takedowns and bombastic set pieces. Though the solution to beating them doesn't take much to figure out, your opponents attack relentlessly, meaning you'll have to constantly stay on your toes, moving and dodging around while waiting for an opening--a dynamic that feels very true to the character, which goes a long way in making these moments memorable.Minor shortcomings don't detract from Insomniac's achievement in creating a game that feels like an authentic interpretation of a beloved creation. The feeling of embodying Spidey and using his abilities is astonishing, and the time spent on exploring its major characters help make its story feel heartfelt, despite superhero bombast. There have been open-world Spider-Man games before, but none so riveting and full of personality, none that explore and do justice to this many facets of the universe. Insomniac has created a superior Spider-Man experience that leaves a lasting impression, one that has you longing for just one more swing around New York City, even after the credits roll.In its transition to PC, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered retains the visual splendor it featured on PS5. The PC version is co-developed by Nixxes and hosts a suite of options for you to tinker with in order to tune performance and fidelity according to your system, with modern features sets such as ray tracing, Nvidia's DLSS, ultrawide monitor support, and more included. This remastered version also includes all three additional story DLC chapters which can be accessed from the start of the game (though this is ill-advised, given these post-game scenarios don't gracefully scale for an entry-level Spider-Man).Whether swinging through the streets of New York or admiring the details in Central Park, Spider-Man Remastered can look noticeably better on a powerful PC than on console. In our testing (using an RTX 3080 Ti, AMD Ryzen 5600X, and 32GB of DDR4-3200 RAM), running the game at its highest preset (with ray-traced reflections at High) at 1440p was a relative breeze without the need to depend on dynamic resolution settings or AI-based upscaling such as DLSS. The most taxing scenarios were those out in the open world, where your ability to zip through the city at speed puts strain on your hardware's ability to load everything quickly and at the desired detail levels you've chosen. It was here where the game usually hovered around the 60-80fps mark, with less-intense indoor scenes seeing double that on most occasions. Curiously, with this settings configuration, both GPU and CPU usage rarely went over 75%, despite the game having lots of room to push higher on a 165Hz display.Increasing the resolution to 4K did push up GPU utilization significantly, as expected, with the overall average now around 95%. With the game more bound by GPU horsepower, it's clearer now that at lower resolutions the CPU utilization is preventing much higher frame rates, at least when exploring the open world. Once indoors, the game routinely managed to hit the maximum refresh rate of my display, but without needing to increase overall utilization given the simplification of the scenes. This made dialing in the right settings for both tricky, especially when making use of the game's most taxing ray tracing settings, which could routinely drag down the frame rate below 60fps at 1440p without any upscaling help. Insomniac did improve performance on AMD CPUs with a patch a day before publishing, and it plans to continue optimizing this further.If you need to make use of the various upscaling options on offer, however, Spider-Man Remastered does come with some small caveats. You have three options to choose from, including Nvidia's DLSS, AMD's FSR 2.0 (which is still in early implementation, according to Insomniac), and IGTI (Insomniac Games Temporal Injection), each of which can be combined with a dynamic resolution option that targets a variety of base frame rates. Testing both DLSS and ITGI at their balanced presets, there's a noticeable improvement to GPU utilization but a smaller one on perceivable frame rates, given the open world's heavy reliance on CPU power. That's combined with an equally noticeable degradation to image quality, with ray-traced reflections suffering the most. Most notably when using DLSS, reflections feature a lot more noise when upscaled, to the point where they can seem in motion on static objects in some cases (scenes where rain is present are particularly bothersome)--a far cry from the pristine representation at native resolution rendering. It's, thankfully, far less noticeable in motion, but it might be too big of a concession given that your performance uplift could be negligible depending on your choice of processor, and whether or not the game is actually GPU-limited in most scenarios.Spider-Man Remastered is playable with a keyboard and mouse, too, now, but it's still best enjoyed with a controller. Full support is offered for all controllers that make use of Steam's API, with the correct button-mapping showing up in-game for Xbox and Sony DualSense controllers alike. The DualSense benefits from the work done on the PS5 version to include more accurate haptic and adaptive trigger support, but like all other games that utilize these features, you'll have to use the DualSense wired directly to your PC for them to work. Still, it's nice to feel the gentle pressure of the trigger that is applied at the apex of a swing, or the satisfying pitter-patter of rain on a gloomy day, so it's worth the hassle if you have a DualSense available."
4899,World War II Combat: Iwo Jima,2.0,0,"  As if to prove a point about just how awful video games can be, publisher Groove Games has released World War II Combat: Iwo Jima, the second game in a series that debuted earlier this year with the terrible Road to Berlin. Don't let the generic title fool you--this game is anything but innocuous. Iwo Jima is so dreadfully awful that when playing it, you'll feel more than just the sting of regret from throwing your $20 away. You'll feel frustration, anger, confusion, and amazement at the overwhelming dearth of quality, inspiration, and general effort in this title. Every single aspect of World War II Combat: Iwo Jima, from the punishing checkpoint system and generic mission design to the hideous graphics and bug-ridden gameplay make for a game that is completely without merit. If Iwo Jima proves anything, it's that if ever there were a series that doesn't deserve to be a series, it's the World War II Combat games.        As the name so plainly states, World War II Combat: Iwo Jima takes you through several missions set on the heavily contested island of Iwo Jima during World War II. You start out storming a beach and move on from there, single-handedly fighting through foggy jungles and crumbling villages to capture the island for the Allies. It's certainly a fine setting for a World War II shooter, with plenty of important battles and heroic missions to draw inspiration from. But the game mostly ignores this material; instead, it uses the name and some brief video clips to set the stage. This is far from effective, though, and you're left with an ugly, unsalvageable mess of a game.      As a first-person shooter, Iwo Jima has high standards to live up to on both the PC and the Xbox. But even if this game had come out five, or even 10, years ago, it would have still felt behind the times. It's a first-person shooter, so you start each mission with a few different types of weapons. You have a primary weapon, which is usually a rifle or machine gun; an explosive weapon, such as grenades or a rocket launcher; and two secondary weapons, these being a pistol and a knife. You're given no choice of which weapons to take with you into combat, and you can almost never pick up new weapons during the mission. You can find some grenades, and at one point you do get a completely useless flamethrower, but other than that, you're stuck with what you have.      Using these limited weapons, you have to work your way through each level while completing mission objectives. You might have to destroy three radios, take out a couple pillboxes, or sabotage some enemy airplanes. The objectives are all laid out right in front of you, so at least you don't have to go searching all over a level to find what you're looking for. In fact, the game actively discourages you from wandering off the beaten path by placing invisible mines all along the pathway, so if you try to go exploring, you'll get blown sky high. All of the enemies you fight look identical, and they all act like idiots. Some enemies will run right up to you and start firing wildly, sometimes expending full clips from point-blank range without hitting you once. Sometimes the enemies will just stand there and fire their rifles straight up into the air, which is rather bizarre. What's more bizarre is that they'll often  hit you even though their guns aren't aimed in your direction. Even more annoying is that the same random fire works both ways. Sometimes when you have a dead aim on an enemy's head, you can blast away and get no response. Other times you can use the sniper rifle for a one-hit kill with a well-placed footshot.       To their credit, the enemies in the game are all accomplished dancers. Sometimes you'll see enemies do the jitterbug as they try to move around by rapidly vibrating like windup toys, or you'll see them do a modified version of the moonwalk as they float along the ground backward without moving their legs. They also appear to be experts at doing the robot, as they twitch wildly and spasm about in a way that couldn't possibly be human. But while an enemy will appear to be busting a move, in actuality they're all just busted.     Despite that the enemies are entirely devoid of intelligence, they'll still end up killing you many, many times,  because they'll usually have a numbers and positional advantage over you. This wouldn't be so difficult to manage if there was any way to replenish your health, but there isn't. There are no medikits, and it only takes a few shots to kill you. There is a checkpoint system in the game, so you don't have to start over at the beginning of a level when you die. But if you pass a checkpoint with low health, you can find yourself in an impossible situation because you can't backtrack but you might not have enough health to survive to the next checkpoint. The only way out is to either start the entire level over again or keep playing and dying until you've memorized the exact placement and behavior of each enemy--and hope the game's random hit detection works out in your favor. It's an extremely aggravating design, because the game becomes an extended and exasperating exercise in trial and error, and your success depends more on dumb luck than on any measure of skill.     If you're sick of dealing with the sloppy gameplay in the single-player campaign, you can play a multiplayer game online with up to 16 players. However, unless you can convince some poor sap to purchase another copy of the game, you're going to have a hard time finding anyone online to play against. We were unable to find anyone to play against with the Xbox version, and although there a handful of people playing the PC version there aren't nearly enough to have a full 16-player game. It's safe to assume that if there aren't any players online a few weeks after the game was released, there won't be a sudden explosion of interest in the game later on. You can play against bots, but the multiplayer gameplay is just as watered down and unpleasant as the single-player campaign. There are the standard deathmatch and team deathmatch modes, as well as king-of-the-hill, capture-the-flag, and last-man-standing modes. None of them are the least bit interesting and certainly don't bring any worth to this game.        Visually, World War II Combat: Iwo Jima is a horrid mess of ugly textures, blocky character models, chunky animation, and severe clipping issues. The levels look so drab and full of unsightly hard edges that the short draw distance almost seems merciful. Every area is shrouded in thick fog that blocks out your view of anything more than a hundred yards away. Despite the very jagged, unnatural geometry of the terrain, nothing in the game is truly solid, since enemies often clip through doors and walls and will often clip through the ground or one another. There's very little detail to be found anywhere on Iwo Jima, to the extent that its inhabitants barely even have faces. On the PC, you can crank up the resolution, and on the Xbox you can play the game in 480p if you have a capable TV, but those options don't do anything to improve the look of the game. The sound is no more detailed and is mostly composed of repetitious, tinny gunfire and hollow explosions. There's an occasional, almost inaudible, mumbling from enemies, and the narration that sets up each level is so flat that it sounds synthesized. The music is generic and repetitive, as well, but it's easily the least offensive element of this game.      No matter how broke, desperate, or crazy about World War II you are, there's no reason to play this game. If you're looking for a cheap shooter, go to the store and grab any game off the shelf and you're practically guaranteed to have a better game than this one. Whatever you do, don't play World War II Combat: Iwo Jima.     "
2402,Resident Evil: Revelations,6.0,1,"Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City and Resident Evil 6 utterly lacked the nail-biting action the series was once known for, making it impossible to see in them any glimmer of the franchise's former greatness. So in a sense, the release of Resident Evil: Revelations on consoles and PC is cause for celebration. First released on the 3DS last year, Revelations is both the best Resident Evil game of the past few years and the one that's the most true to the series' roots. There's something to be said for that. But taken on its own terms, it's not a great game. It's not remotely scary, and the enemy design is uninspired. Still, Revelations is competent enough to remind you of what Resident Evil can be, even if it doesn't get under your skin the way the best games in the series do.        Set between Resident Evil 4 and 5, Revelations' tale is more concerned with organizations--the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance, the Federal Bioterrorism Commission, and the terror group Veltro--than with individuals. Series mainstays Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield are on hand, but they don't get any opportunities for character development here; they're just familiar pawns in the series' latest sinister, overly complicated conspiracy.      They're joined by one likable new character, and one awful one. Jill's partner, Parker, bears an unmistakable resemblance to actor Russell Crowe; looks aside, he's a good-humored companion, someone you'd like to have by your side in a crisis. Chris' partner, Jessica, on the other hand, is so obnoxious and absurd as to strain credulity, even in a story about ooze monsters. When Chris has been injured and she responds, ""Me and my sweet ass are on the way!"" it's so goofy that it takes you out of the moment, and a one-legged outfit she wears later in the game makes her look like a member of an avant-garde dance troupe, not a counterterrorism task force.     The bulk of Revelations takes place on the Queen Zenobia, a luxury ocean liner with plenty of cramped corridors that make for claustrophobic combat. The ship's elegant cabins, casinos, and promenades contrast with its bilges, freight lifts, and other metallic environments, which makes your initial explorations of the ship rewarding. The Queen Zenobia's layout is convincing, making it easy to buy into the idea that it's a real ship with a long and grisly history. But before you've advanced too far through the campaign, you've seen most of what the Zenobia has to offer, and you spend much of your time trekking back through areas you've already covered.      Things may have changed somewhat--you might be able to access rooms you couldn't before, or you may encounter new enemy types--but the sense of discovery that helps make the early sections intriguing wears off too soon. Still, the way the story is broken up into short, episodic sections, jumping back and forth frequently between characters and locations, keeps the pacing brisk; you never get tired of one situation before you're whisked off to another.         Of course, you're not on the Queen Zenobia for a pleasure cruise; terrible things have happened aboard that ship, and as a result, you're constantly attacked by bio-organic weapons, some of which look like people covered head to toe in gray ooze and others of which resemble human-size lizard creatures from a low-budget monster movie. Confrontations are sometimes more campy than chilling, and the fact that you can perform cartoonish melee attacks, complete with goofy windups, on stunned enemies, only adds to the silliness.     If you've played Resident Evil 4 or 5, the controls and combat here will feel familiar. The camera's closeness to your character limits your peripheral vision, fostering a feeling that you never know what's just around the next corner. The problem is that Revelations never does much of anything with this; you're never startled to discover an enemy you didn't know was there or given a reason to dread what might be lurking in the shadows ahead. There's a halfhearted creepiness to the atmosphere of Revelations, but never anything that might generate actual fear or dread.     Instead, the combat is typically straightforward rather than scary. Your weapons feel powerful, and only become more powerful as you augment them with parts you find, but they never feel overpowered; your enemies' resilience makes you grateful for every ounce of firepower you can wring out of those weapons. You rarely feel truly threatened or desperate, but enemies can still corner you in tight spaces, generating some tension as you fill them with bullets and hope they go down before they get close enough to grab you. (You don't want that to happen, both because you get injured and because you're prompted to do some unpleasant stick-wiggling or mouse-shaking to struggle free.)         Some environments give you a bit more freedom to move around, with opportunities to leap to lower levels to temporarily flee from encroaching attackers. These areas might fill with monsters that close in on you before you blow up an explosive tank at the last second, incinerating your enemies and making your escape. You've probably experienced moments like this in games many times before, but they're still satisfying.     Unfortunately, though the best games in the series feature confrontations with memorable, horrifying bosses, the boss battles here, like everything else about Revelations, are standard. Bosses can dish out and withstand plenty of damage, but their designs and their attack patterns are all par for the course. Outside of the campaign, there's Raid mode, an opportunity to fight off enemies solo or with another player, and though the process of leveling up and earning points with which you can purchase more and better gear is predictably compelling, the combat still lacks the spark of scariness that infused the action of earlier Resident Evil entries. Revelations is a decent adventure, but it doesn't come close to reaching the heights the series has in the past.  "
726,Objects in Space,8.0,2,"Space, as I'm sure we're all aware, is incomprehensibly vast. It can be difficult to fathom the scope of large nations in earnest, to say nothing of the endless expanse of the universe. While the vastness of space and its inherent loneliness has been explored time and again in fiction, Objects in Space contributes to that conversation by capturing the beauty of the mundane as you helm a solitary freighter drifting to and fro in a desolate void. Moreover, it positions itself as a rework of '90s adventure games, but with the added draw of real-time combat and problem solving as you and your hauler make your way.Objects in Space immediately taps your imagination of a grand adventure to the stars. You are one of the first truly interstellar explorers, launched aboard the mighty Cassandra--a colony-spawning vessel with nearly a million inhabitants. Alongside dozens of support craft, the mission of this mega-ship was to create a jumpgate, allowing instant transit back to Earth. Unfortunately, your destination, the Apollo Cluster, was all but barren, putting a major kink in the plan. Even worse, due to some unexpected anomalies, a few of the accompanying ships in Cassandra's support fleet arrived decades later than intended--including yours.When you finally arrive, your ship is spinning out of control thanks to damage sustained on the trip. A friendly passerby quickly offers their assistance, guiding you through the repairs and introducing you to the basics of your ship. Life in Apollo Cluster is surprisingly low-tech, despite its interstellar nature. As a result, you'll be listening the telltale squeal of metal scraping rock or the klaxon warning of an inbound projectile.Flight is a decidedly sensory experience in Objects in Space. You're planted at the center of an array of controls, dials, knobs, and monitors. Important data is often split across multiple screens (which is to say both in-game view screens and your own real-world vantage point), with engineering info being kept to a seperate station than the helm or comms. with the constant feed of environmental information, you're always juggling a few different streams of information and responsibilities at any given point.It's common to set off in a direction and accidentally end up in a pirate-packed nebula or anomaly. These threats require hands-on scanning, and rapid course adjustments. If you don't have enough speed, you can flip off nonessential systems and give the engines a full burn. The sum of these small decisions about piloting, maneuvering and maintenance are often quite impressive, and leave you with the distinct sensation that your experience and your knowledge of your ship get you out of trouble. It's quite a bit to manage, but your trek through the stars gets its texture from the emergent narrative of your choices.The set-up and execution both work together to set the stage for a great bit of speculative fiction and an excuse to dump you into sociological crucible with only your ship as a trusty companion. In many respects, how you play and what happens along your journey is a vital component of the experience. And by simulating all the mundane bits of space travel, it asks you to fully inhabit the role of space captain at the edge of the cosmos. What you encounter and how you grapple with it becomes an intrinsic part of not just the story, but the story you compose hand-in-hand with the game.The granularity of the simulation helps build a relationship between you and your ship. Drifting in the black, your ship is your companion. It's the only thing protecting your flesh and bone from the utter lethality of radiation, micro-meteorites, and, of course, that lung-rending vacuum. You'd expect it, then, to be a tough machine--and many ships are, to a point--but they're also vulnerable. When you jump, every system needs to reboot, selling the idea that this is a tremendous feat--one that not even this rugged, mechanical beast can handle.Your ship can hide secrets and quirks, too. You may or may not discover window shutters, posters, or the like on your particular model. The layout of each ship and system is markedly different. Parts can be swapped out, but only at dock. Changes to your companion are thus a big deal, requiring you to plot a course and go through all the standard docking procedures, and then recruit the help of the station's robotic arms to rearrange things. When it breaks down or gets hit by just about anything, you feel it. Objects in Space uses its aesthetics--both visual and ludic--to craft an enchanting atmosphere.Objects in Space is committed to its own brand of realism, fashioned from the experience of inhabiting a place. As such, your ship's status is linked to your capabilities; as your ship takes damage, systems will work sporadically before finally giving out. This creates a bit of a moving target--your goal is always to survive, but the challenge grows when you're carrying battle damage from a prior encounter or your sensors are spotty. As a point of contrast, though, you'll also have plenty time to simply “live” in your ship, as it were.Because this is space, when you are ready to dart off, your course will usually take several minutes or longer. Most of that is downtime, though, unless some obstacle or scenario arises. And it's here that you get quiet moments with little but the hum of your drives and the synth music from your ship's radio to keep you company. These segments of peace do a lot to punctuate the frantic crisis management that permeates many missions.The obstacles of your journey are somewhat predictable. Pirates, asteroids, and so on are all pretty standard fare, though how you grapple with and overcome them is always unique. With such a broad array of options and tactics to use--dumping cargo, creative flying, etc.--you're mostly limited by your imagination and cleverness. Some strategies, like flipping your ship into a weird position, drawing others into a fight, or nixing non-essential systems to save up power for a massive engine burn, when executed well, give you the feeling of being not just a brilliant captain, but the entire crew of a much larger spacecraft. There's a raw, almost space cowboy feeling that emerges after a few encounters that permeates the game. And, provided that you keep flying, you'll feel like a hotshot scoundrel in no time.Those with affinity for the kind of nuanced technical challenges of running a space freight business will be enraptured, but such players will be far from the only ones. In its best moments, Objects in Space can work a unique kind of magic. Few other games pull away the barriers between ship and captain so completely, and yet lean so hard on the mundane. Pulling yourself away from the real world and allowing the mysteries and adventure soak in can take a bit, but once you're settled into your chair and piloting, you'll find there you'll find there's no place quite like it anywhere--be it our world or its own."
1516,NHL 16,8.0,2," The gameplay feels great, online and off. Every facet of NHL 16 is more fluid than those in previous years, and it feels like you have more control over each position. I felt it was easier to move the puck across the ice while skating and passing, and playing defense is an experience that feels a lot better, too -- when I hit someone, it feels powerful. This is also evident when you play goalie; the controls for goaltending have been redone, making it easier to move precisely and catch those tricky one-timers. Because of this, I’ve grown to actually enjoy goaltending, so when no one else will guard the net in a game, I’m more than happy to take the job. The On-Ice Trainer is a visual aid that augments the ice and skaters with hints, teaching you how to play the game while you play. It starts off with the basics, such as face-offs and shooting, then it moves on to more advanced skills as you prove you’ve become proficient. It’ll tell you how to take a wristshot, and once you’ve done it enough, it’ll move you on to slapshots. This was very useful for me when it came to face-offs because I’ve always had a hard time understanding exactly how they worked -- at times, I’d think I had a handle on them, but I would be proved wrong soon after. With the On-Ice Trainer, there’s no confusion: it tells me exactly how to win and why I failed or succeeded. These hints disappear organically or you can turn them off entirely. It’s an incredible tool that helped me become a stronger player, and although I was worried about becoming dependent on the trainer, I was tackling and winning face-offs without even realizing that the tips had vanished. The On-Ice Trainer was especially useful in Be A Pro mode, which allows you to create a skater and proceed from the minors to the end of a long, hopefully prosperous NHL career. You can go through the minors as a CHL rookie or skip that and join a team that’s already competing for the Memorial Cup. Your job is to play a role on a team based on the position you choose. The trainer can help here, but even if you don’t use it, you’ll still get detailed instructions from your coach telling you how to improve your game in three different areas: offense, defense, and team play. All you have to do to become a stronger player is play; taking shots and poke checking will give you experience in their respective categories, in this case offense and defense. One problem I had with Be a Pro occurred when my player led the league in goals and points but was bumped off the starting formation, which gave him less ice time. My player was demoted because he was lacking defensive and team play skills, but scoring two or more goals a game and being punished seemed a little weird, especially since I was posting numbers higher than anyone else in the league. Despite this issue, it’s enjoyable and immensely satisfying when you make a lot of progress. Be A GM is an entertaining mode, one in which I lost hours in the menus alone. Whether I’m trying to make that clutch trade or having my heart broken because I couldn’t seal a deal with a favourite player, I’m engaged in the fantasy team I’m creating. Making the choices you wish your favourite team’s manager would make feels empowering; putting together the next Stanley Cup champions takes a lot of work, but it’s satisfying when it pays off. The offline shootout joins its online counterpart again this year, something that I’m personally glad to see happen. Playing shootouts against a friend provided some of the most fun I’ve had playing the NHL series, often resulting in a lot of trash talking and laughter. Moments when you hope you can fake out your friend to get the puck past them are exhilarating; quickly starting a rematch keeps the competition high, preventing the intensity from being killed by a load time. It doesn’t translate to online multiplayer because you aren’t shoulder-to-shoulder with a friend, which makes its return after its absence in NHL 15 greatly appreciated. Online versus and team play are both engaging when you want to play against someone other than an A.I. opponent, but Hockey Ultimate Team is where I spent most of my time online. Ultimate Team has you open a pack of cards at the start, which will be used as your first line-up for the team you create. Once your team is ready, you can take it online or play against the A.I. You can always grind for more in-game currency to spend on packs, but if you want to get cards faster, you can also buy packs with real money. After buying a couple of packs with real money and in-game currency and creating the best line-up I could muster, I became invested in my team. Winning games also felt like more of an accomplishment because I had to work with what I was given. Losing games, on the other hand, made me feel like I needed to buy another pack in the hopes of getting a better goalie. However, you never know what you’re getting, and not every pack had cards that I could use to improve my given lineup. Considering that each Gold Jumbo pack costs 4 or 5 dollars, spending in-game currency, let alone real money, to end up with a pack of disappointing cards is a momentary turn-off. I’ve put a lot of time into this mode, and I will continue to do so as time goes on, but because there’s no guarantee that I’ll get a card that suits my needs, there’s little chance that I’ll spend any more real money on cards. The EASHL also returns after being removed from last year’s game, and the changes EA made provide a more balanced experience. You create and customize your own pro player, and at the beginning of each game, you choose a position and class, such as power forward, sniper, and butterfly goalie. Each class plays differently, and by focusing on one position for an entire game, you ultimately learn how to become a better player overall. When I played as power forward, I threw a lot of hard hits and cleared the ice because of it. When I played as a sniper, I was faster and scored more goals. Your player’s progress in EASHL is measured by badges, which you earn by completing class-specific feats, such as scoring goals or making saves. These contribute to your player’s overall level, and it feels good to be rewarded for closing out a game with a shutout or scoring a hat trick. EASHL allows you to play games as a member of a club or by dropping into a match with a group of strangers. Dropping into random games is hit-or-miss; it’s not uncommon for teammates to drop out of a game if your team is losing. This makes the experience incredibly frustrating, and it happens far too often. I had more fun playing with a club, with people sticking together as a team and not leaving games at the drop of a hat. While playing online, I’ve encountered at least one instance of stuttering per game. I’ve experienced games that have been near unplayable, but those have been very far and few between. NHL 16’s menus can be confusing, and the plethora of information within team rosters isn’t always easy to decipher at a quick glance. The in-game presentation, however, is superb. Every stadium feels genuine. The Blue Jackets’ Nationwide Arena fires a cannon every time they score, the Tampa Bay Lightning have their Tesla coils going at Amelie Arena, and the Vancouver Canucks’ Green Men show up at Rogers Arena from time to time to heckle the opposing team’s players. It feels weird to geek out about a hockey video game, but these little touches are exciting to see, making the arena’s atmosphere feel more alive in the process. NHL 16 is exciting not only for dedicated fans due to the return of the long-lost modes of years past but also for new players or even people who just want to get better. The On-Ice Trainer is an awesome alternative to tutorials, and it makes me hope that other companies, not just those making sports games, will find a way to implement similar tools. NHL 16 is a huge improvement over NHL 15 in every way, and it makes me optimistic for the future of the franchise.  "
