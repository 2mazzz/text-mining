0,Lethal Company Early Access ,7.0,"It’s a heck of a time, running through an abandoned bunker in the dark with nothing but a hazmat suit on your back and three of your closest buds at your side. Oh wait, that’s not your closest bud at all – it’s a grotesque, white-eyed monster eating their corpse and using their body like a puppet. Welcome to Lethal Company, a co-op survival horror game that’s all about digging deep into the (procedurally-generated and largely haunted) crevasses of exoplanetary human history for loot, which your party of up to four companions will need to figure out how to safely transport back to your ship and eventually sell to your eldritch bosses at the end of each round. This is a simple but highly enjoyable premise, and thankfully, there’s enough chaos decking the halls of its current early access version to sink an entire weekend into its depths without realizing you’ve done so. But, even with such a riveting loop and plenty of monsters to make it satisfyingly treacherous, Lethal Company does still feel like the work-in-progress it is thanks to its janky graphics and having little-to-no story to carry it. Each successful run through these abandoned lunar tunnels lets everyone in your squad invest in better gear – like flashlights and eventually high-powered jetpacks – so that you can take on higher-tier expeditions to places like the elusive and extremely dangerous moon of Jupiter, Titan. Inventory space is rather limited – you’re given only four slots in total, and they’re quickly strained when you factor in that you effectively need to carry a flashlight or a walkie-talkie. Both are crucial to survival but difficult to recover if something goes wrong deep inside of a dungeon, where your teammates won’t easily be able to recover your body. At least those items aren’t too expensive to replace.  Regardless, everything in your inventory weighs you down, making it appropriately tough to get away if you’re carrying a heavy load of loot. Thanks to Lethal Company’s plethora of challenges and secret dangers, it’s an absolute blast to try to escape, even when you die horrifically. Even after being blasted to bits by a hidden turret or getting chomped on by one of the many cosmic horrors awaiting me in the twisting corridors, it was still a joy to watch my surviving teammates outrun death. My favorite comic relief moments even took place from the comfort of the death cam – for instance, when one of my teammates tried to haul a big piece of scrap, screaming from the top of their lungs in sheer terror while something chased them across the map. I’ve deeply enjoyed learning how Lethal Company works, getting a little savvier with each run – and even after spending about 15 hours with it, I still feel like there’s plenty left to discover. What’s hiding on the frozen moon of Rend? Has anyone heard about the mysterious ghost girl who only appears to one crewmate at a time before she kills them? How did that guy just get eaten back at base? And, on a side note, why am I gaining experience points and leveling up when there are no unlocks? It’s a little frustrating that Lethal Company raises a few questions like that that it doesn’t yet have answers to. Right now, progression does absolutely nothing, and virtually nothing is carried between save files. That means you’ll need to restart often, even if you survive long enough to reach the endgame in a public group and have to dip out for some reason. But hey, at least there are no microtransactions. Still, Lethal Company already instills a sense of wonder, subtly mimicking the early days of Minecraft in the way I had almost no clue what I was going to find whenever I selected my destination at the beginning of every in-game day. There are eight different explorable moons, each varying in difficulty – with higher-difficulty moons costing more currency to land on, so you effectively have to ante up before you make your run. The surface of each moon is static, so it’s possible to familiarize yourself with their maps and attempt to plan your route ahead of an excursion. But the real excitement begins once you and your crew enter the labyrinthine underground complexes. Everything from outdoor weather to the interior layout to enemy spawns and loot locations varies between runs, so there’s enough unpredictability to keep you on your toes. For every run, you’re only given three in-game days to find enough scrap to reach your profit quota, meaning there’s a baked-in deadline and you’re racing against the clock. Once it strikes 5:30 PM you’d better be ready to blast off, because the entire landscape becomes a living threat. Luckily, each in-game day is reasonably long, around 10 minutes or so, and I’ve encountered countless moments where I became separated from a teammate as they faced what seemed like a certain death, only for us to rendezvous back at the ship and share our wildly differing stories of how we individually survived and made our way back to safety. But it loses some momentum because there isn’t too much to carry you forward from one run to the next. There’s zero story to follow; progress through the campaign is entirely about surviving to meet the next quota, and that’s it. And even with procedural generation, or maybe because of it, the endless bunkers and basements of Lethal Company’s lowest-tier planets all look alike… and this means they can get stale very quickly. It’s nice that there are a few different types of interior environments later on, but they’re locked behind higher-tier zones that require a bit of time and grinding to earn access to. This means you’ll scrounge your way through tens or even hundreds of abandoned bunkers before you find your way to an abandoned mansion, and I wish those alternative locations showed up earlier. Most of the enjoyment in Lethal Company comes from multiplayer antics. Like any co-op game, communication and coordination are key to carefully planning and executing the safe extraction of loot from the bowels of a dungeon – with all of your party members intact, at least – and all that underlying tension truly reaches its zenith when your initial plan goes awry, scattering your team and sending you running for your lives. Each of these terrifying adversaries have different tricks and strategies, forcing you to adapt accordingly. For example, the shadowy Brakken stalks its prey while shying away from direct light, but it has a knack for easily skirting around corridors in the dark and flanking unaware adventurers. At the same time you have to keep an eye out for the creepy doll-esque Coil-Head, which rushes toward you at lightning speed unless you’re looking directly at it, in which case it freezes in place like a Dr. Who Weeping Angel statue. Most of these opponents range from fairly difficult to impossible to kill, and this is partially because Lethal Company rarely equips you with conventional weaponry. There are no guns here; your best bet is a melee weapon like a yield sign. Thus, combat is largely untenable. Especially against the most challenging enemies, like the giant Forest Keeper or the terrifying jack-in-the-box-like Jester. Most of the time, it’s best to lighten your load and run in the opposite direction. Spicing things up even more, sounds attract the attention of these nefarious monsters – including any noises picked up by each player’s microphone. Setting up Push to Talk is a good way to stay covert when you don’t need to speak, but chatting with your teammates is a fundamental survival tool. This built-in limitation makes every bit of communication significantly more important – you have to keep chatter to a minimum, especially around sound-sensitive monsters like the Eyeless Dogs that prowl the outskirts of your ship at night. Inversely, talking to your teammates over walkie-talkies or while huddled in a group can keep your avatar’s sanity meter from filling up, lessening the chances of monsters spawning in the first place. This mechanic keeps Lethal Company interesting at all times, especially since you can use a particularly loud teammate as a tool to, for instance, draw monsters away from a valuable piece of loot. It’s all made a bit simpler once you’re able to equip multiple party members with walkie-talkies, including at least one who can stay behind on the ship – directing your expedition over radio comms while opening doors remotely and helping you navigate around potential threats by telling you where to go. That said, I found it’s a bit of a chore to sit in the ship and direct everything instead of venturing into the dungeon. At least it gets a bit more interesting after dark when monsters spawn near the ship. This forces the operator to be quiet, otherwise, they’ll invite the unwanted attention of passing creatures who can break in and eat them. Darkness is as much an antagonist as any of the marauding creatures stalking Lethal Company’s hallways. Everything – even the interior of your ship – is dark, dreary, muddy, and deeply unsettling. Most of the time, unrelenting darkness obscures potential threats or even portrays distant team members as oncoming monsters. As in other survival horror games like Alan Wake 2, the most powerful weapon at your disposal is often a flashlight, which cuts through darkness and allows you to safely navigate out of harm’s way. Also, it’s smart that Lethal Company’s flashlights both hold a limited charge and can potentially attract unwanted threats when turned on or off, forcing you to be tactical about how and when you use them. To conserve light during one session, all four of my crewmates huddled together and took turns walking in front with a single flashlight, guiding all of us toward the exit like we were a delightfully doomed version of Scooby and the gang. Lethal Company’s constant tension is partially due to its low-fi graphical style, which obscures details and makes everything look like it was rendered on a PlayStation 1. That’s a double-edged sword – especially when low-resolution art, inelegant character animations, and chunky monster designs work against its otherwise gripping atmosphere. Sometimes, what would’ve been a scary moment rapidly devolves into a less welcome kind of comedy when a creature glitches through the geometry of the map. That’s a shame, because the way Lethal Company blends built-in voice chat into its 3D-positioned audio system makes it deftly effective as a survival game with rich horror elements – everything from stomping monsters to the terrified screams of your teammates to a rusty door jarring itself open somewhere down the hallway behind you is all skillfully attenuated to up the spooky ante. There’s nothing quite like a multiplayer survival-horror game that’s as unceasingly spooky as it is hilariously chaotic – and there are few that manage to balance horror and comedy as well as Lethal Company. Even in its early access phase, this co-op loot hunt manages to transcend its limited content and missing systems, making it a good time for those willing to brave its haunted halls – especially with the volume turned up. Still, there’s no real story to speak of, and its tension is deflated a bit by an unappealing and jankily animated art style, overused dungeon templates, and an unrealized progression system that feels as cold and lifeless as the void. We can expect to see a lot of that get improved on during early access, of course. But what it lacks in features right now, it makes up for by offering a strong survival loop that’s satisfying enough to make me want to stick around and see it get built upon. It’s already well worth trying out with a group of buds. "
1,The Walking Dead: Destinies ,2.0,"Zombies can be fun to mow down, but they also run the risk of being one of the least interesting monster enemy types around: a slow, lumbering, decaying husk that’s better off buried than occupying our attention. If nothing else, The Walking Dead: Destinies, based off the otherwise fantastic early seasons of the TV show, succeeds in embodying all their worst qualities. In its ugly, shuffling attempts to stand tall even while looking like rotting husk of a game from the Xbox 360 days, Destinies deserves neither your attention nor access to your wallet – and we would be better off if this boring mess had stayed buried in the past, from which it seems to have exhumed its broken mechanics. While it earns a small amount of credit for at least attempting to play with plots that diverge from the TV show, little else is done to elevate it above the muck of banal design, awful character models, and the laughable sense that this is barely a rough draft of a game. Longtime fans of the TV show are clearly the target audience here, since the characters poorly mimic the visual likenesses of their real performers. But aside from trying to strike a chord through recognisability, Destinies presumes you know the entire melody as you’re unceremoniously thrown into the shoes of Rick Grimes after he wakes up in the hospital alone.  It is here – right at the beginning of what became eight to nine painful hours – that everything falls apart. The hospital is, naturally, filled with zombies and Rick must find his way out with some basic mechanics like pushing, sneaking, and healing that we’ve seen in essentially every third-person post-apocalyptic horror game ever, but worse. Zombies are, of course, mindless by design, but these are some of the most incompetent enemies you will encounter in any video game. Aside from there only being about three zombie models, they also get stuck in walls, glitch through the ceiling, collide with each other, and pose about as much threat as a wet sock on a carpet: annoying and unsightly, but otherwise forgettable. Destinies is ugly as sin, with hideous character models, terrible lighting, and homely environments that themselves are re-used multiple times. I have been playing plenty of games out of my backlog from the Xbox 360 days on my Series X lately, and I can tell you this current-gen game looks worse than the nearly 20-year-old GTA IV. The texture resolution reminds me of bad webcams we all endured during early COVID-19 Zoom calls. At the very least, the frame rate seemed consistent at 60fps on PS5, when it wasn’t crashing or failing to display its so-called cutscenes. I also hit several game-breaking bugs, one of which required a full restart. Also, during a boss fight, my character refused to interact with the enemy to initiate a cutscene. Not to mention sound and music would vanish for no reason, until I restarted. Speaking of, the cutscenes themselves are consistent with those cheap-looking placeholder types we’ve seen in games like Redfall and Rise of Kong (which Destinies publisher GameMill was also behind). Characters are displayed in static poses while their voice actors deliver lines, giving you the opportunity to see their terrible designs in full glory. They are clearly meant to vaguely resemble their TV counterparts, but they look like what you’d get if you asked me to draw them from memory. Strangely enough, the voice performances are actually not atrocious, but the actors didn’t have much to work with. For example, they all have one-liners when taking down enemies or fighting them off – “My blood’s boiling!” “Get off me!” and so on – all of which repeat endlessly. In the context of a dangerous world of constant terror, hearing weird action movie one-liners from both an ex-cop and a 70-year-old farmer was jarring. Destinies doesn’t even retell the show’s story well. For example, early on when Rick’s son Carl is shot, it is never explained who shot him, and no one seems to know or care. At all. In fact, Otis, the culprit in the show, never even appears in Destinies. Instead, the survivors simply grab the boy and run off to the Greene farm story arc that infamously slowed the series’ pace down. The only thing Destinies has going for it is being able to play with the titular dynamic: the fates of its characters. There are many occasions where you must make a binary decision that leads to the death or abandonment of a survivor. If you know the show, it is of course enjoyable to make the decision that runs against the established plot. Most notably, you can basically recast the main character, choosing who wins the fight between Rick and Shane after they spend some time on the farm, letting Shane can take over as husband and father to Rick’s family. That’s a pretty dramatic, fundamental change! It's clear the developers had some love for the show, given the work put in to portraying Shane as we’ve never seen him. His hair and beard grow out, he forms relationships with characters he never met, and so on. Another good example of an impactful decision involves changing who becomes the final boss’s right-hand man, flowing from a decision you make in the first few hours. But, unfortunately, this is only interesting conceptually, since it still fails miserably in execution, and naturally most decisions do little to affect the actual plot. The survivors move through different camp areas in their grand road trip, such as the previously mentioned farm and later a prison. These become hub areas where you do three things: start the next main and side missions, resolve a meaningless conflict between two characters, and “talk” to other survivors. And by talk, I mean each person will say one arbitrary, generic line whenever you go back to the hub area, offering no reflection on the events happening around them. For example, Rick's wife Lori will tell the man who blew her husband’s brains out about how she enjoys making pancakes for the family on Sundays. Each main mission usually sees you playing as a different survivor. Often this makes little sense, since you’re generally by yourself or playing as the worst person for the task at hand. For example, a few hours into Destinies, Lori gives birth in the prison – but a few minutes later you’re playing as her to recover items from a nearby department store. There were many other survivors who did not just endure a birth in a zombie apocalypse who could have gone, but sure, let’s send the new mother. No explanation is given. Another time, a 70-year-old farmer is sent – alone – to recover an assault rifle and ammo in the basement of the prison. You’re never told why someone who actually handles weapons – like a younger, more agile police officer, for instance – could not have gone instead, or at least accompanied the old farmer. Destinies attempts to shake up the scenarios in its main quests, but they all come down to either getting to a specific part of the map or collecting items. Very rarely will two characters be together, assisting one another – which was a central focus of the entire show and its spinoffs. There was an opportunity to have one character make decisions that a second character would have to endure the consequences of, but Destinies does nothing with this. In fact, it’s just not very good at consequences in general. The central and titular dynamic of Destinies is watching your choices define the lives of these survivors, but it doesn’t function well enough to maintain the illusion. More than once, I saw characters I had killed – deliberately or inadvertently – appear during cutscenes. Rick’s son, who died from a gunshot in my playthrough, was running from the farm in a static cutscene; Rick himself, who I had Shane kill, appeared for a solid few seconds battling the horde in the final fight. This may be a universe where the dead return from the grave, but I don’t think Destinies is doing it right. Each survivor has various unique skills that can be upgraded by acquiring skill points, either through completing tasks or… finding radios, for some reason? For example, the pizza delivery guy can upgrade his sneaking movement speed to avoid conflict with zombies, or Rick’s revolver can do more damage. The skill tree is a massive eyesore, and ultimately meaningless – in the first two hours, I had already maxed it out for everyone. Even fully upgraded, combat in Destinies is some of the worst you will experience, and feels as though it might’ve been lifted from shovelware of previous console generations. There is no kickback or feel to guns or melee weapons. Shooting is floaty and unresponsive, with terrible auto-lock that has you targeting enemies nowhere near you. Every character has the exact same set of moves, whether they are a fit hunter or a new mom. Characters can use a kind of super move when they’ve built enough “adrenaline”, which restores health and kills enemies instantly, but that also feels pointless when you’re fighting zombies that are so slow and die in two hits. You do eventually begin to encounter tougher human enemies, but their armor and agility just means they are more irritating and take longer to kill. Oddly, they are also introduced out of nowhere and not spoken of at all. They first appear during Shane’s only flashback sequence to when he was trying to rescue Rick from the hospital – who are they? What do they want? Why are they attacking Shane? Sorry, you’ll never know if you haven’t watched the TV series. Shane himself never reacts to it. A boring, ugly mess of a game to be avoided at all costs, The Walking Dead: Destinies fails to do anything interesting with the story and characters of the popular TV show it’s based on. While the ghost of a promising concept haunts the periphery – that of making choices different from what happened i the early seasons of the show and watching them play out – its horrendous graphics, weightless combat, repetitive mission design, and as many bugs as zombies reduce Destinies to the gaming equivalent of a biological hazard. "
2,SteamWorld Build ,7.0,"I'm not sure I've seen a more original premise for a city builder than ""grow a frontier boomtown populated entirely by retrofuturistic steam-powered robots"" in a long time. That makes SteamWorld Build a refreshing drink of water in a trackless desert compared to the many, many trend-chasing builders we've seen over the last few years – and while you build a town above, it sets itself apart further by having you simultaneously excavate a mine below in search of both mineral resources and pieces of ancient technology that can be used to escape your dying planet. It's a short, sweet city builder that doesn't do too much new beyond that setup, but uses the parts it has to make a fun whole I know I'll revisit in the future. As has been the case for a decade, the SteamWorld games have a really well-established palette of character designs, colors, and even sounds to draw from. The result is a game world stylistically on par with much larger, more established franchises — like the Warcraft universe — that adapts really well to different genres without losing its visual distinction, personality, and setting. That’s still true in SteamWorld Build, where the goofily stylized robots that chug along to the same twangy country-western guitar tracks with the same silly voices are as charming as ever. It's a planet of steam-powered robots that all have accents like a Scandinavian person pretending to be from the old west, and by God does it still work here.  SteamWorld Build's central rules are nothing new in a city builder. You provide citizens with services and produce goods, both of which let you eventually upgrade those same citizens to higher tiers – Settlers to Engineers to Aristobots to Scientists – and unlock new buildings that offer even more stuff for that next tier of bots. If you’re looking for a deep simulation of each citizen's needs, you won't find anything like that here, but the simplicity is a strength in its own ways. Fans of series like Anno will pretty quickly get what SteamWorld Build is doing and almost surely enjoy it, as will those like me who remember the older Impressions City Building series. Services are routed to your metallic folk through a basic system of distance: Everything moves over roads you’ll lay down, and any house in range of a service building immediately has access to it. Goods are produced at a specific rate, and you can stockpile some, but mostly you'll rely on having just as much coming in as going out, trading excess away at your town’s train station. But it’s not entirely cut and dry, as your town simultaneously spreads underground. You’ll recruit miners, prospectors, and mechanics to excavate, extract, and improve your mining works. At first you’ll focus on finding easily-removed chunks of ore in dirt and rock, but later you have to supply expendable tools like pickaxes and drills to remove harder stone obstructions. And while the resources you find above initially support the mine works, eventually that flip-flops as the town needs the oil, water, and old tech you excavate below. There’s a simple yet satisfying loop as engineers from the town help you recruit mechanics to work underneath it, who then install and maintain auto-extracting machines on resource veins you find, growing your tunnels further so you can expand more, and faster, both above and below. You'll eventually need security bots to keep the underground works functional and safe from whatever monstrous bugs and ancient threats you might dig up. They’ll help protect your miners proactively, but you can also build traps and turrets to scare off enemies and defend your static base. It's a sort of Dungeon Keeper lite, where the threats generally aren't threats at all until you dig them up on purpose, letting you take on fights at your own pace – at least, at first. That's on top of a welcome range of difficulty settings that can make enemies anything from pushovers to a real, consistent threat. That’s a strong design decision for the kind of lowkey city builder SteamWorld Build is, where disruptive attacks could end up feeling more annoying than challenging. The fact that it uses enemies as speed bumps to smooth out the pace of progression instead of a constant gauntlet to worry about is nice. As you dig and build, the train station aboveground also gets regular visits from out-of-towners. In classic old west fashion, this is a source of both money and things you can't otherwise make yourself: Building upgrades. Most buildings have an open slot or two to boost them, such as warehouses getting more storage space and workers to haul goods, resource producers getting a chance to make bonus items, or even just new picks and guns for the bots in the mines. You can also trade away excess goods for cash, which is nice. These upgrades are very simple, not complex enough to provide diverse build strategies to each new run, but they support your experience in a key way: If you don't enjoy figuring out ideal production rates, for example, you can just invest in bonus production and not think about your underperforming cactus juice farms ever again. From start to finish, it only took me about eight hours to build a town, excavate the mines, and construct a rocket to escape SteamWorld. This is a quick and simple city builder, which is both its greatest strength and what holds it back from being so much more. There are five maps with different terrain to work around, but the decisions you have to make while doing so aren’t otherwise going to change very much. You'll build the same stuff every time with little variation. Making your way through the production chain and exploring those maps is plenty of fun – but it's just the one kind of fun, not a deep and engaging puzzle that unfolds and draws you deeper over time. It does get a lot of beginner-friendliness and approachability from its decision to embrace simplicity. That's evident, for example, in the fact that developer The Station has actually managed to deliver competent controller support, unlike a lot of other city builders that only vaguely succeed at it. That's not to say there aren't any unpredictable elements or new things to unlock and do the longer you play, either. Each map can be played with a randomly generated underground layer, which is a nice touch that keeps the mine-building fresh. Beating a map also unlocks a permanent upgrade to future towns' infrastructure, like a boosted train station that has shipments come more often. Nothing too special, but it is a bit of a victory lap that cuts down on busywork that'd be annoying to repeat. It's also a space-saving convenience that frees up time to make your towns pretty with decorations. Nothing like a neatly-appointed rail line to keep up steambot morale. SteamWorld Build is an enjoyable little city builder that doesn't give you grindy busywork or overstretch itself with bloated padding, focusing on a solid foundation of laying out a city and providing it with supplies. Its underground layer is a cool additional system that has you expanding, improving, and defending your mining operation in a way that matches the laid back pace of the surface nicely. At the same time, SteamWorld Build’s simplicity cuts both ways, and there isn’t much variety on return trips aside from fitting the old bits into new maps. That makes it a refreshing city builder worthy of a few fun weekends, but not a particularly deep one I’m likely to boot up year after year. "
3,Bluey: The Videogame ,4.0,"The very same weekend we received Bluey: The Videogame, Australia’s ABC broadcasted a countdown of the top 100 Bluey episodes, as voted by the public. Tuning in for the final 20-or-so, it was the perfect opportunity to catch up with any of the very best ones I’d managed to miss over the years ahead of this review. One of those was Onesies, and I was floored when the theme was revealed. Seriously, the ability of this children’s show to tackle a concept as complex as infertility for an audience of any age, and with such an expert balance of levity and empathy, is nothing short of remarkable. There is so much to this show beneath the surface. I do wish I could say the same about Bluey: The Videogame – that it, too, is quite remarkable in its own way. Unfortunately, it is not. It may look like a spot-on recreation of Bluey’s gorgeous and distinct 2D animation, but beneath the surface there isn’t much more than an hour or so of mild multiplayer fun and moderate frustration. As I’ve touched on, Bluey the show is a rare breed; colourful and cute enough to entertain its core audience of preschoolers, witty enough to hook older kids and deliver valuable lime lessons without ever patronising either audience, and regularly profound enough to make their parents cry. On a more superficial level, though, it’s rare because it’s also beautifully animated in 2D. While I admit I probably don’t quite have my finger on the pulse of pre-schooler TV these days, if it’s still anything like it was a few years back this is in stark contrast to most shows for four-year-olds – which tend to look like time capsules of PS1 game cutscenes exhumed from 1997.  Bluey: The Videogame does an admittedly terrific job of emulating the bright and chunky look of the show, and it effectively converts the four available backdrops into 2.5D environments that bring depth to places like the Heeler home without jarring with the show’s usual look (which is typically staged on a single plane). The characters and animations are equally accurate, and they’re more or less indistinguishable from the show itself. It helps a lot that the cast is also aboard to provide the voices. Unfortunately, that’s largely where the good stuff stops. Perhaps the biggest problem of all is the absurdly short length for what isn’t some two-dollar tablet game you download on a whim to keep a toddler busy while you’re waiting for your spring rolls. At £35 in the UK, $60 Australian, and $40 US, it is brazenly expensive for a game that can be completed in under an hour, and picked clean of collectables in less than two. We try to keep price out of the conversation in a review because games don’t get better when they go on sale, but exceptions must be made in cases like this where it’s just a ripoff. There are just four maps – the Heeler house and backyard, the playground, the creek, and the beach – and a short story arc split into four 10- to 15-minute episodes. Developer Artax Games has divided the Heeler backyard and house in the menu to make it appear there are five maps, but that’s not the case; obviously, the house and backyard are connected. It is a tiny amount amount of extremely modestly sized maps. No shops, no succulent Chinese restaurants, no school, no Hammerbarn – it’s the bare minimum all the way. The setup is cute enough; it’s the school holidays and Bluey and Bingo are spending it on the hunt for a forgotten treasure buried by Bandit and his brothers when they were kids. As such, there are appearances by Uncle Stripe and Muffin, Uncle Rad, plus Chilli’s father Grandad Mort. There’s even a low-hanging moral brushed against in the fourth and final episode, which culminates at the creek, but then the story just… ends. The beach is unlocked, but there’s no story component here – even though there feels like there should be. It just doesn’t actually feel finished. It doesn’t feel particularly well-finished when it comes to how it plays, either. I played through in co-op with my kids and our experience was mostly fractured, finicky, and frustrating. There were times our characters were frozen and only returning to the character screen to re-select our characters would fix it. Lining up objects to interact with and pick up is a hassle, which is doubly annoying considering the solution to every puzzle is pushing or pulling a piece of furniture. Or maybe a rock. Platforming is imprecise and inelegant in the 2.5D spaces, and while it does seem to only need one of you to succeed, this is a pain in groups of three or four players. In bigger groups, progression is messy – it’s really just a melee of everybody spamming the interact button to gather junk and getting teleported along by the first person to successfully make a few jumps. Each of the four episodes also introduces a separate minigame that can be started and played from a dedicated game wheel, including Keepy Uppy (keeping a balloon off the ground, which is dreadfully underwhelming in practice), the platforming-based Ground is Lava (which had a habit of trapping me in a glitched state where I couldn’t move), Magic Xylophone (which is basically freeze tag with an extraneous musical instrument), and Chattermax Chase (which is essentially Baby’s First Oddball. You kids know what Halo is, right?). Unfortunately, these minigames are scrappy and rudimentary at best, and we really didn’t find ourselves drawn back to any of them. If anything, we gleaned the most fun out of exploring the Heeler home in free-roam and hunting through all the recognisable rooms, but even that was short lived. With 151 episodes of Bluey in the can, the list of places and pooches Bluey: The Videogame could’ve featured is extensive. What we have feels like barely half a game. It’s a bewilderingly unimaginative take on the most canny, creative, and considered kids show I’ve ever seen, and it’s extremely trifficult to recommend. Wedged somewhere between Wi-Fi and The Wiggles as one of Australia’s greatest exports, Bluey has been a staggeringly successful animated series. Tens of billions of minutes of the show have been streamed into households in more than 60 countries, and the Heelers have subsequently been transformed into over 1,000 bits of merchandising tat. In an unfortunate turn of events, Bluey: The Videogame feels a lot like another forgettable piece of the latter, hovering somewhere between the countless toys and the tubes of licensed toothpaste. Low on innovation and high on what feels like contractual obligation, Bluey: The Videogame is really a low-effort mobile game masquerading as a mid-price console and PC product. It may absolutely look the part compared to the show itself, but with its assortment of shallow minigames rife with annoying bugs, frustrating controls, and a bafflingly brief runtime of a little over an hour, everywhere else it’s a dog’s breakfast.

4,Naruto x Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections ,5.0,"Like the four Ultimate Ninja Storm games before it, Naruto x Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections is a comprehensive ode to the world and characters created by Masashi Kishimoto. Its immense cast of playable characters, each with exceptionally well-animated movesets, and a heaping handful of maps ripped straight from the anime with loving detail look better than ever before. But no level of source material accuracy can save this absolute mammoth of a game from hollow single-player content and a stale combat system that hasn’t meaningfully changed in fifteen years. As far as Naruto fans go, I’m a bit of a weirdo. I was actually first introduced to the series ten years ago through Ultimate Ninja Storm 3, and I still vividly remember marveling at that entry’s shockingly big roster compared to most fighting games. That spurred me to get caught up with the show, and then I found myself further hooked thanks to the story mode’s faithful recreation of that fictional world. But while I stayed a Naruto fan, my friends and I eventually moved on to games with more depth, like Super Smash Bros. That’s because in order to support a roster that’s aptly described as a literal storm of ninjas, the combat has to stay pretty simple. This makes it approachable and easy to master, but there’s also no pot of gold to chase at the end of this learning curve like there is in better fighting games.  Combos flow like a watered-down version of Devil May Cry or Bayonetta; you can add variations to your moves, but most of the time you’ll be pressing the single attack button until your combo ends with a flashy finisher – unless you’re quick enough to cancel it into a special move or a dash before rinsing and repeating. Combo finishers usually end by launching your opponent across the map into the ground, putting them out of reach from a follow-up dash. This is where the real game begins: you’ll need to master and understand the ebb and flow of blocking, attacking, grabbing, and moving to get up close and personal so you can lock your opponent into yet another devastating flurry of blows. Most of the characters in these games are (unsurprisingly) ninjas, which means they’re highly agile and each have three magic abilities to show off in the heat of battle. Just about anything goes here: Kiba teams up with his trusty pooch Akamaru to rush down and drill his opponents into a pulp, Kisame shoots shark-shaped water bombs from a safe distance, and Raikage Ay slams with thunderous force, creating a massive shockwave. But the drawback of that shared ninja DNA is that, aside from the stray puppet user like Chiyo or Sasori, most characters draw their movesets from the same small pool – albeit with different coats of paint. With 130 playable characters (though many of them are duplicates of main characters, with one or more extra variations of the same person taking up a lot of real estate), choosing a character based on their playstyle is less important than choosing a character you like from the show. That roster sounds impressive, but it actually feels barren as a fan, with only a few characters from Boruto, most of whom are just grown-up versions of other playable fighters. For something that’s billed as a definitive celebration of the whole series, Ninja Storm Connections falls disappointingly short. Playstyles are generally so similar too that you could swap most characters’ voice lines and models with another and not see a huge difference. That said, using each character to their fullest potential takes a lot of savvy resource management and patient play, which is where Ninja Storm games shine. Using these special techniques consumes chakra, the Naruto series’ life-granting spiritual essence. On top of that, you’ll also need to keep an eye on your substitution gauge, which allows your character to escape any combo or attack at the push of a button. But you only have four substitutions at your disposal, and using multiple will cause your gauge to refill very slowly. This all adds some extra sauce to the otherwise one-note combat as players dash and jump all over its 3D arenas. Ninja Storm Connections seeks to further streamline the series’ combat for people who want a more forgiving fighting system by adding in the Simple control mode. By pressing a single button, your character will control itself, deciding when to dash, use special moves, and execute combos, leaving you to simply move and block. It’s great for people who love the show but aren’t into fighting games, but not something that will ever match up to an experienced player. It’s also highly customizable, allowing you to select what’s automated and what isn’t. Playing online has been pretty smooth thus far – though results will vary depending on your own and your opponent’s internet connection strengths and speeds since Ninja Storm Connections disappointingly doesn’t use rollback netcode like a majority of other contemporary fighting games do, instead opting for a peer-to-peer connection. In most cases, this makes for a less reliable option that often results in a worse online experience. Netcode aside, the multiplayer options offer a solid range of online features including multiple opponent rating systems, with fail-safes for players who disconnect during a match or engage in toxic behavior. For a fighting game with such broad appeal, that’s a fantastic approach to curbing the poor behavior that permeates a lot of the casual arena fighting genre. Its single-player story options, on the other hand, are something of a letdown. The History Mode lets you poorly relive the story of Naruto and friends from the beginning of the original series, which follows him as a kid through the end of Naruto Shippuden three years later. Special Story Mode, on the other hand, is a predictable and rarely exciting original story written by series creator Masashi Kishimoto set in the time of Naruto’s son, Boruto, whose own manga series is still ongoing. I love the world and story of Naruto. Its complex politics, incredibly fleshed-out history, well-defined characters with rich backgrounds, and interweaving relationships are the foundation of why this series has remained so popular over the years. Unfortunately, Ninja Storm Connections’ approach to that story does it no favors. Parsed out like a half-baked flashback, History Mode truncates the events of Naruto and Shippuden in slapdash fashion. Yes, these games are designed with the fans in mind and most of the people playing through its roughly seven-hour recap will probably already know these events like the back of their hand, but that doesn’t excuse shoddy storytelling. Instead of cutscenes, subtitled stills from the anime pop up in-between the occasional fight, with sound effects like clashing kunai and some sporadic screen-shaking as the only attempts to add flavor. I’m sure it’s challenging to condense entire arcs spanning dozens of episodes into roughly 40-minute-long chapters, but I’m equally sure it could’ve been done in a more interesting way than this. These “movies,” as the game refers to them, are narrated by the Naruto world’s god-like figure, The Sage of Six Paths. This detached perspective, delivered in English via voice actor Michael McConnohie’s hypnotic rasp, is great in a vacuum, but boring in the broader context of a series that involves so many distinct characters and performances by talented voice actors. And that’s if a given movie is fortunate enough to have any voiceover whatsoever. You’ll rarely hear from the actual characters involved in these moments, which play out more like YouTube lore videos than interesting scenes. Instead, whenever a memorable quote comes up, our disembodied narrator reads it like he’s a teacher reading a book to a group of kindergarteners. In the same way that a poorly-placed repeated flashback can deflate the tension of an intense moment in an anime, so too can a comically offbeat line read. This isn’t through any fault of the narrator’s performance – he’s doing his best with what’s been given to him. This is a fault that sweeps this entire mode’s framing, which is just not a good way to retell this show. That’s especially true compared to past games, which saw you take a much more active role in playing out these stories. In the case of the first three Ninja Storm games, you controlled a character through an entire open overworld that represented a smaller-scale version of the shinobi world where Naruto is set. It helped reinforce the sense of place that makes the world of Naruto so noteworthy. Layering extra side missions and hidden collectibles on top of that open world further established the sense that you were actually part of it, not just looking on as a passive observer who occasionally picks up a controller to shoot out a Rasengan. That all changed in Ninja Storm 4, and Connections picks the disappointing mantle right back up. All side objectives and collectibles now come in the form of samey battle objectives, which include a very limited range of tasks like ending a battle with a certain amount of your health bar remaining or finishing your opponent off with a specific type of move. Considering just how many battles you compete in throughout Ninja Storm Connections’ single-player content, you’re likely to see every possible special challenge within the first hour or so. Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 refines the gameplay to the absolute best of the series and offers a large roster of playable characters. Unfortunately, it squanders all of that potential with a short and poorly presented campaign fought against buggy AI, a forgettable Adventure Mode and online matches that are plagued with connectivity problems. - Jakejames Lugo, February 9, 2016Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 review. Reducing the History Mode down to dialogue sequences with random fights was bad enough in the last Ninja Storm game, but Connections adds insult to injury by passing up the opportunity to retell Boruto’s story in order to spend time on a middling side adventure instead. Part of the Special Story mode is set within ‘Ninja Heroes,’ a fictional, in-universe video game based on the characters and events of Naruto, and that’s where things really go off the rails. It’s an online multiplayer game where Boruto and all of his friends gather to hang out; think Fortnite if it featured skins based on war heroes instead of Master Chief and Chun-Li, but for this fictional world. There’s almost no discernible story in Ninja Heroes, and the only thing Boruto &amp; company do in it is fight – but you’re not even forced to use these newbies. In fact, you could play most of this mode’s fights as any character you want because the full base roster is available. Peeling away the layers behind this game’s existence only adds to the confusion; for example, one of Boruto’s friends makes his in-game avatar that of Deidara – a former member of the Akatsuki, a murderous terrorist organization that was responsible for killing droves of people – and nobody bats an eye. It’s as confusing as it is strange, but never strange enough to be compelling. Ninja Heroes is quickly revealed to be a Trojan Horse that’s part of a greater plan to take over the world, but there’s just nothing interesting about it until the characters leave this digital space and realize something’s amiss. It’s about as silly as it sounds, and mostly just acts as an excuse to toss loads of purposeless fights at you for a large chunk of this story. In fact, there’s even a section that tries to make fun of how unapproachable and content-dense some MMOs can be by throwing a long series of fights at you, but the joke misses its mark and inadvertently becomes the very thing that it sets out to make fun of. Part of what makes the fights in other Ninja Storm story modes so fun is re-living the dramatic character moments that bookend these same fights in the anime and manga. Playing a bad fictional video game that doesn’t have a story as a part of real life video game’s paper-thin story mode is about as dry as you’d expect. Thankfully, this side adventure doesn’t swan dive headfirst into that empty swimming pool. Instead, it does eventually get somewhere more interesting, with real stakes, political intrigue, and plots to plunge the world into warring chaos, but its first third is such a painfully dull slog that nothing can truly redeem it. One bright spot opposed to the History Mode, however, is that characters are fully voiced, and there are several well-animated cutscenes. The opening one, in particular, is a stunning display that cleverly left me excited to see more. Seeing Naruto and Sasuke fighting is nothing new, but using it as a way to set up a mystery involving a role reversal between the two, with Naruto seemingly turning coat, left me wondering more about where this story was going and how things had led to that point. I just wish it never dropped that initial sense of action and intrigue. Naruto x Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections may have the biggest roster and flashiest graphics in the series, but its unenthusiastic re-telling of the source material in what should be a celebration of Naruto, Shippuden, and Boruto falls flat. Even when it’s fun and nostalgic, there’s almost nothing here to make me seek it out over past entries with basically the same fighting system and better single-player stories. If all you want is the newest, biggest, and shiniest way to watch your favorite shinobi battle it out, Ninja Storm Connections at least delivers that. But just because it understands the assignment doesn’t mean its execution gets high marks. Even as someone who dabbles in annual series like Call of Duty and FIFA with friends from time to time, this is the most “just another one of these” games I’ve played in a long time. "
5,Super Mario RPG ,8.0,"Odds are good you’ve seen Mario stomp a goomba or kick a koopa shell before, but you might not have seen him punch a giant lady with a parrot for hair right in the shins while she sips a cocktail and rides a floating banana. Super Mario RPG is easily one of the quirkiest adventures the mustachioed plumber has ever been on, rightly becoming a standout when Final Fantasy developer Square first released it nearly three decades ago. Its 2023 remake is an incredibly faithful recreation of that already awesome RPG, with a fresh coat of paint and some small but smart combat updates. Those changes can’t completely shake off 27 years of dust, but they do provide a fantastic way for fans like me to revisit this classic while also letting new folk better enjoy just how wild it is firsthand. Bucking the usual setup, this entertaining story kicks off with Mario rushing to Bowser’s keep and immediately rescuing a kidnapped Princess Peach – but before they can return home happily ever after, a giant sword with a face crashes through the castle roof and sends all three of them flying. From there, Mario has to fight lots of living weapons up to no good and collect seven Star Pieces in order to save the Mushroom Kingdom. It’s not a long tale, taking me just about 12 hours to finish (though I’ve done so on SNES before), but the writing is so consistently funny and often off-the-wall that this essentially-unchanged script still had me frequently laughing out loud.  Super Mario RPG’s turn-based combat is extremely straightforward, pitting your party of five against all sorts of weird and creative enemies – from your standard Mario monsters like goombas to the skeletal corpse of a mastodon that has literally zero explanation. It fuses timing-based button prompts into your otherwise recognizable mix of basic attacks and resource-limited spells, satisfyingly giving you an extra boost for a well-timed A-press on offense and reducing damage (or even negating it entirely) on defense. This system still rocks, and it’s easy to see why it influenced so many games that came after it – be that Mario’s own RPG outings in the Mario &amp; Luigi and Paper Mario games, or more recent successors like the South Park RPGs or this year’s Sea of Stars. That said, it’s worth mentioning that while it’s always very fun, combat is also borderline comically fast a lot of the time, sending you into super-easy fights just as quickly as you’re likely to finish them, with the really interesting encounters reserved for a fairly wide array of inventive bosses. That includes a strange sort of dog monster that creates clones of your party members, as well as a living bow who cleverly disables buttons on your controller to prevent specific types of moves, shaking battles up nicely even if they still don’t usually pose much of a threat. Combat is also definitely the place this remake has been altered most substantially, largely for the better. Button timings now give an even bigger bonus for a super-precise press, even adding a splash damage effect to your basic attacks that made me more thoughtful about how I distributed damage in standard encounters than I ever was in the original. Chaining together well-timed presses also fills up a gauge to use on powerful new Triple Moves, each of which comes with an awesome 3D cutscene. These updates don’t necessarily make the combat feel as modern or as deep as many of the games inspired by the original, but they do help breathe plenty of fresh life into a system that certainly benefits from it. One part of that system that is still a ton of fun is its varied selection of weapons. Rather than only being a statistical increase, the weapons each of your party members use are tailored specifically to them, and their animations – and, as a result, attack timings – change whenever you find a new one. Mario could be kicking a koopa shell or smashing baddies with a hammer, while the totally lovable “tadpole” Mallow can go from swinging a stick to crashing together cymbals. Bowser (who rounds out your party alongside the mysterious Geno and Princess Peach herself) has probably the best weapon option: a glove that lets him pick up and hurl Mario as a projectile like Colossus tossing Wolverine. I loved that each time I switched weapons I had to retrain my muscle memory, which is made easier here by a smart new prompt that guides your timing only until you nail it a few times (and then comes back if you start to slip). The rub of this extremely amusing weapon system, however, is that you don’t have much control over it. This is a very linear game, and each new weapon you find will almost always just be statistically better than the last, with no comparable alternatives to choose from. That’s true of your defensive items too, leaving the RPG part of Super Mario RPG a little bit thin as you don’t really customize your characters much past a single accessory slot for things like small stat boosts or status resistances. Instead, the lifeblood of this campaign is its variety – it’s easy to enjoy some fairly simple combat and progression when you’re never in the same setting long enough to ever come near getting bored. You’ll jump from classic Mario sewers to a ghost-filled sunken pirate ship, from a minigame where you’re barrelling down a waterfall collecting coins to one where you’re running up a hill trying to save Princess Peach, from fighting a crazed bomb person to a living wedding cake. This world could so easily have crumbled into a hodgepodge of disparate ideas, especially when you occasionally remember that this is somehow still a Mario game, but instead they come together to make a strangely coherent and delightfully unique whole. All of the things I mentioned and more have been lovingly recreated with true 3D graphics faithful to the original’s pre-rendered 3D art style, and the new look is… I dunno, it’s fine. I don’t mean to undersell what this remake has done, it really does look quite nice, especially in its brand-new and often super-cool cutscenes – but I can’t help but feel like some amount of the original’s personality has been lost in the translation here. Models and environments are updated almost one-to-one, leaving them looking shiny and new, but removing some of the charm the pre-rendered look naturally had. When I look at other Switch remakes, like Link’s Awakening or Live A Live, I end up wishing this one had found a bit of its own flavor inspired by that SNES look rather than just making the closest approximation it could manage. One area that has been masterfully modernized, however, is the soundtrack. Super Mario RPG’s music has been burned into my brain since childhood, and while the rose-tinted glasses that come with that adoration initially had me thinking the updated versions were just okay, all it took was swapping between new and old (which you can conveniently do at will in the menu) for me to appreciate just how great these new tracks are. They are perfectly reverent while adding impressive layers of instrumentation and nuance to every song, capturing their spirits and all the little accents that make them so catchy while bringing something new to the table in the exact way I wished the graphics had. And speaking of new, this isn’t just the adventure oldies like me might remember. The base campaign has remained relatively untouched in terms of content, but an entirely new post-game lets you explore for secrets you may have missed after the credits roll, while also including some impressive extra challenges to push your limits. Avoiding any specific spoilers, that includes extremely clever twists on some fights that require a deeper use of the combat system and its various mechanics in a way I appreciated. I sort of wish these encounters hadn’t been saved exclusively for an endgame grind, but I like that the added difficulty is there for those left hungry by the main story. There’s also a comprehensive Monster List to fill out, with checkmarks and funny little quotes for every enemy you manage to successfully time Mallow’s Thought Peek ability on, giving me a completionist goal to chase even as combat got overly easy. However, this list exposes perhaps the most surprising issue with Super Mario RPG’s remake: about a third of the way through the campaign, the menus started suffering from serious framerate drops that made everything from shops to equipment juggling to that exhaustive Monster List a chore to navigate. I didn’t run into any technical issues besides this (apart from some similar lag in one specific map area), but it was bad enough that I actively disliked managing my party, checking my items, or revisiting all of those silly quotes I had collected, which is a bit of a bummer. Super Mario RPG is considered a classic for a reason, and this wonderfully faithful remake makes it easy for anyone who missed it in the SNES era to see why. It’s unabashedly odd, reveling in the unexpected with writing that constantly had me bursting out laughing at jokes I’d heard a dozen times before. Its turn-based combat is fairly simple outside of its very clever boss fights, but it’s also ultra satisfying to keep your timing string going even when you’re plowing through pushovers. And while the updated graphics are equal parts pretty and sort of unambitious when it comes to interpreting the original’s style (with some unfortunate menu lag), the new takes on its excellent music are truly exceptional. Super Mario RPG already held up pretty well if you didn’t mind a bit of dust on its different systems, but now there’s no excuse not to see why Mario’s most unexpected adventure is still so beloved. "
6,Persona 5 Tactica ,8.0,"Persona 5 Royal is the kind of complete experience that left me wanting for nothing, and so I have some mixed feelings about its spinoff games. And Persona 5 Tactica, which moves the groovy action to a satisfying grid-based combat system, doesn't fully succeed in making me feel the way the original, epic JRPG did. But still, it's nice to get to see some of my favorite characters again. And Atlus' combat designers have shown that their skill at making fast-paced, punchy battles that reward clever planning translates nicely to the turn-based tactics genre. In terms of the timeline, Tactica takes place between the second and third semesters of Persona 5 Royal. And I definitely would not recommend picking it up if you haven't played at least that far into the story. For one, the in-game encyclopedia contains some fairly huge spoilers for Royal. And for another, it doesn't really spend much time introducing you to the characters or the concept of the otherworldly Metaverse. I can only imagine someone coming into this adventure with no previous Persona knowledge would wind up highly confused.   The art style took a little bit of warming up to, as well. The entire cast has been partially chibi-fied, if that's the correct term – though Morgana, hilariously, doesn't really look much different. That threw me off at first, but eventually I more or less stopped noticing. The art direction is definitely very Persona 5, from the menu screens to the mysterious, sprawling Kingdoms that take the place of palaces this time around. Leblanc looks a bit too bright and cheery; I barely recognized it. But all the new friends and foes show off the sort of zany imagination I've come to expect from this universe. And of course, you can't call yourself a Persona 5 game without a hard rocking, energetic, jazzy soundtrack. Composer Toshiki Konishi pulled me back into those immaculate vibes immediately with toe-tapping new tracks for hanging out at the hideout, investigating strange new worlds, and general ass-kicking. Vocalist Lyn Inaizumi is back as well, with some memorable performances, including a new boss fight track. These jams aren't quite on the level of  ""Beneath the Mask"" or ""Rivers in the Desert"" from the main game. But what is, right? Overall, I was impressed with Altus' ability to translate the feel of the Persona combat system to a tactics game as well. Every turn is still about trying to set up combos, but now you'll be darting around the battlefield, taking cover, pushing or luring out enemies, and finishing with a flashy team-up maneuver. It's engaging in a lot of the same ways traditional Persona JRPG battles are, in that you can't get far simply by charging in and focusing your strongest attacks on the first thing you see. Success takes observation, planning, and experimentation. The ability to rewind to your previous turn is very welcome, too. At first, I was afraid it would make things too easy. But each of these missions is pretty short to begin with, rarely taking more than 10 minutes, so even starting all the way over isn't terrible. And being able to change up your plan from the moment you knew it went wrong just cuts back on repeating the same exact moves multiple times, since enemy behavior doesn't seem to have any randomness. Rather than specific enemies having strengths and weaknesses to certain elements, every attack type in Tactica inflicts a status effect that usually has to do with movement. Wind spells push the target a long distance away from the caster. Psy abilities lure the enemy toward you. Gravity can pull a group of enemies toward a specific point. I found lots of interesting ways to use these in combination to set up big combos, since Tactica's version of an all-out attack requires you to basically draw a triangle around multiple enemies with your three party members. But the downside of this approach is that some elements are simply better than others. Fire feels very underpowered, for instance, since it doesn't have a movement effect and you'll never run into an enemy that's weak to it. Sorry, Ann, you're on the bench for this one. I also wish there were more finishers available. Party customization is definitely much simpler than a mainline Persona game, but it's still fairly extensive. The only equipment you can upgrade are guns, with melee damage increasing automatically as your party levels up. But there are well over 100 fusible Personas to unlock and, for the first time, anyone can equip them as a ""sub-Persona,"" not just Joker. So if you want to give Panther a gravity spell… looks like you're back on the varsity squad! Everyone will still be best at a certain thing, though, since they can only upgrade their main element through personalized skill trees. Persona 5 was already a strong front-runner for being the best JRPG ever made, and Royal really gets me wondering what else could even compete. The excellent story and its lovable, multidimensional characters along with the challenging, tactical combat are all refined and back for another round with new surprises and new friends in tow. There are new areas to explore and new twists to leave your jaw on the floor. Very little has been left untouched, and just about everything that has been touched is better off for it. The Phantom Thieves have stolen my heart all over again, and I don’t really want it back.  Joining the familiar cast of Phantom Thieves is Erina, a fiery freedom fighter from this new corner of the Metaverse. The writing for some of the other characters feels a bit stiff, and without social links to give me mechanical rewards for dialogue choices, I really felt how long I spent in overly-wordy conversation scenes. It's way more chatter than would have been needed to tell this story effectively, and a lot of it comes off as meaningless filler. But Erina is a high point, with newcomer Leeanna Albanese bringing depth and determination to the revolutionary leader. The story takes a while to get going, but it eventually builds up to some interesting philosophical questions as it explores a different kind of cognitive world over the course of about 40 hours. If you're familiar with the basics of the Persona series, I don't think it will take you too long to figure out roughly what's going on. But the journey is still worth it, with each of the kingdoms you'll conquer offering a memorably malevolent ruler, a distinct visual style, and varied tactical encounters. I especially liked some of the Fire Emblem-style side quests, which feature one or two characters and must be completed with a set of unique restrictions, like getting across a large map while only taking damage twice.  The boss fights, on the other hand, I found a bit disappointing. While they're normally a highlight of Persona games, putting your skills to the ultimate test in unique ways, the ones in Tactica didn't really make me sweat. It's usually pretty obvious what you need to do to win. Sometimes you're even told the solution outright. And rarely did I feel like I had to put my squad in serious danger to execute that dance. The Shin Megami Tensei franchise is known for its difficulty – that's part of what I like so much about it. But Tactica just isn't on that same level, even if you're going for all of the optional bonus objectives on every map. It's also missing a meaningful resource management angle, since there's no ticking clock on the campaign, you have fewer tough choices about what to do with your hard-earned cash, and you get back all of your SP after each battle. When all is said and done, I had a really good time with Persona 5 Tactica. It's a smaller, easier, less epic experience than its JRPG big brother, but none of that spoils the adventure too much. The combat is quick, clever, and exciting, even if – along with the writing and art style – it seems geared toward younger players or an overall more casual experience. Getting to spend another 40-some hours with my beloved Shujin classmates and bob my head along to some of the best music in video games is well worth my time. Long live the revolution! "
7,Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 ,9.0,"It’s nothing short of a miracle that a sequel as well-made as Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 managed to arrive just two years after the original. Developer Fair Play Labs’ second attempt at a Nickelodeon-based platform fighter is a massive leap forward from the first, with a more polished feel, more vibrant characters, and the coup de grace: its envelope-pushing Slime meter. It took me a minute to get comfortable with its slightly buffered movement and wildly expressive Slime mechanics, but after a handful of late nights with friends – both online and off – I couldn’t put it down. While comparisons to the Super Smash Bros. series can cast an obnoxious shadow over this genre, it’s not an exaggeration to say that the only other platform-fighting sequel to improve, rework, and refine what came before it to this impressive degree was the legendary Super Smash Bros. Melee itself. I’ve spent literally thousands of hours in platform fighters like Super Smash Bros. and Rivals of Aether, and  classic Nickelodeon cartoons like Spongebob SquarePants and Avatar: The Last Airbender are some of my all-time favorite shows – so I was very disappointed by how much I didn’t like the original All-Star Brawl in 2021. It had the usual platform-fighting structure of damaging up your opponent before knocking them off the screen for a kill, but the animations and sound design were flat, it didn’t seem particularly polished, and most of the characters felt the same. Deeper than that, I found it mechanically unrewarding, with poorly tuned movement that prioritized hollow speed over precision. Instead of weaving a combo together based on my opponent’s damage, the attacks at my disposal, and my position on the stage, I felt more incentivized to string together the same busted attack over and over again until I could spike my poor opponent into the blast zone.  Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is a very respectable platform fighter that serves as a fun, though far less polished and less fully featured alternative to its competition. The characters and stages feel soulless without the iconic Nickelodeon voice acting and music of its source shows, but All-Star Brawl lands its hits where it matters the most: in the fights themselves. If you can look past its underwhelming audio and visuals to see the surprisingly nuanced fighter just beneath the fog of nostalgia, then you’ll find some real treasure in this pineapple under the sea. - Mitchell Saltzman, Oct 7, 2021Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl review. It’s incredible, then, that All-Star Brawl 2 takes nearly every frustration and complaint I had with the first one and inverts them. Combos are deeper and more fleshed out thanks to multiple revamped mechanics, hits feel more substantial and satisfying thanks to beefed up sound design and improved animations, and movement strikes a much better balance between speed and precision. And perhaps most exciting of all, its excellent cast of characters shine thanks to their updated, more cartoony models and well-acted voice lines delivered by many of their original voice actors. Fanservice and nostalgia are often wielded with all the tact of an ill-fated Krabby Patty secret formula attempt – using them as seasoning, rather than the main ingredient, is almost always important. Not so in a crossover fighting game, however. Games like Marvel vs. Capcom and Super Smash Bros. rightly revel in nostalgia, and All-Star Brawl 2 similarly dives straight into the deep end. Every animation and attack for every single character cleverly references something from the original cartoon shows. For example, SpongeBob’s neutral weak aerial is a pose he does during the radical Goofy Goober Rock scene from The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, Ren and Stimpy throw out the iconic Log from their show’s parody commercials, and Aang rides around on his signature ball of air. But these referential movesets aren’t just hollow, with most characters having different gameplans, specialized meters, and other bespoke mechanics that add a fun, necessary level of diversity. SpongeBob, All-Star Brawl 2’s all-around character, is pretty good at everything, but isn’t especially strong at one particular thing more than any other fighter, and he’s a bit floatier in his movement. Compare that to the devastating damage and heavy-hitting combos of Reptar and the difference is clear, with momentum-based movement that feels like controlling a hulking dinosaur should – but that raw power means you won’t have a prayer when you’re trying to get back on the stage. Meanwhile, Garfield has a decent combo game, but doesn’t have many reliable options for killing until his lasagna meter (yes, you read that correctly) gets filled up and he becomes faster and stronger. It’s hard for me to talk about the different ways characters function without going on an overexcited rant about each and every one because they all offer something unique and interesting. Where it took me forever to pick a main in the previous game because I just couldn’t find a character that stood out to me, it’s taken me a long time to find one in All-Star Brawl 2 because I like so much of its cast. After putting every fighter through the motions in the single-player Arcade mode, I found myself excited to explore a whopping half of its 26 characters further. I can’t remember the last time I was this torn and this excited to spend time playing as such a wide swath of different characters in a platform fighter. This is the kind of diverse cast that puts a fighting game into the next stratosphere. Zim is a puppet character now and has the ability to control Gir with greater accuracy, the Angry Beavers work less like Ice Climbers and more like a team from a tag-based 2D fighter with moves that may remind you of some well-known assists from games like Dragon Ball FighterZ, and Plankton is a weird mix between a grappler and a zoner with ranged grabs and wonky projectiles. That cast hasn’t come without sacrifices, though. Not only have a handful of favorites from the previous game been cut, including CatDog and Toph Beifong, but it’s a little weird to see main characters from their own series not show up. Grandma Gertie and Gerald from Hey, Arnold! are playable, for example, but Arnold himself is nowhere to be seen. The same goes for Reptar standing in for any of the Rugrats. While I can understand why that might frustrate some, these choosier omissions leave room for All-Star Brawl 2’s cast to have more diverse playstyles. Reptar is one of the game’s few heavy characters, and both Grandma Gertie and Gerald’s movesets bring a lot of distinct, cool flair to the cast in a way that feels worth the trade-off. While new characters may get the spotlight, even the returning cast brings something fresh and new to the brawl. Fair Play Labs has fully rebuilt every aspect of this sequel, so no character is the same as they were in the previous game. This huge rework may sound like overkill, but it’s a necessary step in making every fighter work with the new Slime mechanic, All-Star Brawl 2’s greatest innovation. I cannot overstate how much style and finesse Slime adds to this game. With just a single button press and a sufficiently filled Slime meter, you can add extra power to any of your special moves, boost your air dodge, cancel out of freefall after using your recovery, boost that recovery further, cancel out of any move’s ending animations, and even escape enemy combos. Versatile, easy to manage, and well-balanced, Slime is an effective tool no matter what character you’re playing or how good you are at All-Star Brawl 2. Slime also grants characters the ability to do a beefy ultimate attack, complete with goofy mini-cutscenes like what you might expect from a Final Smash. Cool as they are, these cutscenes do sometimes pierce the veil of All-Star Brawl 2’s otherwise strong art style. Maybe it’s the PC I’m playing on, but models and animations seem to take a dip in quality during some of these Slime attacks compared to normal gameplay. It’s not present across the board, but Aang’s super, for example, brings his model close enough to cover a good chunk of the screen. At that scale, it has a pixelated, grainy look that comes off especially rough compared to when he’s airbending across the stage. It looks like the models used for fighting are the same ones that appear in these cutscenes, but some of them don’t seem like they were designed to be seen that up-close and personal. Slime’s wide range of uses may sound overwhelming, but this mechanic blends naturally into the ebb and flow of All-Star Brawl 2’s combat, and adds an ocean of depth to the other ways it already improved combat in doing so. Mapped to one specific button, Slime takes the mechanical complexity granted by special meters that you might find in Street Fighter or Guilty Gear, and combines them with the approachability of Super Smash Bros. Heck, Slime cancels add in a little bit of the nuance that more complicated cancels bring to more traditional fighting games, but you can do them by pressing just one button. The same goes for Ex specials in a game like Street Fighter, but again, with the simpler input system found in platform fighters. This addition and its implementation are ingenious, not only as a means of adding a distinct mechanic not found in other platform fighters, but also as a way of doing so without alienating the party game ethos at the beating heart of this genre. I can confidently hand a controller to my roommate — whose last-played video game was Skyrim — and tell him that he can use Slime to beef up his special attacks confident that he’ll be able to pull it off. It slots so naturally into not just All-Star Brawl 2, but the genre as a whole, that I wouldn’t be surprised to see imitators crop up in the next few years. Lowering the barrier of entry on those more complex techniques while also adding depth makes the impossible suddenly feel possible. I’ve been playing platform fighters since before I could read, and from the moment I became good enough at them to scrape together a basic combo, I’ve always chased those tricky combo options that seem like they should work, but lie tantalizingly just out of reach. In that regard, Slime is my childhood wish fulfilled. The more time I put into All-Star Brawl 2, the more I find myself searching for the next rule I can use it to break. It’s a gripping push-and-pull that I’ve never experienced in a game like this. Slime isn’t the only new addition, though. As if to further tout its illustrious voice cast, All-Star Brawl 2 also has a Campaign mode that features even more voice actors reprising their iconic roles. The story itself isn’t much more than connective tissue written so that our favorite Nicktoons can crossover with one another thanks to Clockwork from Danny Phantom, but it does make for some fun moments. Most of the interactions I’ve found feature characters from SpongeBob encountering each other in the course of a run through this roguelite mode, but there are other surprises too. I think my favorite is an interaction where Clockwork and SpongeBob talk about whether or not Patrick has a brain. It all has the same energy you’d expect from a crossover episode during a Saturday morning cartoon block. This is where All-Star Brawl 2 takes the most direct cues from Smash Bros., incorporating themed battles and events based on the characters and stages available. Each run does a good job of rotating between different game modes to keep you on your toes and prevent even highly experienced platform-fighting fans from floating through its fights. You’ll encounter platforming challenges, fights with teams of minions, and bouts against mind-controlled members of the cast. After completing enough levels, passing through the occasional shop or upgrade area along the way (each with special guests like Hugh Neutron, Powdered Toast Man, or the cabbage vendor from Avatar), you’ll take on a boss fight against an iconic villain like Shredder or The Flying Dutchman. Like most of the other challenges found in its Campaign mode, boss fights aren’t anything too novel compared to what we’ve seen in similar games, but they’re still fun. And the upgrade systems and randomly generated nature of it help to keep things fresher than they would be otherwise. Unfortunately, this is no Hades or Slay The Spire. Running through a series of diverse challenges that put your mastery of different gameplay elements and mechanics to the test makes for a completely serviceable roguelite, but there isn’t much compelling beyond what’s already fun about All-Star Brawl 2 elsewhere. I never felt the gambling sensation that comes from balancing risk against reward in a good roguelike, where making a desperate play to get ahead might just cut a good run short. Nor did I ever get that nagging “one more time” feeling compelling me to pick away at the itchy scab left by a run gone wrong. Other single-player options include an Arcade mode, which uses the same challenge level types found in the Campaign and mashes them up with specially-themed fights, like teaming up with SpongeBob to fight Plankton. It’s a big improvement on the original All-Star Brawl’s much shorter, less curated Arcade Mode – I just wish it had more going on to distinguish it from the very comparable Campaign mode. Surprisingly, the Training mode is far and away the crown jewel of All-Star Brawl 2’s single-player options. This is probably the best training mode I’ve seen implemented in a platform fighter that doesn’t require hacking your Switch, with impressive options I’d usually expect to see in fan-made mods for training modes in other games. That includes hitbox visualization, knockback trajectories, an input display, and even frame data. It’s still years behind the training modes found in traditional fighting games that feature character-specific trials and tutorials, but it’s quite impressive for this genre. Online play is another competitive feather in All-Star Brawl 2’s cap. I haven’t been able to find any ranked matches during the pre-release review period, but online lobbies with both friends and strangers work really well thanks to its buttery-smooth rollback netcode; a must for any contemporary fighting game. I had a few problems when playing online with friends who weren’t updated to the same game version as me, and while it boggles my mind that there weren’t fail-safes for that kind of thing, it was the only issue I ran into with online play. After patching and hopping back into the fray, the gap from Chicago to Los Angeles suddenly closed and it felt so smooth that my friend might as well have been on the couch next to me. Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 finally lives up to its name, standing as an all-star platform fighter. Not only is it a fantastic sequel that takes criticisms of the first game to heart and sends them to the blast zone, it expands way beyond those adjustments. Decent (if samey) single-player options with a good amount of challenge, a training mode clearly made by people who know exactly how to construct a platform-fighting laboratory on a level rarely seen, and stellar rollback netplay bolster a supremely fun fighting system. The excellent new Slime mechanic then elevates it to a new level by introducing a huge amount of creativity to every character in its impressive roster without making it unapproachable for the party game audience. Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 belongs among the greats of the platform fighting genre – and the moment I’m done writing this, I’m going back for more. "
8,oboCop: Rogue City ,7.0,"Paul Verhoeven’s RoboCop is one of the quintessential action movies of the 1980s. It pushed the envelope with over-the-top violence, killer one-liners, and fantastic special effects, mixed with a biting anti-corporate social commentary under the surface that resonated with audiences. There have been multiple attempts to resurrect the series over the years, including an ill-fated reboot in 2014, but nothing has captured the ephemeral “it” that struck a chord when the series debuted. That’s what is most impressive about RoboCop: Rogue City: it’s not just a solid first-person shooter set in the RoboCop universe – developer Teyon absolutely nails the look and feel of its film inspiration in ways that nothing else has. It’s a good game, and the most authentic adaptation the series has ever seen.   The story itself is nothing groundbreaking: a bad guy who looks like he is fated to be thrown off the top of Naktatomi Plaza in Die Hard is up to no good, and you need to stop him. OCP is still an evil corporation, and drug-fueled gangs rule the streets. If you’ve ever seen an old-school action movie set in a city you’ll know what to expect. RoboCop himself is also treading familiar ground, with what remains of Officer Alex Murphy still struggling with figuring out the line between man and machine within himself, this time with the help of a therapist. That’s the most compelling thematic thread, and it felt like it could’ve been interesting to explore. Unfortunately, it exists exclusively in dialogue options and cutscenes, with no ramifications in gameplay. That’s too bad, as it relegates us to being an observer in his introspective crises, rather than sharing in it.  It also makes some degree of sense in that Rogue City is primarily a first-person shooter about blowing through hordes of criminal scum, but it is also smart about focusing on what makes the titular character unique. Robo (as his friends call him) is a walking tank. The slow, plodding bounce of his gate, with a heavy thunk accompanying each footfall, makes him feel like a juggernaut. The street gangs, bikers, and mercenaries that make up the bulk of the enemy fodder aren’t anywhere close to as powerful as he is, and it is so fun to walk right at these evil doers, shrugging off their small arms fire, and shredding them to literal pieces with the brap brap of Robo’s iconic Auto 9 machine-pistol. It’s exceptionally violent, as it should be. Arms and heads explode like pressurized watermelons, bodies tumble and ragdoll all around, and enemies scream about lost limbs. There are often a lot of enemies on screen at once, and turning them into a shower of crimson is a frequent and entertaining occurrence. It may not be appropriate for all ages, but it’s true to the R-rated source material, and here it is ratcheted up to a degree that is humorous and over the top rather than gratuitous and excessive. There’s a decent variety of enemies, including some that can make more than a dent in Robo, like snipers, heavy troops, and infamous big boy ED-209, and those present opportunities to get more strategic with your approach than simply charging in and busting heads. You can pick up and use guns dropped by enemies, like shotguns and assault rifles, though their ammo is limited (while Auto 9’s is not). You can also grab and throw a lot of things, like explosive barrels, motorcycles, and unlucky henchmen, which is as hilarious as it is effective.  The wonderfully destructible environment plays a key role in the combat design, too. Sometimes it’s purely aesthetic, as monitors explode, papers scatter, and shattered cement rains down from damaged structures. Other times it’s strategic, as you blast apart the cover your foes are trying to hide behind. The most exciting is the breach opportunities, pre-designated spots where Robo smashes through doors or compromised walls and takes the bad guys by surprise, offering you a few seconds of slow motion to take out enemies before they can return fire or shoot their hostages. This translation of a nearly 40-year-old action movie into a game is so detailed and strictly loyal to the films that it almost resembles something fan-made – and I mean that in the best way. There’s very little artistic license taken, favoring nearly 1:1 translations from the source material across the board. RoboCop looks and sounds like his original self, complete with Peter Weller’s piercing gaze under his helmet, and voice reprising his best-known role. Officer Anne Lewis is there as RoboCop’s partner and confidant, and looks exactly like actress Nancy Allen portrayed her. Whether it's the Detroit West precinct office, the OCP corporate office, or the mean streets of dystopian Detroit, Rogue City nails the look and feel of the movies to an impressive degree. The entire ‘80s-ness of the presentation is brilliant. The heavy use of synth in the soundtrack fits it to a tee. The dark grimy streets and mohawk-sporting gangs that were central fictional goons throughout the decade are present in force. There are CRT monitors in all the cubices, a green wireframe HUD, and police cruisers that look an awful lot like the old Ford Tauruses that were used in the movies. Small touches, like the visible scan lines when you zoom in and aim down your weapon sights (which also highlights enemies so you can pick them off through smoke and darkness), is exactly the right vibe. Similarly, there’s no modernization of the original’s satirical critique of police brutality – and arguably, none is needed. The appeal to nostalgia is strong, and that can have a significant impact on how much mileage you get out of this. As a pure shooter, Rogue City isn’t overly ambitious, but it’s a lot of fun to play even if you don’t know anything about the series. However, if you grew up with RoboCop or recently watched the movies then it is chock-full of references and nods that add a lot to the experience. I found myself laughing out loud the first time I saw someone driving a 6000 SUX out in the wild. Exploding the groin of a baddie is a silly bit of over-the-top violence on its surface, but it’s so much more entertaining if you know that it’s pulled directly from the film.  At the same time, this isn’t the most technically impressive game when held up next to the flashy big-budget adventures we’re regularly treated to these days. Textures are kind of flat and lighting effects are minimalistic, plus a lot of the gang members’ voices are extremely similar to one another, but there’s something B-movie quality that makes it more forgivable, if not a bit charming. Still, another coat of polish would have gone a long way, especially in cutscenes where all of those issues are more apparent in close-ups. More than once I had audio and video get out of sync, had frozen faces accompany dialogue, and had total game crashes on two occasions. Levels alternate between very linear A-to-B stages in which you charge through enemies looking for the “New Guy” in Town who’s taken over the Nuke business in the aftermath of RoboCop 2, and self-contained sandbox areas that put the “cop” in RoboCop. As you walk around the mean streets of Detroit you’ll come across side missions focused on Robo’s prime directives of Serve the Public Trust, Protect the Innocent, and Uphold the Law. Some are simple, such as having you issue fines for small infractions. It sounds kind of silly, but it’s a fun bit of roleplaying to see an oversized truck parked on the curb leaking oil and slap a ticket on the windshield. One memorable scene had me manning a podium at the police office, listening to a litany of citizen complaints. The image of Robo standing there while a wanted criminal tries to turn himself in for the reward money makes me laugh every time I think about it. Other side missions are more expansive and are the sort of contained side stories that feel worth playing on their own merits. One subplot spanning multiple quests has you helping to reform a drug addict turned informant. Seemingly mundane things like helping him return a watch he stole, or picking out a VHS tape from a video store, are poignant palette-cleansers from the brutal action sequences, though there are certainly a few good shootouts along the way.  Completing all the side quests and main story took me just over 17 hours, a pretty solid runtime for a single-player-only campaign. A simple leveling system does a good job of offering a basic sense of progression as you go, feeding skill points into things like increasing damage resistance or extending the slow motion timeframes, as well as some non-combat skills that open up new dialogue options or allow you to open safes. Every few upgrades spent on a particular skill add a perk, like a rapid dash maneuver, or armor that reflects small arms fire back at enemies. Finding bits of evidence scattered around, reading notes, and completing bonus objectives are good sources of XP, giving a nice incentive to go off the beaten path in the open areas. RoboCop: Rogue City is a pitch-perfect throwback to the action movies of the ‘80s. It’s over-the-top violence with charm, largely well put together but rough on the edges. Most importantly, it's a fun way to spend time in a beloved fictional universe that doesn’t overstay its welcome. Blasting at goons as an unstoppable walking machine remains as extremely entertaining as it seemed on the big screen, thanks in part to an impressive commitment to capturing the look and feel of the original film. Mixing in elements like routine police work and side quests does a great job changing the pace, too. Even if it’s not the best example of visual fidelity, and prone to some bugs along the way, that love of RoboCop shines through. This is a solid B movie of a video game, which is exactly what the source material demands. "
9,The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria ,4.0,"The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria might lovingly depict one of the most recognizable fantasy worlds ever created, but to my surprise, that’s not actually the most recognizable thing about it. This is a survival game first and a Lord of the Rings game second, content to replicate all the familiar mechanics of the genre while leaning heavily on its Tolkien backdrop to compensate for a lack of original ideas. If you’ve played any survival game in the last 15 years, you’ll immediately know what you’re in for as you build bases, cook food, upgrade your pickaxes to mine better ores, craft armor and weapons to fight hordes of enemies, and run back home when it gets dark. The trouble is there’s no part of the tried-and-true survival blueprint that Return to Moria does better than games that came before it, and there are some parts, like the terrible combat and constraining building, that are significantly worse than most.   Return to Moria’s story takes place during Middle-earth’s Fourth Age, after the fall of Sauron and the conclusion of the War of the Ring – an interesting choice, since this era has not been explored much at all in the canon. Everyone’s favorite dwarf and occasional projectile, Gimli (who is once again voiced by movie trilogy actor John Rhys-Davies), has called all the dwarf factions back to Moria in order to reclaim it from the goblins and orcs who have taken over. As one of those summoned dwarves, you and up to seven friends are sent into the menacing bowels of the lost kingdom to cook rat meat, decorate hastily assembled hovels, and juggle dozens of materials between haphazardly placed chests like the unrepentant hoarders you are. After an opening cutscene that throws you into a dark hole, the story slowly builds to a confrontation with a powerful entity that’s corrupted Moria with dark magic. That said, most of that story is little more than a series of excuses to reference the events of Fellowship of the Ring, like when you find the stone Pippin threw down the well or walk through the room where Frodo’s Mithril saved him from an otherwise-fatal blow; just about every other room finds a way to remind you that the Fellowship traveled through here. It’s not that the story is bad overall, and I can forgive a certain amount of fan service in a Lord of the Rings game, but the larger issue with it is that you spend about 95% of the journey, which took me nearly 45 hours to complete, jogging through dark corridors and beating up irritating goblins, so it’s easy to forget there’s any kind of plot to follow to begin with. Occasionally, though, it reminds you you’re in Middle-earth in endearing ways – namely through song. If you’ve ever read a Tolkien book then you know the man could only go a few pages before he felt the insurmountable urge to lay down a beat, and I love how much Return to Moria pays tribute to that legacy. While mining all manner of ore, your dwarf will start singing from a wide library of light-hearted songs. If you get drunk with your comrades, you’ll all start dancing and singing some epic ballad about your people’s history. And during key story moments, you’ll break out some especially stirring songs filled with lore and a whole lot of heart. That is, if you aren’t interrupted by a sudden emergence of goblins and orcs trying to kill you in the middle of your musical number, as I was a number of times. The main thing Return to Moria gets right is the almost rhythmic pattern of gathering more and better resources to feed your growing base-building needs. That loop of exploring deeper and deeper into a dangerous mine filled with monsters as you collect resources and improve your character can be entertaining. While at first you can get by with a dusty pickaxe and sword, you’ll quickly find yourself outmatched by enemies further down in the darkness, and therein lies the fun. You’ll need to acquire rarer raw materials, upgrade your gear, and improve the accommodations at your base to make the going easier, like a very necessary keg filled with beer to maintain morale. It’s easy to get lost in the continuous grind as you aim for the latest shiny thing that’s going to enable you to brave the next leg of the journey. This loop will be very familiar to anyone who’s stayed up too late running around in Minecraft or slaying giant spiders in Grounded, so we’re not exploring new territory here, but it’s extremely important that Return to Moria at least retreads that ground well. Unfortunately, the actual building, combat, and especially exploration that come along with that generally enjoyable grind all miss the mark, and all for the same reason: a shocking absence of freedom. While you can set up a base from scratch almost anywhere, each new zone has at least one or two preset campsites that are extremely beneficial to use as starting points, making it very difficult to justify dumping a bunch of resources into making camp anywhere else. And even when I did decide to go rogue and settle down in a place of my choosing, most of the time the building options were so frustratingly finicky it made me regret the undertaking. In one case I spent half an hour trying to build a second story for my base that kept collapsing due to some unspecific rules regarding load-bearing structures, and in another I immediately realized the area I’d chosen was diagonally oriented on Return to Moria’s grid-based map, meaning every single structure I placed was chaotically incompatible with the layout of the room. It really feels like the designers did everything they could think of to prevent you from creating your own settlements, which is certainly a strange set of priorities for an adventure that’s literally all about rebuilding Moria. Even worse is combat, which is a very dull pattern of blocking, stabbing, or shooting arrows with only a few weapon types that feel far too similar, which is a major ball to drop since Return to Moria has you doing a whole heck of a lot of it. Goblins, orcs, and uruks spawn all over the map whenever you’re not looking, raise an army against you whenever your mining and exploration create too much noise, and assault your bases with intent to destroy them on a regular basis. Many of these encounters can last 15 to 20 minutes, as dozens and dozens of identical cretins surround you and continuously respawn for a painful amount of time. Fighting is largely not difficult, since the enemy AI is some of the most facepalmingly incompetent I’ve ever seen, but with large health bars and regular incoming attacks that had me dodging and blocking more than I had the opportunity to attack, it drags on for far too long.  And when I say enemy AI is bad, I really can’t understate it. Enemies constantly get stuck on top of and inside their surroundings, allow you to stand at a safe distance and pick them off with ranged attacks, and repeat the same attacks over and over again, letting you spam the same response a dozen times before they finally go down for the count. Every once in a while you get a new enemy type like a drake or a troll to contend with, but even these fall victim to terrible AI, quickly casting any excitement straight into the fires of Mount Doom. Also, I also feel the need to mention just how annoying the enemies are. They never stop screaming like maniacs and, even if you’re not in their immediate vicinity, you can hear them hooting and hollering nonstop. After more than 40 hours of that, I felt like letting out a psychotic scream of my own.  Return to Moria also makes the perplexing choice of not actually letting you mine in any direction you want, instead putting up hard, impenetrable barriers wherever you go, and only allowing you to dig through laughably small hallways that connect one area to another. No Man’s Sky and Ark have longevity because there’s no end to the ways you can make the world your own, build creative and interesting bases, and express yourself. Return to Moria has bafflingly little of that. Even mining is limited to small deposits found on the sides of the mine’s halls, providing a shallow deposit to be carved out before hitting another impenetrable barrier. It’s just wild to play as a dwarf in a mine without being able to actually dig through… basically anything. On the bright side, all the areas you encounter along the way have a lot of personality to them, from the Elven Quarter filled with trees and beauty, to some gross depths covered in glowing mushrooms and clouds of poisonous corruption. Highlighting one of the only ways Return to Moria differentiates itself from its peers, traveling through this underground kingdom’s linear path feels like a proper Lord of the Rings adventure. Even if very little of it stands out as particularly impressive, I still enjoyed the gratifying process of building up my base in an area, improving my gear, then packing my things and journeying deeper underground to see if I can survive what’s next. That does make the journey a bit more linear than your typical survival game, but in the tradition of Tolkien adventures that lead the heroes on a harrowing adventure from one part of Middle-earth to another, it just feels right. One of the areas Return to Moria falls shortest is in its consistently poor performance, from bugs like items disappearing, to issues like unstable framerates and abnormally long loading times. There are even extreme cases like how some areas fail to load before you get there, exposing developer objects like immersion-ruining walls separating two parts of the map that don’t disappear until you’ve gotten entirely too close to them. In fact, there are only a few cases where Return to Moria ever looks or performs well at all, and it seems to get worse when more players are added to a world, especially for the guests (since I usually played in my host world, my friends experienced even worse performance than I did). Performance aside though, Return to Moria is most definitely best when enjoyed among friends, as no Lord of the Rings tale is complete without a party of friends to share the adventure with. It might make things significantly more chaotic to have four or five friends in your world all breaking stuff and smacking around wolves, plus the need to feed all those mouths and craft enough gear to go around can add to the grind, but it’s very nice to even the odds in large combat encounters that go by much quicker with a group. Plus, it’s always handy to have someone to revive you or help you carry all the loot you don’t have room for in your backpack. But again, this is a case of the more, the buggier. As a big fan of both The Lord of the Rings and survival games, I was enticed by the idea that I can dive into a genre I already know and love with the rich lore of Middle-earth to keep me company (as well as a party of friends), but it’s disappointing to see such a promising concept do little more than a barely passable impression of better games. Combat is dull and repetitive, owing to overused enemy types and braindead AI, and limited mining opportunities or freedom with settlement building throws a wet blanket over the creativity that’s typically a selling point for the genre. Throw in rough technical performance and it becomes difficult to recommend Return to Moria to even my fellow Tolkien stans. There’s a decent game in here somewhere, as the compelling progression loop and chaotic multiplayer capabilities can make for a really good time – I just can’t give you many reasons to pick this survival game over the plethora of better options when it’s only ever by-the-numbers at best. "
10,Alan Wake II ,9.0,"Thirteen years after his wife went missing in the small town of Bright Falls, author Alan Wake is trapped inside a Dark Place that he can’t seem to write himself out of. As I sit down to type out this review of Alan Wake II, I can somewhat empathize. This is just so incomparable to anything else I’ve played in recent memory that it’s tough to work out exactly where to start. Alan Wake II is a single-player adventure that seamlessly shifts from slow-burn psychological terror to frantic survival-horror action, from gorgeously rendered game worlds to striking full-motion video sequences, and from morbid investigations to show-stopping musical surprises. It’s bloody, it's bonkers, and for the most part it's utterly brilliant. Coming in at the tail end of a bumper-crop gaming year packed with absolute bangers, Alan Wake II still manages to burn as brightly as a freshly fired signal flare. Spanning two wildly contrasting realities, Alan Wake II’s roughly 17-hour story manages to be far more coherent than that of the original – despite its substantial increase in complexity. We pick things up in present day Bright Falls, taking control of FBI Agent Saga Anderson, who’s been dispatched to the small lakeside town to investigate the latest victim in a series of ritualistic slaughters: a body found beside Cauldron Lake with a gaping hole where his heart used to be. Saga is an instantly likable addition to the weird world that Alan Wake shares with Remedy Entertainment’s other supernatural game, Control. She’s dedicated to her casework but not above a bit of playful banter with her partner, Special Agent Alex Casey, and these opening couple of hours of mostly combat-free procedural investigation give the story a realistic grounding before the darkness starts to descend and every placid hillscape transforms into a harrowing hellscape.  Part of the reason Alan Wake II’s main serial killer mystery and its numerous subplots are so easy to keep track of is due to the caseboard found in Saga’s metaphysical ‘mind place’, which can be accessed at any moment with the tap of a button. Each new piece of evidence, character profile, or foreshadowing manuscript page found in Bright Falls and its surroundings must be manually arranged onto a branching tree of red string and palm cards pinned to the wall, corralling it all into order and keeping you focused on the case. I’m not ashamed to say that I couldn’t get through a season of True Detective (at least, one of the good ones) without having one eye on my television and the other on a Reddit thread open on my phone, so I loved having this in-built method of keeping the facts straight. As Saga’s investigation progresses in the early moments of Alan Wake II’s story, each discovery raises more unsettling questions than it answers: Why do so many of the locals behave as though they’ve known Saga for years? Why is the janitor character from Control performing karaoke in a local town hall? And why did that corpse suddenly haul his naked arse out of the morgue and into the woods? Although its difficulty level can be adjusted to three different settings, Alan Wake II’s mood is always set to uneasy mode. The mystery deepens still when Alan Wake washes up onto the shore of Cauldron Lake, rambling about the Dark Place and surprised to learn that he’s been missing for the past 13 years. Then Alan Wake II really gets weird. From here, the perspective shifts back and forth between Saga’s search for the truth in Bright Falls and Alan’s desperate attempts to escape his doomed Dark Place dimension, with both sides gradually bleeding into each other in increasingly unpredictable and discombobulating ways – to the point that I could barely discern fact from fiction (within fiction) before eventually resolving into a supremely well-executed gut-punch of an ending that neatly ties off the bulk of the story threads while tantalizingly leaving a handful of loose ones to dangle. Remedy, if you make us wait another 13 years to tie these up (and start more) that will be much less endearing. Taxi Driver and Mean Streets on a loop, this rotten slice of the Big Apple is a haunting otherworld that I found consistently compelling to explore, from the graffiti-covered construction areas to the menacing sprawl of subway tunnels that lie beneath its surface. Alan’s stages also stimulated a different part of my brain by introducing some enjoyable environmental puzzles. Using a paranormal table lamp, Alan can absorb the energy from one light source and redirect it to another in order to both create a new illuminated safe haven from the evils that lurk in the shadows – but also to physically alter the world around him and open up new paths forward. It’s a dazzling trick that recalls the pulling of the light switch cord to blink in and out of the Oceanview Hotel from the Oldest House in Control, and it grows in complexity over time: determining the right sequence to manipulate multiple light sources progressively ups the challenge involved in unlocking each new area to examine. In place of gathering evidence and arranging it on a caseboard like in Saga’s stages, in Alan’s reality you must seek out plot elements in the form of floating pairs of orbs that must be observed from the right perspective to create an eclipse that triggers ghostly, hardboiled scenes from Alan’s own Alex Casey crime novel series. These can then be rewritten into Alan’s present scenario to distort his reality into disturbing new dioramas that bring him closer towards the dark place’s exit, and reveal ominous parallels to the Bright Falls slayings that Saga seeks to solve. (And here I was thinking Michael Cera was the only Alan desperate to escape a corrupted alternate reality this year.) To make things all the more disconcerting, Alan Wake II’s Creative Director, Sam Lake, plays both the character of Alex Casey in Alan’s world and FBI Special Agent Alex Casey in Saga’s story, and also appears as himself in a peculiar late night talk show that Alan finds himself as a recurring guest on. You might not know his name but you probably know his famous face, since it was plastered on the mug of the original Max Payne. He even does the signature scowl! Alan Wake II’s heavy meta-mystery is like a jigsaw puzzle locked inside a Rubik’s Cube that’s covered in sudokus, and it’s honestly such a strange and wonderful trip that takes more unexpected detours and recursive loops than a disgruntled Uber driver. Indeed Alan Wake II features more plots than a cemetery, and just as high a bodycount. The fundamentals of combat remain largely the same as the enjoyable flashlight-fueled fighting of the original, but its execution has been enhanced significantly. Enemies are once again literal shadows of their former selves, and the most efficient way to dispatch them is by using the boosted beam of your flashlight to burn away their cloudy darkness shields and blasting disgusting chunks of exposed flesh off their bones with your expanding arsenal of firearms. This time around glowing weak points will occasionally be revealed on an enemies’ body, and if you manage to successfully target them you can inflict substantially more damage and save a few precious ammo rounds in the process, which felt like a nice reward for taking an extra fraction of a second to carefully line up my shots. This won’t be a big deal to anybody used to games that allow you to run, but if you’re coming back to Alan Wake along with me it is fantastic: Both Saga and Alan are blessed with an unlimited sprint ability, which marks a huge improvement to the perennially out-of-puff Alan from the original, who couldn’t run 10 yards without doubling over like an asthmatic who just took a wrong turn into a smokers lounge. Our protagonists are generally more nimble, too; the dodge button feels snappier and allowed me to more reliably duck under swinging pipes or thrown pickaxes, and it even works on the ground should you be knocked off your feet, allowing you to quickly roll out of harm’s way and avoid any potential follow-up attacks.  But challenge is part of the charm of the original, and Remedy has not forgotten that. Saga and Alan may be more fleet-footed in Alan Wake II, but ammunition and batteries remain scarce. And although it doesn’t quite rival Resident Evil 4 in terms of enemy variety, there are enough different gloomy goons to be surprised by that I could never really anticipate which breed of shadow warrior was waiting to ambush me down any given path. From hulking brutes with sledgehammers to darting wolves and freakish, multi-limbed mirror monsters that I can’t quite accurately describe, Alan Wake II consistently shuffled its deck to keep my head on a swivel and my thumb nervously twitching over the quick select weapon menu. Some enemies even throw darkness projectiles that home in on you and must either be dodged or carefully caught with your flashlight’s beam like a fighter jet’s countermeasures. I haven’t seen this much shade thrown since the last Eminem diss track. There are some wonderfully frantic and distinct boss fights too, including a dimly lit, close-quarters scrap with a rampaging reanimated corpse who was hellbent on caving my chest in with the sharp end of a torn-off tree branch, and another later on that had me desperately burning away an arena full of darkness blobs while trying to avoid having my head separated from my shoulders by an enemy’s rifle shots from afar. Yet oddly enough, I found that the enemy in Alan Wake II that I feared the most was the one that more often than not couldn’t even hurt me. Alan’s reality is littered with whispering apparitions, but nine times out of 10 they dissipate into wisps of smoke if you train your flashlight on them. It’s that tenth instance you need to worry about, though, because it’s likely to be an actual physical nasty waiting to ambush you from plain sight after you’ve been lulled into a false sense of security. As a result, I started second-guessing each and every human-shaped shadow – including my own – which felt perfectly in sync with Alan’s own unraveling mental state. Alan’s mental health isn’t the only thing here that isn’t as strong as it could be. Although the different arsenals of the two playable characters each boast their own advantages, from the heightened stopping power and reusable bolts of Saga’s crossbow to the expanded area-of-effect of Alan’s flare gun, their individual skill trees seem somewhat lopsided in their implementation. Whereas Alan’s ‘Words of Power’ skill tree features 21 different skills that can each be potentially upgraded up to three times over, Saga’s upgrades are limited to just three buffs for each firearm in her inventory, and each comes at such a high cost of the collectable manuscript scraps hidden around Bright Falls that by the time I’d reached the end credits I’d only invested in a handful of them. To be frank, they didn’t feel all that necessary on the normal difficulty setting, but perhaps they’ll be of far greater use in the planned Nightmare difficulty that’s set to be added to Alan Wake II post-launch. Furthermore, and in contrast with Alan’s impressive environmental remixing, Saga is regularly saddled with a few too many survival-horror stereotypes, like fuse boxes to repair and combination locks to solve (although to be fair, decoding the latter does require a significant amount of brain power at times). I was also a little bit disappointed that there were no new Night Springs episodes to watch on the televisions in Bright Falls, although having said that, the commercials that are substituted in their place (starring a pair of local entrepreneurs called the Koskela brothers) were so hilariously offbeat that I still tried to track down every in-game idiot box I could find. (I’m talking about fictional commercials, that is, not poorly implemented product-placement for Verizon Wireless.) Still, any issues I had with Alan Wake II sank without a trace like an out-of-towner in Cauldron Lake, washed away by the torrent of other things that it gets right. It undoubtedly takes a lot of inspiration from film and television, taking the Twin Peaks-meets-The Twilight Zone base of the original and mixing in the best bits of True Detective, Seven, Inception, and more into the pot. But it also folds in some nods to some modern gaming classics, blindsiding you with truly unnerving, Inscryption-like fourth-wall trickery and eerie full-motion video moments that recall 2022’s found-footage freak out, Immortality. In one truly astonishing early game moment that I don’t want to completely spoil here, it even briefly becomes an interactive musical; as though the team at Remedy took one look at the ‘Jump Up, Super Star!’ level from Super Mario Odyssey and decided to appropriate it in the most bombastically bizarre way possible. For a glorious 20 minutes or so, Alan Wake II resembles something less like a survival-horror video game and more like a Rocky Horror Picture Show, and it had me grinning like a maniac from the ring of the first riff to the final blazing guitar solo. Although Alan Wake II has no shortage of out-of-your-seat scares, it’s moments like these that prove Remedy has approached the actual design of its long-awaited sequel completely without fear. Alan Wake II delivers one of the boldest and most brain-bending survival-horror storylines this side of Silent Hill 2, presents it with uniformly immaculate art direction and audio design, and reinvigorates the series’ signature light-based shooting as though it’s been locked and loaded with a fresh pack of Energizers. Even though its skill-upgrade systems seem a little superfluous and there were a few repeated cliches in Saga’s story that stuck in my craw, I nonetheless found both sides of this twisted tale to be endlessly fascinating, frequently fear-inducing, and consistently surprising. Alan Wake II is a superb survival-horror sequel that makes the cult-classic original seem like little more than a rough first draft by comparison. "
11,Ghostrunner 2 ,9.0,"The best sequels are the ones that can recapture what made the original so great, while also expanding those elements to make them feel bigger, grander, and more exciting than what came before. That’s exactly what Ghostrunner 2 manages to pull off. This is still a first person, one-hit-kill slasher where – to quote my review of the first one – you must run fast, slide fast, kill fast, and if you can’t do those things fast enough, you die fast. But now you get to do all of that while also occasionally riding an absolutely sick motorcycle, and with a wider variety ninja tricks to customize your playstyle. Couple that with a much more fleshed out world, excellent level variety, fantastic bosses, and a thumping soundtrack that enhances the action, and you’ve got one of the most exciting action games all year. Ghostrunner 2 picks up shortly after the events of the first game, which are recapped in a handy dandy video. Story is a much bigger focus this time around, with most levels being preceded by a visit to a hub where you can chat with your fellow rebels. You’ll learn about their mostly interesting backstories, as well as the post apocalyptic cyberpunk dystopia that is Dharma City, with conversations that were always interesting enough to make me want to check in with everyone before my next mission. There’s Zoe, your friend from the original that helped you find your humanity; Saul, the kind hearted doctor who fixes you up; Kira, a brilliant but morally questionable scientist that used to work for the other side; along with another surprise face or two. It’s not RPG levels of characterization and world building, but these interactions did a great job of grounding me in Ghostrunner 2’s world.  Fundamentally, Ghostrunner 2 plays very much like the first – It’s one hit, one kill for both you and your enemies, which makes for a lightning fast flow. You’ll be darting all across very carefully crafted combat arenas as you desperately try to avoid fire and close the distance between you and your opposition at the same time. If you die, respawns are super quick and checkpoints are very forgiving, which meant I could die 10, 20, maybe even 50 times trying to beat a tricky combat encounter without feeling any frustration. Basically, imagine Hotline Miami or Katana Zero, but in a 3D space, and with all sorts of mobility options that let you dodge bullets and outmaneuver foes with ease. While that core is still the same in Ghostrunner 2, there are several notable changes that affected how I approached its challenges. For one, there’s now a stamina meter that governs your newfound ability to block attacks and dash multiple times in succession. Blocking may sound exceptionally strong in a game where all it takes is one hit to die, but evading enemies is still the way to go when it comes to surviving the chaos that is Ghostrunner’s combat encounters because of how quickly the meter depletes, the many unblockable attacks that enemies use, and the fact that blocking certain attacks will still send you reeling backwards. Still, being able to just block as opposed to having to perfectly time a parry offers some nice leeway that makes many boss encounters much more forgiving, and fun. More substantial are your new special abilities. Shurikens return, but are now available on demand as opposed to being a limited time powerup, which gives you a powerful, but meter managed, ranged attack to go along with your trusty katana. It’s especially fun to use on big enemies like the bipedal mechs, as a hit with a shuriken turns them into a grapple point, which allows you to quickly, and satisfyingly, go in for the kill while also staying on the move. The Ghostrunner gets a few other brand new special abilities and ultimate techniques added to his arsenal as well, such as the Shadow skill, which allows you to turn invisible and create a double at the spot where you activated it, and Flux, which allows you to shoot out a continuous laser beam for a few seconds to decimate groups of foes.  Thankfully, you no longer have to arrange blocks like a puzzle to upgrade these abilities. Skill progression is much more straightforward, with you unlocking a variety of upgrade chips naturally just by playing through the campaign. You can purchase whatever chips you want, but in order to equip them to your motherboard, you’ll have to add slots by finding purple memory chips hidden in each level. This adds a nice incentive to really explore for the secrets of every stage beyond just unlocking superficial collectibles, like new sword skins, glove colors, etc. I always looked forward to coming back to the base and seeing what new skill chips were available, because they really do a great job of giving noticeable perks that could dramatically change my approach to a level. I could invest in Shurikens and give myself more of an edge from a distance, or I could invest in my sword skills and get rewarded more heavily for executing perfect parries. Or,r if I feel especially confident, I could invest in flow and gain powerful buffs, but only if I’m able to string kills together without letting the combo counter drop. One of the best qualities of the first Ghostrunner was how just about every level introduced some sort of new element for you to deal with, making the campaign feel fresh all the way through. Apparently that well of ideas never came close to running dry because the same is true for Ghostrunner 2. Throughout the entirety of its 10-12 hour campaign, you’re constantly encountering new enemy types, gaining new powers or abilities, visiting a variety of gorgeous and visually distinct areas both in and outside of Dharma City, and getting thrown into arenas that give you exciting new ways to use your existing powers. The different styles of gameplay can basically be broken down into: Combat arenas, parkour challenges, and motorcycle segments, but there’s a truly impressive amount of variation within each of those styles. Because of the one-hit kill nature, combat often becomes a puzzle where you have to figure out which way to approach from, what enemies you should target first, which of them can be easily taken out with environmental hazards, and so on. Every encounter is an incredibly satisfying combination of planning, execution, and on the fly improvisation. On the parkour side, it’s a lot of what existing fans are probably used to: Lengthy stretches of wallrunning, railgrinding, grapple hooking, and pole swinging. But in Ghostrunner 2, it’s everything in between those actions that makes it special. Sometimes you’ll need to use a shuriken to power up a device, and then quickly move onto it before certain death; other times you’ll need to use your shadow ability at just the right time to interrupt a beam of light that causes a life saving swinging pole to emerge; and in my absolute favorite section, you’ll need to swap between making two different colored objects tangible as you jump between them, much like you would in Guacamelee or one of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor’s more challenging bonus rooms. It’s tough as nails, but absolutely exhilarating. And then there’s the motorcycle, which is responsible for some of the coolest moments in all of Ghostrunner 2. You’ll not only use it for high speed tunnel chases, but also as a key exploration tool in the back half of the story to explore huge open environments. Some of the best bits are when you’re speeding through a claustrophobic tunnel, quickly shifting to riding on the ceiling to avoid a hazard, or when you leap off your bike, send it careening towards a group of enemies, and then grapple hook right back on it. Ghostrunner 2 is full of moments like this where I had to take my hands off of the keyboard for a second and just admire how cool a game just made me feel. All of this is enhanced by a perfectly matched thumping electronic soundtrack that had my head bobbing all throughout. In addition to the campaign, there’s also a really fun side mode called Rogue Runner that cleverly uses the upgrades, enemies, and powers from the main game, mixes them in with randomized parkour and combat challenges, and turns it all into a very compelling roguelike formula. The way it works is that every run you start with just a basic set of moves, a limited number of lives, and you’re able to choose what type of level you play next; whether that be a combat level, a parkour level, or a harder version of those levels that promise a better reward. The levels themselves are procedurally generated, making it very important to be able to quickly read and understand the nuances of a particular challenge, since the element of trial and error is largely gone when you only have a handful of lives to take you through the whole mode. Beating a level may reward you with more lives, or you can choose one of three upgrade chips, most of which can be obtained in the main game, but some of which are exclusive to this mode. Ultimately, it’s an expanded version of the wave mode that was introduced as DLC in the first game, but it’s still nonetheless a compelling extra mode that I’m having a great time coming back to even after having completed the main campaign. Ghostrunner 2 is an electric sequel that supercharges everything that was great about the original and elevates it to a whole new level. The lightning fast, skill-heavy, one-hit kill combat is as exciting as ever, packed with even more tricks that give you plenty of new options to approach every scenario. The parkour also remains as smooth as silk, and some of the new motorcycle sequences are among the most exhilarating moments I’ve had all year. Those who didn’t vibe with the intensely reflex-heavy gameplay of the first Ghostrunner probably won’t be swayed by any of these improvements, but if the original was up your alley, I can’t imagine a better sequel than this. "
12,Super Mario Bros. Wonder ,9.0,"Every single Mario platformer game, 2D or 3D, seems to gleefully reinvent itself to some degree, doubling down on the unique delights that they bring me. Continuing that trend, Super Mario Bros. Wonder is very aptly named because, quite simply, it is full of wonder. Literally wonderful! Every frame oozes joy, from its bright colors to the Flower Kingdom’s ubiquitous talking flower, who’s never lacking in words of encouragement as you run and jump through dozens upon dozens of stages that are altered by unpredictable and often grin-inducing Wonder effects and, more often than not, the antics of Mario himself. Whether you enjoy it solo or with up to three friends, there’s a lot to love about Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Wonder catches the eye immediately. It dazzles due to its typical and welcome use of a wide variety of colors, with a particular emphasis on vivid blues, reds, greens, and yellows. But it’s particularly impressive in motion. With apologies to Yoshi’s Island, it looks like what you’d imagine a proper Super Mario World sequel should be if it were made in 2023 instead of 1995.  Animations are the undeniable standout here: Mario reaches back for his hat when he dashes into pipes, critters’ eyes bulge in fear as they run in terror from a pursuing plumber, Goombas have snot bubbles on their nostrils as they nap, Elephant Mario squeezes his giant, round body into warp pipes and – awkwardly – tries to make himself as small as he can when crouching under a low row of blocks. There are so many more! Those touches go a long way toward bringing Mario’s first trip to the Flower Kingdom to life. What is the Flower Kingdom? It’s a neighbor to the familiar Mushroom Kingdom, and it proved to be a refreshing setting mostly because it brought so many new and unique enemies for Mario to stomp on. Story-wise, you can already guess: A visiting Mario finds himself caught up in another Bowser caper, of course, as the reptile uses the land’s Wonder powers to fuse himself with the kingdom’s primary castle, making life miserable for its inhabitants. As always, the story is paper (Mario) thin, and you know you’re going to fight Bowsers Junior along the way. But it leaves no cloud hanging over the Flower Kingdom, because the dozens of stages across six main worlds – along with the Petal Isles hub that contains stages of its own – offer so many different looks and wild hooks that the typically forgettable story simply didn’t matter. Most levels include at least two Wonder Seeds, with one of them at the end and another hidden somewhere within it. Getting access to that hidden seed usually involves finding a Wonder Flower – sometimes hidden in blocks, bad guys, or in secret areas – that makes something unexpected happen. Sadly I’m not allowed to show you most of the best ones, but Mario might transform into a rolling spiky ball, or the camera might shift to a top-down perspective, or Mario and his enemies alike might morph into stretchy ink silhouettes, or he might turn into a Goomba who can’t jump or attack, or there might be a dance party. You just never know what will happen next. As such, I looked forward to the Wonder effects on every stage. They’re so much fun to experience that if I missed one in a level, I had plenty of motivation to run back in to find it. In short, the Wonders make the game. It certainly doesn’t hurt that each world packs entirely different groups of enemies that include mostly new foes, but with some callbacks to both staple classics like the cloud-riding Lakitus and deeper cuts like the Pokeys from Super Mario Bros. 2. Among the newbies, the Bulrushes come rushing at you and cannot be defeated by traditional stomping. But they can be ridden, which Wonder takes clever advantage of. The derpy looking Maw-Maws, meanwhile, look sweet, chill, and innocent – until they spot you, at which point their gaping maws open wide and will swallow you whole if you don’t jump very high very quickly. The Mumsies, on the other hand, pose little threat aside from their difficult-to-leap-over height, and I never got tired of grabbing onto their loose piece of cloth and unraveling them into oblivion. I hope we get to see the Flower Kingdom again someday because I don’t want this to be the only appearance for this fresh group of interesting new enemies. Another wrinkle in the 2D Mario formula comes in the form of Badges, a group of roughly two dozen unlockable active or passive effects you can choose to take into each level. Boosting Spin Jump lets you tap the right shoulder button to effectively double jump. Grappling Vine means even Mario games have grappling hooks now, Safety Bounce will let you survive a fall into lava, and Sensor pings more frequently as you get closer to key objects like large purple coins and (crucially) Wonder Flowers. These Badges give you some welcome control over how you tackle stages in a way that best suits your playstyle, not to mention offering a bit of replayability as a cherry on top. Some Badges can be purchased at shops, while others are earned when you complete Badge Challenge stages designed around that particular powerup. By comparison, buying a Badge with purple coins was unsatisfying, especially considering I was never short on them – I wish each of them had a fun challenge associated with it instead of just some of them. Speaking of new additions, Super Mario Bros. Wonder offers familiar four-player local and brand-new online multiplayer, with the online component being surprisingly seamlessly integrated. I don’t see it as appointment multiplayer gaming – couch co-op is still where it’s at in any multiplayer Mario game – but it works, and the friend races you can initiate on most stages can be a fun distraction from the primary platforming action. And whether you play on the same screen together or online, it is nice to see Nintendo put forth a more concerted effort to make multiplayer feel like a more organic part of the platforming, rather than a tacked-on afterthought, through things like Standees – which let you leave respawn points for your friends – and turning your pals into Ghosts that won’t physically get in your way during a precise jump or maneuver. But let me circle back to Elephant Mario for a second. Is he explained? Does he make any sense at all? Does it matter? No. Is he awesome? Yes. He is a dominant, Shaq-like force in Super Mario Bros. Wonder, complete with absolutely hilarious animations. A tap of the Y button sends smaller foes flying away when he swipes at them with his trunk. He can hold water in said trunk, too, dousing hot blocks and watering thirsty plants where needed. His sheer bulk even allows him to smash bricks with his trunk. He’s just a blast. Drill Mario is also a welcome addition. With a drill bit on his hat, he can burrow into the ground – or the ceiling! – to access hidden areas and spring up from below on unsuspecting bad guys. I can’t quite say the same for Bubble Mario. He blows large bubbles that can snag coins, slightly home in on and ensnare enemies, and be used as jumping pads, which is all useful enough. But when given the choice of which Mario form I wanted to take (just like in past Mario games, you can keep a powerup in reserve to switch back and forth as needed), I typically opted for Elephant Mario or good ol’ Fire Mario. Despite the joy radiating from most of the 2D Super Mario Bros. Wonder, it’s not quite up to par with the last mainline 3D Mario masterpiece, Super Mario Odyssey. The music, while not at all bad, is surprisingly forgettable this time around, and while there are some five-star difficulty stages – including an entire group of them I won’t spoil here – Wonder is a bit light on the challenge side of things, so there’s not as much here for seasoned series veterans as its predecessor has. Though in fairness, Mario is for everyone, and my daughter appreciated the inclusion of Nabbit as a playable character – when we played together, enemies couldn’t hurt her and we had more fun progressing through many of the stages. I nevertheless remain hungry for Mario’s next 3D adventure, especially as I watch the calendar surpass six years since Odyssey. Super Mario Bros. Wonder establishes a new standard for what 2D Mario platformers should look like. It is colorful, it is alive, and it is joyful. It also managed to surprise and delight me in continually more creative ways thanks to its unpredictable Wonder Effects, which transform levels into something completely different for a brief while. Like dessert in the middle of the main course of each stage, they were irresistible and always put a smile on my face – as did the absolute beast that is Elephant Mario. In every way other than advanced challenges, Wonder feels like a 21st-century successor to Super Mario World, and I’m not sure I can give it a higher compliment than that. "
13,Marvel's Spider-Man 2 ,8.0,"It’s funny how cartoons and comic books can influence your experience while playing a video game. While playing Marvel's Spider-Man 2 I kept thinking of the Sam Raimi movies, bits from both the cartoons from the nineties and the Spectacular Spider-Man show, to stories from the comics such as Secret Wars and Kraven’s Last Hunt. It’s a testament to the quality of writing from Insomniac Studios that they managed to make a Peter Parker and Spider-Man that feels like an amalgamation of everything that came before yet still feels like its own thing. Marvel's Spider-Man managed to set a fairly high bar for both Miles Morales and Spider-Man 2 to follow. The good news is that after about twenty-five hours of playing the game and reaching the credits it’s easy to see that Spider-Man 2 meets that high bar quite easily and in certain aspects manages to surpass both its predecessors.  The story starts about nine months after the events of the previous Spider-Man game. Peter is dealing with the loss of his aunt and Miles is having a hard time writing an essay which he needs for his admission to college. Like any great Spider-Man story from the comics display, it’s the duality of trying to have a normal life and dealing with the chaotic nature of the life of a superhero which both Spider-Men seem to struggle with throughout the story of Spider-Man 2. And how when they are doing well in one aspect, they seem to fall short in the other. Luckily, while both Miles and Peter deal with personal stuff, the gameplay as their respective Spider-Men is as great as always. Newly introduced is the Parry-mechanic, which allows you to give your opponents a strong wallop when they try to attack you and avoid incoming damage at the same time. Besides regular attacks, dodges and the use of gadgets both Miles and Peter have their own individual attacks that are tied to the R1 button and one of the face buttons of the controller. Miles is once again in control of his Bio-Electric power but due to certain story beats earns an evolution of said powers. Peter on the other hand fairly quickly in the story gets access to the powers of the symbiote suit which he gets from his best friend Harry Osborn. While previous games hinted at Harry’s fate being tied to his mother’s illness, the new game quickly sets the tone of the story in the sense that the stakes for most of the characters end up being fairly high. Harry’s illness seems to have been cured by the bio-organic suit that was developed by Osborn Industries, but the actual origin of the suit and what it brings to the story and the many twists and turns are best left to be discovered and enjoyed by players themselves. Suffice to say that if you’re a fan of the many Spider-Man stories of the past, you will find a lot of easter eggs and outright fanservice to geek out over in Spider-Man 2. The gameplay of Spider-Man 2 is in many ways similar to the previous two games. You explore the world of New York City and its Burroughs, take out random crime events to earn tokens which you need for upgrades, do some awesome side quests that involve some excellent misdirection when it comes to what you might expect from certain characters and unlock many upgrades and costumes for both of the spiders to play with. While there are a total of sixty-five costumes to unlock, some of them also have optional extra colour schemes available. It gives players a chance to run, fight, swing and fly around the world dressed however they like. And yes, I did say fly. One of the better additions to Spider-Man 2 is the fact that you can now fly around the world by using web wings. Scattered around the city are grates that can give you an upward trajectory to soar high above the streets of New York. And there are also wind tunnels that allow you to move at a breakneck pace through crowded alleys and streets. Some of the sidequests are also tied into this new option and allow you to chase after certain flying droids as you try and download data from them. Fast as those chases may be though, it’s still nothing compared to how quick and easily you can switch between Peter and Miles on the fly. Opening the City app to track side quests and activities allows you to swap between both characters by pressing the square button. It’s simply instantaneous. What makes switching between both characters interesting is that they have a number of quests and missions that are unique to their story and path through the game. But it’s also fun to encounter the other Spider-Man while you’re out and about in the city. At random times it would happen that I responded to a random crime, only to find that the other Spider-Man was already dealing with the crooks I wanted to apprehend. From a technical standpoint the game looks amazing, and the gameplay was very fluid all throughout my time with the story. The game boasts a large number of options when it comes to graphical settings and accessibility for people with disabilities. The options range from Fidelity Mode which renders in 4K and 30fps, a Performance mode at 60fps and variable resolution and 4K Performance mode at 40fps that blends the qualities of the previous two settings but still looks great. While swinging through the world we noticed an amazing number of details. Reflections on the buildings and Ray Tracing were already a given in the previous games, but we oftentimes encountered people doing their thing inside buildings when we glanced through the windows. Another impressive feature is that events that happen during the story have a lasting impact on the surrounding area. Rampages from villains like The Lizard or Flint Marko’s Sandman will leave a completely devastated New York in their wake. And both Spider-Men will also end up with fairly damaged suits after prolonged damage being dealt to them. Luckily, sacrificing one of your skill bars can heal your character right up and quickly restore your suit as if it had been freshly washed by Aunt May. Though that’s obviously something Peter will have to do on his own now. Over the course of the campaign the score of John Paesano had some familiarity with the previous games but the new themes and the music in the second half have a lot of horror undertones that really added to the great atmosphere and tension of the story. Fans of the comics will also surely get a kick out of the many twists and turns of the story and the aforementioned fun little easter eggs that are littered across the game. While there were some story beats that could have had just a smidge more time to breathe or could have been expanded upon, the game does a great job of worldbuilding during the missions themselves. Background information can be found in files, in pictures or even in items if you take a proper look around. Sometimes these details are insignificant to the main plot but oftentimes they flesh out the story and hints at bigger things at play. As a sequel in a spectacular series, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is both blessed and cursed. Its story of two Spider-Men is a great time and a Spidey fan’s dream to play through as comic book pages are brought to life, elegantly walking the tightrope between light humour and heavier themes. Meanwhile, Insomniac refines a successful formula of combat and web-swinging without revolutionising either in major ways, making them comfy and familiar with just enough new tweaks and abilities to elevate them to fun new heights. The part that feels like it actually needed a radical rethinking is the open world of New York City, which has been made bigger but not better, with an exhausting checklist of mostly repetitious side activities. But it’s safe to call this another thrilling Spider-Man adventure that delivers Insomniac's best tale yet, and despite its open world falling short, it's a reliably fun superhero power trip. And, you know what? Screw it. It really did make me feel like Spider-Man, too. "
14,Marvel's Spider-Man 2 ,8.0,"With Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Insomniac has the unenviable task of following up two riveting superhero fantasies full of excitement and heart. While that may sound like a good problem to have, the question becomes where do you go from there? Well, its answer is to double down. Double down on Spider-Men. Double down on the size of the map. Double down on explosive action sequences. In doing so, the studio has crafted another consistently exciting rollercoaster ride and the best story of the series yet – but stand the original alongside this sequel in other ways, and it can look a bit like two Spider-Man games pointing at each other. The excellent combat hasn’t gotten old, but it is largely the same fun as before, and despite that larger map, most of the open-world activities found within it are in desperate need of evolution. The result is a blockbuster in the most modern sense of the word: undeniably thrilling for long stretches, but by the numbers for others. Despite a couple of new tricks up its sleeve, Spider-Man 2’s combat is very familiar – it doesn’t have that new suit smell anymore, but it still feels incredibly comfy to slip back into. The rhythm of precision dodges, the new perfect parries (so you’re not only swerving and striking now), and acrobatic finishers are hugely satisfying, as is chasing high-hit combos to keep the fight as stylish as possible. The movement is smooth and the hits are crunching, like some sort of peanut butter hybrid that every one of your foes is allergic to. Power and elegance are brought together in a brick-to-the-face ballet as enemies are thrown around like dolls, juggled in the air, slammed across concrete floors, and slung into each other like body-armoured bowling pins – but, naturally, never killed. Every bone in their body may be broken and every organ punctured, but of course, they'll somehow live to commit crimes again.  Overall, there’s slightly less emphasis on stealth encounters this time than in either Spider-Man or Miles Morales. As someone who found the stealth action of the previous games a little simplistic and routine, this new, louder approach is welcome. Naturally, there are story missions where Miles or Peter have to slink across ceilings and take out thugs who never look up, but Spider-Man 2 is much more eager for you to get into the action, with many abilities designed to let you group up enemies and then deal big damage to all of them at once, rather than spreading them out to pick them off one by one. A new personal favourite gadget called the Web Grabber – which pulls enemies in from a distance and makes them smack into one another – also playfully builds into this philosophy. I had a lot of fun using this before landing a sharp burst of Miles’ Venom lightning onto grouped-up goons, and now Peter can get in on that fun as well. It takes a bit longer than I expected to arrive, but once Parker dons the symbiote suit already shown off in trailers, the gooey, angry powers that come with it make a big impact, adding more of a brawler nature to fights and giving Peter a set of tools to match Miles’ satisfying electric abilities. They’re just as enjoyable, as it feels like the suit is trying to burst out of the rumbling DualSense controller in my hands. This aggressive style of play is rewarded, as the only way to heal is by building up your focus bar – filled by landing hits and timing perfect dodges – and is another way to make sure that exciting rhythm of combat is never lost. One area that Insomniac has made improvements in is that Spider-Man 2 offers significantly more in the way of enemy variety, so you’ll no longer be battering the same five balaclava bullies with baseball bats. New factions and units, such as flamethrower-wielding cultists that keep you at a distance, flying drones, and hunters who deploy laser grids above your head to limit aerial attacks keep you on your sticky toes. Certain enemies are weak to different types of abilities, such as electric or symbiote attacks, which also adds an enjoyable extra wrinkle to fights. It’s by no means revolutionary stuff, but a welcome added level of complexity that makes you consider which powers – or even which Spider-Man – are best for a given job. That's not to say there aren’t benefits to taking a sneaky route, though, especially when you’re playing as Miles and using his invisibility power to quietly take out enemies. There are many perch takedown possibilities offered and new toys to play with too, such as the Web Line, which allows you to create your own highwires over your enemies to prey on them from above. It’s a fun tool that allows you to reshape the tightly designed arenas into a battlefield more in your favour, and in doing so, redecorate the room with web-wrapped people piñatas. On the other hand, much like combat, stealth isn’t a far cry from the many warehouse encounters you’ll have played in the previous games, as you clear out enemies using largely the same techniques. Spider-Man 2 is, on paper, the perfect sequel. It takes all of the elements that made the first games so much fun and builds and improves on them. Bigger battles, improved ray tracing, wider story choices, more flamboyant combat, dual characters, improved visuals, staggeringly fast and dense city travel are all excellent. The sheer wow factor it delivers will impress, but some of the shine is dulled by comparison to Insomniacs own previous success and work on the remasters of the original and Miles Morales for PS5. Going from the original PS4 or even PS4 Pro Spider-Man games to this is a night-and-day difference in almost all areas, with the most noticeable being seamless loading, ray tracing, AI muscle deformation, vast performance increases and visuals that push the PS5 hard. But from the PlayStation 5 updates, the leap is smaller, if still impressive. None of this diminishes the excellent, varied and amazing game within, but just how amazing that is depends on when you last slipped into the tights of New York’s favourite web head. On the topic of covert ops, the playable MJ sequences from the original return, and while they are more involved this time around and serve the story well, they never add up to more than simple stealth missions or splashes of basic third-person shooting. She’s certainly not sidelined, but it does feel like a little more could’ve been done to make her gameplay sections a bit more exciting – or at least more in line with her established character as an intrepid investigative reporter than the missions she’s sent out on here. Combat aside, our Spider-Men can now swing around their friendly neighborhoods in more stylish ways than ever, with new spins and flips added to the repertoire providing a Tony Hawk-like edge. Performing web acrobatics is as gratifying as you remember, and still one of the best ways to get around any open world. The new web wings are undoubtedly a standout, however: like Batman before him, Spider-Man can now glide and soar with ease through the city, but not without limits – you’ll need to get the hang of managing your altitude and forward momentum, with the aid of windy corridors through the city that can quickly carry you from one district to the next. The story swings just as elegantly between upbeat hijinks and solemn moments of reflection. It's undeniably a fun time to don the suit and enter a Kratos-like rage mode where you push in both thumbsticks and start one-hitting everything in your path, but the writers never once forget to take their eyes off of the humanity inside these superhumans. The same can be said for both its heroes and villains, as Spider-Man 2 tackles the reasoning behind each character's actions and the good that can hide in the shadows of evil. For those with a hazy memory, there is a brief recap of both Peter and Miles’ stories so far available, which is handy, as this is very much a sequel that weaves in both plotlines and characters from the previous games and accompanying DLC. You won’t want to jump in for the first time here since Spider-Man 2 builds on the first two games both in its mechanics and its story – but of course, there’s little reason not to, since those games are also excellent. Avoiding spoilers, the basic premise revolves around Kraven the Hunter, who is, well, craving a hunt. For those uninitiated in the character, he's essentially The Predator, an Apex hunter blessed with super strength who has chosen New York as his next hunting ground. It's a great starting point that sends the city's hero and villain dynamic into flux as he sets his sights on the biggest prey possible. There are also smaller stories at play, though, ones that may seem less important when compared to city-wide chaos, but feel like potential world-enders to those who inhabit it. Both Spider-Men tackle the most extreme examples of trying to manage a work/life balance you can imagine, exploring a range of personal issues including strained relationships and loss that plague us as humans, no matter how superpowered we may feel. It's the best-written story in the series yet (if still a bit cheesy at times), with performances worthy of the script. It’s a real triumph that it manages to cover such a wide spectrum of themes without suffering from tonal thwip-lash. A particularly memorable mission under the dancing lights of Coney Island’s amusement rides is a highlight that manages to impressively capture the story’s essence and bottle up its emotional tension before emphatically smashing it. Primarily a Peter Parker story, Spider-Man 2 explores his relationship with MJ and the reintroduction of childhood best friend Harry Osborne into his life. It’s always compelling to watch him contend with which pieces of the past to leave behind and what future self he wishes to be. In some of the missions where you control normal, everyday Peter, I couldn't help but feel the Uncharted influence more than ever, both in the techniques it uses to tell his story and the show-stopping action sequences when he slips into the suit. No matter how hectic a scenario gets, though, he always has a quippy one-liner ready to be expertly delivered by actor Yuri Lowenthal. Miles still gets his time in the spotlight, however, and has some fantastic moments towards the end of the main campaign, even if some of the more interesting explorations of his Puerto Rican/African American culture are reserved for side missions. Obviously, what you take away from the story and its diverse cast of characters will be unique to you. On the surface, it's another thrilling superhero story packed full of surprises, cameos, and Easter eggs – but there are deeper meanings to be found here, too. Spider-Man 2, and to an extent all great Spider-Man stories, tackle themes of adolescence and puberty – a time of uncertainty for even the most normal of teenagers trying to control bodily fluids. We join Miles at this exact point in his life, with family ties straining, friendships facing fresh challenges, and life decisions of genuine importance being posed for the first time. Actor Nadji Jeter displays all the range needed for the role, continuing to excel as a younger Spider-Man maturing before our eyes. For Peter, these themes manifest in a much more physical sense. He's in his early twenties so has already navigated the difficult years that Miles finds himself in, but thanks to the symbiote suit, he's working his way through yet more bodily changes. This physical manifestation is also representative of mental health issues that have developed for each Spider-Man. Venom hangs over the main characters like a spectre of grief, drenching them in black as if in a state of mourning. The story does a great job at gently exploring these issues and how, when not healthily addressed, personal demons can eat at us and lead to people we care about being unintentionally caught in the crossfire of the anger and pain those feelings can produce. Of course, a hero is nothing without its villains, and Spider-Man's rogues gallery is almost unparalleled. Outside of the likes of Venom, Kraven, and Lizard seen in the trailers, Insomniac has kept many more cards hidden up its sleeve. I won't even hint at any of these except to say that Spider-Man 2 opens with a bang, offering up a sense of scale not previously seen in the series. It's an adrenaline-fuelled reintroduction to the series that tests how well you remember the combat, as well as providing a few new tricks. It's also the start of one of the new side-story villain threads that are optional, and while those don't offer anything overly new in terms of gameplay, they do add valuable extra scraps of story. They flesh out these villains, allowing fully formed characters to emerge where once they were merely one-and-done boss battle appearances. Speaking of boss battles, that’s one area that takes a noticeable step up from our initial tangos with Kingpin, Vulture, and the rest. One of my criticisms of the first in Insomniac's series was how uninspired many of the showdowns felt, with their quicktime-heavy fights making a light impact. Improvements were made in Miles Morales, but here in the full-fledged sequel, boss battles really come to life. You're made to wait a little too long for them sometimes, but when they do arrive they never fail to excite. They are evolving brawls packed full of danger that put all of your skills to the test. Dodges and parries are key, as well as using environmental tools dotted around the arenas for your benefit. The latter third of the campaign essentially becomes a boss rush mode that will put the sturdiest of thumbs to the test – not necessarily because it ever gets too difficult, but because of the sheer number of times you’ll be hammering that Square button. These later stages are where the majority of Spider-Man 2’s thrills lay, however, as it really hits its stride late on, and emphatically wraps up a tale with miles of emotional depth that never once threatens to peter out. The main story took me around 18 hours to complete before I hit 100%, and the subsequent platinum trophy popped up to congratulate my efforts after 27 in total. To earn that precious trophy, you’ll be spending a lot of time mopping up the many, many side activities that Spider-Man 2 throws your way – and while not everybody must or should do all of that, it’s a reminder that quantity doesn’t always equal quality. Despite whatever loftier ambitions the story may have, this is still unapologetically an old-school approach to open-world game design, and nowhere is this displayed more clearly than in its optional quests. To their credit, the way you can highlight side objectives by pressing the right stick is a welcome upgrade over mere icons on a map. Even without that, you can spot ominous clouds or glowing purple rooftops with the bare eye signaling activities are there to be found. This isn't a world that beckons exploration or discovery, necessarily, but it is a step in the right direction toward creating greater immersion and mercifully less time spent looking at the map screen. That being said, I can't help but have hoped for a few more flashes of Gotham City to make their way into New York. Something like the spontaneous shock of Manbat jumping at you out of nowhere went a long way to making Rocksteady's superhero open world feel more reactive than what we get here (even though it always cheated by finding ways to keep civilians off the streets). When you consider the evolution of open-world game design that the Arkham series took over the course of the trilogy, and its multilayered villain side quests, it’s a bit disappointing to see Insomniac’s series stuck in time when it comes to its side content and the way it presents itself to you. Standard open-world filler activities are here aplenty, and that’s one area where Spider-Man 2 hasn't moved with the times or shown ambition at all. Collectibles, photo opportunities, and rather basic street crimes are still here and, despite having a few slightly more interesting quirks this time around, they only very occasionally excite. You’ll regularly be stopping the same getaways with the same few button presses (the button-mashing from previous games is mercifully largely gone) or stopping a break-in by battering the same few goons. Granted, the additional enemy variety in play makes these activities take a little longer to get old than they did in the past, but that still isn't quite a strong enough twist to make prioritising photographing a couple of amateur cosplayers over saving a house full of people from a raging fire not seem ridiculous. Fun, quick side missions like helping a student ask their crush to homecoming or rescuing the Brooklyn Visions’ mascot from a rival school by solving a series of light and mirror puzzles add dashes of charm, but I'd love to see yet more life breathed into this world to match its visual splendor. These characters do add a bit more flavour to the world and its largely homogenous population of NPCs you’re clearly not intended to look at too closely. There are exceptions to the rule, however: there are a couple of more involved questlines that are much more nourishing, almost to the point of being a series of mini main plot missions. My favourite was The Flame questline, which begins with simply helping out the fire brigade, but quickly spins a layered and mysterious web. It's full of twists, turns, and surprises, like a great, short comic book run that separates itself from the rest of Spider-Man 2’s optional time trials and simple puzzle minigames. Rewards for completing these various activities vary, with some ranging from genuinely exciting story teases for what’s to come, to simply gaining some tech parts to upgrade your abilities with. The tasks are often so mundane and repetitive, however, that I did frequently question whether these small, congratulatory nuggets were worth the slog they too often turned out to be. All of this contributes to fighting back against crime in each district of New York, a city now twice the size of what we’ve seen before including the leafy residential roads of Queens and the bustling borough of Brooklyn. There are 14 unique districts, each with its own set of objectives to complete before you can unlock fast travel to that part of the map. Not making fast travel readily available is smart, and truthfully, I barely used it anyway as swinging and gliding around the city is so much more fun, even though the load times are nonexistent and the speedy, swooping camera effect of switching between Peter and Miles is very cool. Gliding is especially great for crossing long distances thanks to the numerous wind tunnels that carve their way through New York's seemingly endless grid of streets flanked by art deco architecture and modern mirror-like skyscrapers. Of course, if you’re going to be catching your ray-traced, 4K reflection (if you opt for the 30fps fidelity mode) in that glass so often, you’ll want to look your best. Fear not, because there are dozens and dozens of suits to unlock, with myriad colorful skins to pick from on each of them. From modern interpretations of classics to returning fan favourites, there are treats waiting for Spider-Man fans of all generations. They are now all pure cosmetics as well – a smart separation of form and function means picking the skills and abilities you equip are separate from your choice of suit. In keeping with Insomniac’s track record, the music behind it all is stellar, with Miles' and Peter's respective signature tunes playing depending on who you're controlling. A highlight, though, is the theme that follows in Kraven's footsteps, which bears more than a passing resemblance to Howard Shore's Uruk-hai war march from The Lord of the Rings score. It soundtracks a world that looks stunning, even when played in performance mode at a stable 60fps as I did for most of my playthrough. In fact, Spider-Man 2 is a technical marvel as a whole. From the near-instant load times, the ability to pinpoint a fast-travel location and be there in a second, atmospheric lighting, and crisp reflections, all of the pieces fit into place wonderfully – aside from the very occasional NPC getting stuck where they shouldn’t. I can't say that I noticed one dropped frame in my dozens of hours of playing. This allows Spider-Man 2 to shine in its most jaw-dropping moments – of which the main story offers many – as explosive action, sparkling electrical effects, and fittingly slimy symbiote gloop fill the screen. As a sequel in a spectacular series, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is both blessed and cursed. Its story of two Spider-Men is a great time and a Spidey fan’s dream to play through as comic book pages are brought to life, elegantly walking the tightrope between light humour and heavier themes. Meanwhile, Insomniac refines a successful formula of combat and web-swinging without revolutionising either in major ways, making them comfy and familiar with just enough new tweaks and abilities to elevate them to fun new heights. The part that feels like it actually needed a radical rethinking is the open world of New York City, which has been made bigger but not better, with an exhausting checklist of mostly repetitious side activities. But it’s safe to call this another thrilling Spider-Man adventure that delivers Insomniac's best tale yet, and despite its open world falling short, it's a reliably fun superhero power trip. And, you know what? Screw it. It really did make me feel like Spider-Man, too. "
15,Lords of the Fallen ,8.0,"If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again. While the original Lords of the Fallen from 2014 was one of the earliest to bravely take a stab at recreating FromSoftware’s lightning in a bottle, it didn’t quite hit that high mark. Nearly a decade and about a million soulslike copycats later, there’s perhaps no better time for its follow-up to take a second swipe – and thankfully, this new, confusingly identically named Lords of the Fallen confidently lands its strike. Its world, divided into dual realities, is absolutely awesome to explore, buildcrafting is diverse and complex, and combat is so smooth and satisfying that I’m willing to forgive all the ways it cribs from its contemporaries. Some pretty severe performance issues and bugs as well as disappointingly easy boss fights mean this latest thrust isn’t quite a fatal blow, but even so, I expect to spend many more hours impaling enemies and exploring every nook and cranny of its cleverly split world for secrets.   Lords of the Fallen is yet another entry in the action-RPG soulslike craze, complete with an unsettling fantasy setting, other players invading your game for some co-op or PvP goodness, and, of course, lots of dying. It makes use of the same sort of deadly third-person combat system full of dodge rolling, posture meters, and emoting over fallen enemies as a sign of utmost disrespect. A lot is borrowed from FromSoft classics (in this case, Dark Souls specifically), but there’s also quite a bit of unique stuff to get excited about, too. That includes things like some super cool dual-reality shenanigans, or a nifty magical lamp that lets you flay the souls right out of your enemies. And look, I know every time I review another one of these things, I always gripe about how absolutely flooded with new entries this genre is, but it really does bear repeating. There are a lot of these games nowadays. While more of a genre I enjoy isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it has become a tad disheartening to crack open a brand new game and feel like I already know exactly how 90% of it’s going to go because everyone’s using the same bag of tricks and tropes. It’s very weird, for example, that I can see a pile of boxes in the distance and think, “Ah, can’t wait for a monster to leap out from behind those and attack me,” or reach a swamp area and know, without question, that I’m going to be jumped by creatures who try to poison me. At this point I’ve started to lose track of which game’s healing items are called Estus Flasks vs. Dragon Hearts vs. Flasks of Crimson Tears vs. Pulse Cells vs. Healing Gourds and so on to eternity. If those names all ring a bell, expect plenty more deja vu here. If “Lords of the Fallen” sounds familiar to you as well, that’s because it shares its name with the 2014 game from developer Deck13 – but as the lack of a “2” or something similar might suggest, this Lords of the Fallen isn’t a sequel so much as a full on reboot. Those who played the original will definitely hear NPCs talk about some familiar (and sometimes nonsensical) setting terms like “The Rhogar” and “Adyr,” or see really cool and recognizable sights like the giant outstretched hand of a fallen god in the distance, but new developer Hexworks only used the most basic elements from the previous version. The good news is that this fresh story it’s telling using some refurbished, dusty bits is much better than its predecessor, and the world feels much more fleshed out. There’s some interesting characters here and there and some cool lore and worldbuilding to enjoy as you meet various factions that you can side with or work against, even if that stuff sometimes feels buried under a mountain of generic dark fantasy gobbledegook (like the super original concept of using “Charred Fingers” when invading other players’ world). Though Lords of the Fallen certainly borrows a lot from its genre peers, its biggest original idea is also its best: the dual realms you can swap between at any time. Axiom, the physical world most people perceive, lies atop a ghostly world of dark abominations and creepy eyeballs called Umbral which you can access using a magic lantern. As you run around killing bosses and kicking scrubs off of ledges, you’ll need to navigate both, which adds a really novel new way to explore the environment. For example, you might encounter a broken bridge in the normal world, but by diving into Umbral you’ll be able to cross it using an organic, gray platform only visible and tangible by entering the spooky world of darkness – it sorta reminds me of the eerie plane Frodo enters when he puts on the One Ring, except a lot more useful and less out of focus. This mechanic has an enormous impact on nearly every aspect of Lords of the Fallen, from combat where normally imperceivable enemies become a major threat when you enter Umbral, to exploration since each area essentially has two versions, warranting multiple runs through the same section to see what you missed. Lords of the Fallen delivers entertaining hack-and-slash combat centered on combos and spells, but its risk-based reward system seems slightly out of place in a world where its hero so easily achieves great power and defense and makes risk obsolete. It achieves its goal of creating a more accessible Dark Souls-style experience, but unfortunately it goes a step or two too far.  Even cooler is the fact that you can interact with the Umbral plane without entering it, by holding your trusty lamp to see a small piece of it come into view around you. Doing so allows you to do things like pass through physical barriers that don’t exist in the other world and get a sneak preview of stuff that might lie hidden on the other side before switching over fully. This makes exploration less about running from point A to point B and more about taking your time to understand each area and look for secrets as you swap between realities and use your lamp to shed light on how they differ. It’s also pretty awesome that if you ever get slain by the enemy, instead of dying, you’ll be involuntarily pulled into Umbral, giving you one last chance at life. To escape back to the real world, you have to find totems hidden throughout this shadowy one or return to a checkpoint to rest, but more and more powerful enemies begin to infinitely spawn and hunt you down the longer you stick around. It’s a shame, though, that Lords of the Fallen doesn’t quite seem capable of supporting its cross-dimensional ambitions from a technical standpoint, as it suffers some pretty serious performance issues in the attempt. Even with my GeForce RTX 4090 GPU and Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPU, I encountered stuttering and dropped frames on a fairly regular basis, especially after prolonged sessions. Sometimes these issues were so consistent I felt serious eye strain and had to reboot my PC in hopes things would improve at least for a little while, and the problems were shared in some form or another by everyone I played with. It’s especially frustrating when lost frames lead to me taking hits I otherwise may have avoided, or when my co-op partners got killed after their game turned into a slideshow during multiplayer (where performance is sometimes even worse). I’m not usually one to whinge about performance benchmarks or less-than-perfect framerates, but these were so consistent and impossible to ignore that it was like eating a delicious meal with a severe toothache and a cut on the roof of my mouth. I hope this sort of stuff will be patched out before too long, but for now, those severe problems are impossible to ignore. Thankfully these areas are still a ton of fun to explore when Lords the Fallen’s framerate manages to behave, from the fiery ashes of the city of Calrath to the treacherous steps of a monastery in the mountains. Level design is some of the best of the genre in recent memory, with interesting (and often breathtaking) environments, tons of secrets to discover, and loads of unique enemies to fight, introduced one at a time via miniboss fights throughout the roughly 40-hour campaign. Lords of the Fallen also draws clear inspiration from the first Dark Souls specifically, in that it tries very hard to connect every area of the map to a central hub, and has lots of opportunities to unlock shortcuts and backtracking paths – though it does so at the cost of being annoyed by about 15 doors that can’t be opened from the side you’re on every hour or so. Taking down armies of wretched skeletal abominations is a lively whirlwind of blades and flails being swung and parried, making it play more smoothly than the vast majority of its peers, even if that dance feels extremely conventional at this point. You can be a brawny bruiser wielding the ol’ reliable sword and board, a quick and precise Bloodborne dude, or a variety of ranged magic users with cool but by-the-numbers abilities like covering levels in fire and lava or blessing you and your allies with health regenerating effects. Upgrading weapons, spells, and slotting runes and other upgrades into your equipment to give them special modifiers helps extend that buildcrafting variety even further. With nine starting character classes to choose from (and four more that can be unlocked later) there’s tons of room for replayability and a variety of interesting playstyles, which is one of my favorite aspects of any action-RPG.  It’s also great that many of the areas you’ll fight your way though are legitimately challenging, often filled with elite enemies who swarm you with devastating attacks in claustrophobic environments that have numerous ways to get yourself killed. Getting pulled into the Umbral realm piles on even more enemies and danger too, which is a fun, sweat-inducing time. Really the only issue is that enemies are as dumb as a bag of hair, which isn’t exactly a unique problem in the genre, but it’s always amusing to see these morons try to figure out how to navigate the world’s geometry only to stand in place as you repeatedly hit them with balls of lightning. Not content with just being awesome for exploration, your magical lamp and its relationship to the parallel Umbral realm is also quite useful in combat, primarily because you can use its Soul Flay ability to rip out an enemy’s soul, stopping them in their tracks and providing ample time to dish out damage. If you’re feeling more rude, you can even toss their soul over a cliff, so when their body finally catches up they fall to their death – extremely useful for disposing of troublesome baddies foolish enough to engage you near a cliff’s edge. Also, some enemies will have supernatural protection that makes them nigh invincible, the only remedy being using your lamp to cast light on a nearby hidden eyeball to strip them of that protection. Finding ways to play with the dual-reality swapping during combat really drives home just how dope that mechanic is. Another neat new idea is Vestige Seeds, which can be planted in various designated locations throughout the world to manifest semi-permanent checkpoints at intervals of your choosing. So if you’re having trouble with a certain section and don’t want to deal with the pressure of dying before you reach the next static checkpoint, you can use a Vestige Seed to create a safe haven along the way and take baby steps to your final destination. This adds a really nice minigame where you’re deciding when to stop and spend a seed, and when to push your luck and see if you can make it through the next few rooms before saving your progress. And obviously no soulslike would be complete without epic boss fights against disgusting monstrosities, and Lords of the Fallen has some cool ones, such as a a giant crow who tries to bury you in ice or a dragon-riding abomination who shows up to hunt you down throughout your adventure. Unfortunately, unlike the levels preceding them, they’re not very challenging at all. Every boss comes at you with slow and telegraphed moves, surprisingly reasonable health bars, and plenty of breaks in the action to heal up thanks to the simple AI, making death a pretty rare occurrence against them. Many of these fights only really serve to introduce a new elite enemy that will be used more regularly later on, too, making them pretty unremarkable. It’s still entertaining to take on enormous beasts despite them being pushovers, but even some of the more unique fights seem subpar compared to the bar set by recent soulslikes.  There’s also just a pretty sizable layer of jank around this otherwise awesome package. I saw a few game crashes, had cool combat encounters ruined when enemies got stuck helplessly in the environment, was locked out of certain button commands like blocking for stretches of time, and more. Plus, there’s some weird non-bug wonkiness, like how resting at a checkpoint triggers a loading screen every single time – sometimes Lords of the Fallen has original Dark Souls energy in a pretty unflattering way. Playing with a friend can make some of those rough edges even more noticeable, since it introduces other questionable quirks, like how co-op partners are tethered to the host and get teleported if they stray too far, which is accompanied by a loading screen. But these loading screens often take just long enough for the host to have traveled out of sight again by the time you load back in… leading to yet another loading screen. You also can’t tell where the host is due to a bizarre lack of any kind of in-world indicator pointing you in your friend’s direction, making it easy to lose sight of them and become separated.  That said, playing with a friend is still a good time, and provides the assisting player with plenty of resources and items along the way – and without kicking them back to their own world after every boss fight, as FromSoft games often do. What I’ve played of New Game+ so far also has me and my squad quite excited to go back through some of the areas and enemies, with new lore, a whole new skill tree to experiment with, and, of course, more difficult baddies to slay. That increased difficulty hasn’t made any of the boss fights very challenging yet, which is a bummer, but the stretches between them are worth it on their own. Lords of the Fallen is a great soulslike, and its killer new idea of swapping between two versions of the world to solve puzzles and slay enemies is an excellent twist to set it apart from the pack. That concept is unfortunately hamstrung by numerous, highly annoying technical issues and weak boss fights, but awesome explorable areas and fantastic buildcrafting more than make up for those shortcomings. If, like me, you’re a sucker for a quality action-RPG even amid a clear overabundance of them, then this reboot is well worth your time. "
16,Total War: Pharaoh ,8.0,"The most impressive part of Total War: Pharaoh isn't the beautifully-detailed map of the Nile Valley, the exciting Late Bronze Age setting, or the striking interface that looks like it was copied straight off of a tomb wall in the Valley of Kings. It's the fact that Creative Assembly Sophia has pulled me right back into a fairly traditional, historical Total War and made it feel like a fresh experience, even when I've been playing this series for over 20 years now. It has some rough edges, especially the further you get from the heart of Egypt. But that little bit of sand in my sandals is easy to endure when Pharaoh is at its best. Egypt itself is really the star of Total War: Pharaoh, and whether you're on the campaign or the battle map, it makes its personality known with wonderful art, effective lighting, and challenging geography. It would be easy to imagine dozens of repetitive battles fought on bumpy sand, but there are many riffs on the general themes of sunbaked flood plains and rocky desert peaks that lend a sense of place and new tactical possibilities. I particularly came to enjoy hiding my troops just behind the sharp crest of a soaring sand dune when facing an army with elite archers, only springing the trap when they were close enough that their ranged advantage was meaningless.  The winding snake of the Nile and the inhospitable deserts on either side strongly shaped every strategic decision I made, too. Sailing the river itself is by far the fastest way to get anywhere, so sticking close to it is like having access to a super highway. It cuts both ways, though. Especially later on when the Sea People are invading in force, they can swiftly slink upriver to bypass your strongest defenses, which led to some exciting chases to catch them before they could torch the soft underbelly of my empire. On the other end of the spectrum, crossing open desert with no established paths causes appropriately punishing attrition unless you stop and camp regularly, which can slow you down to a crawl. Cleverly, every settlement is connected by roads to somewhere. But on the fringes, they're often not connected to their closest neighbors as the crow flies. You may even need to go two or three provinces North or South to find an ideal route, so speed versus safety was always an interesting consideration. Add in the near-constant threat of Libyan invaders in the West, always targeting my hardest-to-access settlements, and I really felt the welcome pressure I'm looking for in a Total War grand campaign. Relative to other recent Total Wars, Pharaoh is noticeably more challenging. I often play on Very Hard in Warhammer 3, and I found that even stepping down to Hard in this one gave me enough pushback that I had to start four or five campaigns before I really got a good run going. That's a satisfying balance point. Starting in the South as the Kushite Viceroy Amenmesse, the civil wars and foreign invasions bleeding Egypt dry kept me on my toes for more than 100 turns before my snowball – or is it a sandball? – got too big to be stopped. I was a bit disappointed by the last, huge, apocalyptic wave of the Sea People invasion, as I was able to deal with it fairly easily by that point. But to be fair, I had all of Lower Egypt, at the mouth of the Nile, serving as a filter between me and the sea. If I was hanging out in the delta, I might have had a more thrilling endgame. Even if the Sea People weren't ruining my day directly, their burning of city centers outside my borders was definitely felt even down in Nubia. The Bronze Age Collapse is modeled by a bar that slides from prosperity, to crisis, to collapse, with stacking bonuses for the invaders and penalties for the settled factions the lower it goes. The idea that I was making my way up the Nile and rebuilding civilization as I went, pulling the world out of a dark age punctuated by eerie changes in sound and lighting, served as a decent motivation to keep pushing even after I'd achieved my standard victory objectives and was too strong to really be challenged. The richness of the campaign is enhanced by what may be the most in-depth set of empire management mechanics in any Total War so far. There's a whole new layer to every settlement for outposts, which are smaller sub-buildings that have their own physical location, and can be anything from the unique Valley of the Kings monument to a fort that can be staffed with a full stack of defending troops. The latter allowed me to defend some very far-flung areas without needing to station a general, and changed how I approached offensive wars. In a province with a fort, you usually want to ""set a pick"" with a smaller army, to borrow a sports term, and then go after the main settlement with your larger army, so you don't have to fight both garrisons at once. The ability to build waystations, trading posts, and temples, which give you some movement points back once visited, can also create a speedy overland travel network in the developed areas of your empire – but a single raid to knock out one link in the chain may leave your armies stranded. This all speaks to the cleverness and care with which CA Sophia has layered more interesting decisions and play style choices onto this venerable formula. And that's without even digging into the robust, hands-on systems for court politics, civil wars, and earning the favor of the gods. Some of these mechanics are afflicted by a minor plague of bugs, though. I got to use my Legacy power, following in the footsteps of Thutmose the Conqueror, only once before it seemed to freeze up and never grant me any rewards for my future victories. One of the powers you unlock after becoming Pharaoh that is supposed to allow you to forcibly annex smaller factions of your culture simply wasn't usable on anyone, and the tooltip became a blank, white box, so I couldn't even figure out why. Influence, which determines how dominant your culture is in a region, is also a very opaque mechanic with inadequate tooltips that can really only be mastered through trial and error. And unfortunately, a lot of the best aspects of the campaign only shine brightly if you're playing in Egypt. To be fair, Egypt itself is a massive, fulfilling canvas to paint the story of your empire upon. In my 120+ turns as Amenmesse, I didn't even reach the borders of Canaan. But the peripheral areas beyond the Sinai Peninsula definitely didn't get the same attention and flavor. It'd be a bit unfair to say they feel tacked on, but this is definitely a game about Egypt where everyone else is a side story. Each region looks just as beautiful and detailed as the Nile. The green mountain valleys of Hatti almost feel like a different world when you've been choking on dust in the Sahara for ages. But they also feel cramped, and weirdly cut off. For instance, the playable part of Anatolia slices off the Western and Northern coasts of the peninsula, which just feels awkward and unnatural. Even in Egypt's case, I wouldn't say the spot they chose to end the map in the South makes much sense, missing the ancient city of Meroë that was hugely important to the Kingdom of Kush, which features prominently in Egyptian politics. And having a game about the Late Bronze Age that doesn't include the Mesopotamian heavy-hitters like Assyria, Elam, and Babylon – just off the edge of Pharaoh's map – gives the whole epic an aftertaste of incompleteness. I genuinely hope we get some DLC that takes things a bit further East. The outer regions also lack the political richness of Egypt. The Hittities only have two playable characters and two Ancient Legacies to pursue, compared to Egypt's four and four. That means there are really only four different playstyles for them, compared to Egypt's 16, since you can mix and match any legacy with any character. Suppulilumia is a punishingly difficult but interesting run as you try to salvage a collapsing kingdom, but I never got over the feeling of being boxed in by the weird map borders. And the geography of Anatolia doesn't create the same interesting, strategic puzzles as Egypt. Canaan doesn't even have its own royal traditions. Bay is basically an Egyptaboo who wants to become Egyptian himself – which is good, in a way, because it points him toward a more interesting part of the map. But if you want to play a Canaanite who stays in Canaan, you're basically stuck with Irsu. And I hope you like raiding, because that's his entire thing. I didn't enjoy what I played of his campaign much. At least every faction has a wide roster to pull from, and the many cultures sprinkled across the world each offer something different. The Hittites are the masters of the heavily-armored infantry line. Kush and Nubia have by far the best archers. Even within Egypt and Hatti there are multiple subcultures with their own native units which can be recruited simply by owning a settlement in the right area, regardless of which faction you are. This allows building multi-ethnic armies that combine the strengths of many tribes, which is thematically and tactically satisfying. The pacing of the battles is great, too, with infantry engagements slowed down noticeably from other recent Total Wars. I always prefer that, since it allows more room to maneuver and make small, clutch plays to eke out a win. Unit weight classes mix up the typical rock-paper-scissors dynamic of swords, spears, and bows, with light but fast infantry often able to chase down and overwhelm units that are more powerful on paper. The fact that armor can now be worn down and damaged throughout a battle gives a new role to club and mace units, as they specialize in exactly that. And the addition of weather effects like thunderstorms and sandstorms is not only visually awesome, but can turn the tide for one side or another. Chariots are… still chariots. The amount of micro required to get the most out of them generally makes them not worth using at all. We're in an age before cavalry, so they're the most mobile units you'll ever get access to. But I just don't enjoy playing with them, nor have I ever in any Total War game. How would you fix this? I'm not sure. But until they do, I'd almost always rather have one more unit of infantry. Total War: Pharaoh looks incredible, with diverse and interesting battles complemented by an uncommonly deep and rich campaign layer. The focus is firmly on Egypt, and the experiences available outside that region don't really match up in terms of content or quality to what is on offer to the civilizations of the Nile. But when I'm sailing up and down that majestic river, fending off invasions from hostile tribes, politicking my way to the top of the power pyramid, and sending my besandaled soldiers to spill blood across the shining sands, I feel confident in saying historical Total War is back, baby. Creative Assembly Sophia has refined every part of its take on this franchise since Troy, and the results are just shy of glorious. "
17,Detective Pikachu Returns ,6.0,"When Detective Pikachu hit the 3DS in 2016, we’d never seen anything quite like it in the vast collection of Pokemon games. Its casual whodunit story was an easy solve, but it was cute, colorful, and most importantly, different. And yet, now that Detective Pikachu and his tiny herringbone hat have returned, it doesn’t feel as exciting as its predecessor. In fact, there’s a lot about the mystery solving that’s arguably a step backwards. It’s somehow easier than the first one, which makes a lot of the moment-to-moment play feel long-winded and a bit frustrating, especially if you’re more than 10 years old. It’s still a pleasing, colorful, sweet adventure, and the story comes to a mostly satisfying conclusion of the Detective Pikachu saga, but its greatest mystery is what went on behind the scenes that resulted in some of these baffling decisions in the story and mechanics.   Since it’s been a good while, it was wise for this sequel to be written so that you didn’t need to play the first Detective Pikachu (or seen the movie, for that matter) to hop into Returns – Pikachu recaps the first game in the very beginning with his trusty cup of coffee by his side. The world is still feeling the effects of the events from the first game, where Tim Goodman and the titular detective helped stop the spread of R, a drug that caused Pokemon to go berserk. However, things seem to be ramping up again in Ryme City, where Pokemon are once again acting strangely and a mystery is brewing in the background as you solve other cases. Plus, there’s the matter of figuring out what happened to Tim’s father and Pikachu’s partner, Harry. Unlike in the first game, where R was introduced early and the mystery involved who was behind it, Detective Pikachu Returns tries something different. It introduces a lot of parts early on without specifically revealing the purpose of the puzzling objects at its center, and then takes its time explaining their meaning. Without getting into too many details, a priceless gem is stolen, but then that stone becomes central to the larger events, but its true purpose remains unknown for most of my estimated 17-hour runtime. Even though there are a lot of other moving parts, it’s not too complicated to figure out their places in the plot, and it’s still satisfying to watch them come together. It’s a bit predictable, though, and you’ll very likely figure it out way before the characters do. Detective Pikachu Returns does manage to pull off a few surprises by subverting some obvious mystery tropes around butlers perpetrating crimes, and alliances shift unexpectedly. But it’s still a story where the most obvious suspect in each case is likely the culprit, and the ending you expect is what you typically get. As I mentioned, this is a family-oriented visual novel, so none of the cases are too complex. In fact, it seems like Nintendo has taken it down a notch from the first one, which was already clearly targeted at younger players. Gone are many of the more complicated puzzles and how the clues and evidence are laid out. Previously, you had to sometimes approach an investigation by picking apart a conversation and highlighting a word, or having to decipher symbols that even Detective Pikachu won’t reveal the answer to. Gathering clues in Detective Pikachu Returns is even more straightforward: you collect them and then Pikachu prompts you to deduce what they mean together in your new case notebook. For example, you’ll wander around Ryme City collecting testimony from witnesses or looking closer at certain crime scenes for anything amiss, but it’s unlikely you’ll interact with any of the evidence beyond that. You also get optional side quests where you can help out people and pokemon, and while they’re not necessary for the plot, they’re usually good for a laugh – the exception being a quiz professor who, all too often, has you backtracking to interact with Pokemon in the area to solve her relatively easy riddles. I occasionally got tripped up when I wasn’t paying close attention to a conversation that had gone on too long, but for the most part, the clues are presented and then explained almost immediately. Is there a diagram that shows a person lifting a Pokemon up to unlock a door? You’ll probably have to lift up Pikachu to unlock a door. Did a bunch of Pokemon report that they fell asleep after eating breakfast? That’s probably important to remember. And if you don't get it correct the first time, you aren’t punished for your mistake – you just try again until you get it right. Returns doesn’t really have puzzles, but rather a series of testimonies you have to collect and keep track of. Pikachu, Tim, and the rest of the characters need every piece of evidence to have realizations, so like the last game, you’re forced to break down your entire thought process in the notebook. Detective Pikachu offers a bold take on the iconic Pokemon, which succeeds thanks to Pika Prompts that build Pikachu beyond detective stereotypes. Even though I figured out cases far before their end, each one utilized the world of Pokemon to its fullest, and ultimately offered a unique Pokemon experience that I hope we see done again soon. – Miranda Sanchez, March 22 It’s not that it’s that difficult to keep everything organized, just inconvenient. Previously, you could view your notes and make deductions on the second of the two 3DS screens even if you were in a conversation; on the Switch’s single screen you have to jump into menus to view them instead. This might not sound like a huge change, but it does mean that you’re unlikely to look at evidence as you go. Granted, you probably won’t need to look at your notes much since most answers to questions are more obvious than Tim or Pikachu realize, but I only hopped into the menu when I had found every clue and Pikachu said it was time to start deducing. It was also just not fun to look at. At least the first game’s notebook featured Tim’s line drawings and looked like a yellow-lined piece of paper. Now, it just looks like a generic video game menu covered in tiny polaroids. The get-out-of-jail-free card is that all of this simplicity is fine if you’re making a game for younger players. People who are looking for a laidback time also might not mind it. But at the same time, Detective Pikachu Returns is kind of a dark story. The first one didn’t shy away from some mature storytelling moments, and it’s not outside the Pokemon franchise’s purview to feature pokemon getting kidnapped, trafficked, or tortured, but I was taken aback when I realized where Returns was going. Without revealing what happens in the second half, it goes to some places I wasn’t expecting to see in a game that’s ostensibly for children. It doesn’t handle a lot of its themes delicately either, but then again, Pokemon isn’t exactly known for its nuance. It just makes you wonder: who is this for? Why would they make the gameplay simpler and the story darker? Another one of the biggest disappointments with Detective Pikachu Returns is its art style. Pokemon games aren’t renowned for being gorgeous or intricate, especially over the past couple generations, but Returns looks more like a 3DS game than the original did, and that actually was a 3DS game. It’s especially lacking when it comes to facial animations – each character has maybe two expressions and they’re both neutral, which can be a problem when tragic or dire events are happening. It’s tough to get invested in the actual high stakes of the story when Tim just looks slightly shocked. But you’re likely not playing a Pokemon game for dazzling sights, and at the very least, this is still an improvement over the first one. The lines are cleaner, the colors are brighter, and the character movement is smoother. The animations are even detailed when they need to be.. Pikachu, for example, has an adorable little run where his head leans back and his whole body juts forward, which made me giggle every time he hustled around the screen. There are moments where he rides around on the backs of other pokemon to solve puzzles and get through previously cut-off areas, and the way the artists chose to integrate him with each is unique to that pokemon’s features. At the very least, Detective Pikachu Returns has moments where it’s visually charming, and a couple where it can even elicit laughs.  Like with the first one, the pokemon are why you play, and there are so many to discover here including return favorites like Mewtwo and others from across the spectrum of rarity and types. Some you just get to talk to, but others are a big help, and most manage to stand out despite little screentime. And because the Pokemon series has always been about how pokemon are special in their own unique ways, each one has their own abilities to lend. Growlithe, which is one of the first you get to hang out with, has a keen sense of smell that lets her find objects or other pokemon, while Darmanitan can break down rocks and other barriers while you ride around in the fluff on his head. Pikachu is the most special of all, of course. That hasn’t changed. The story is about him, after all, so it only makes sense that he gets the best scenes and dialogue. It’s a joy whenever he gets one of his “bolts of brilliance” and has to strike a pose or when he gets snarky. Even with just a couple short conversations, Detective Pikachu Returns manages to flesh out its world at least a little bit by imbuing random pokemon with personality and a desire for connection or happiness. The human characters, sadly, don’t get the same treatment. Tim is as dull as ever, just following around Pikachu and commenting on events with a straight face. We meet new characters like Rachel, who tags along on many of your investigations, but she too mostly just follows you around and doesn’t contribute much else at all. Detective Pikachu Returns is overall, though, a Pokemon game, so maybe it’s fine that the humans are no more animated than a block of wood. And it nails the tenets of the series. It’s about friendship, community, generosity, and making the world better for pokemon as well as humans. It might sound trite, but sometimes that’s nice to see. The mystery story of Detective Pikachu Returns makes some bizarre and unexpectedly dark choices to get to its underwhelmingly predictable conclusion, and as a result it’s unclear who this is all for. Is it for young kids who will find the simplified puzzles about right, or adults who grew up with Pikachu and can handle the more mature themes of the second half? It’s still a cute, bubbly, animated adventure with humor, unique pokemon to meet, and a mystery to solve, but the mystery solving is long-winded, the visuals are lackluster, and the gameplay is so basic it might as well not be there at all. "
18,Forza Motorsport ,8.0,"Sitting on the grid in my 2017 Holden V8 Supercar, surrounded by Lamborghinis, Ferraris, and Audi R8s, I have to concede I’m feeling a little underqualified. Forza Motorsport’s online multiplayer spec racing should technically place all these cars on a level field, but I can’t help but feel like I’ve brought a cricket bat to a swordfight here. Several mediocre laps later and neither myself or my Vegemite-eating VF Commodore have troubled the timesheets much, finishing mid-pack one spot below where I started – but I’m sweating, and I’m smiling. The 2023 version of Forza Motorsport is brimming with new features across the board, from its muscular new multiplayer to its much-improved handling. All except for its upgrades, that is. They’ve been downgraded. Confused? Me too. Forza Motorsport is, by a significant margin, the best feeling game in the Motorsport franchise to date. It isn’t necessarily a total reinvention of the Forza formula, and it still has that familiar level of forgiveness baked into it when you’re at and just beyond the limits of control. This is a series that has always been about letting us have the confidence to grab a car by the scruff of its neck and step the rear end out with a boot-full of throttle without constantly over-rotating, and that’s absolutely still the case here. The improvements before we break traction, however, are marked.  If the previous game, Forza Motorsport 7, has any noticeable handling blemishes, it’d be that there’s often a lack of bite to the feeling of grip. Six years later, that’s totally gone here in this follow-up. The feeling of grip in Forza Motorsport is far more pronounced and authentic, and cars feel more realistically rooted to the road than they ever have previously. Push beyond the capacity of your tyres and grip will now taper away instead of falling off a cliff, meaning cars squirm more and skate less – which is a great improvement. The pleasing side-effect of these terrific tyre modelling improvements goes beyond making racing feel more accurate; it also actually makes it feel easier to drive fast. ‘Easy’ is too often used as a pejorative in a gaming context but, with respect to those who can’t feel feelings until they’re being flayed alive by a FromSoft game, in racing terms I can assure you it’s not a contemptuous concept. Lapping as fast as the pros, millimetre perfect and at maximum attack? No, that’s not simple – if it was, we’d all have yachts in Monaco by now. But hustling around a track quick and hard, confident the car beneath you is going to behave as it should? That’s well within the means of a competent driver. The old sim racing mentality that “if it’s not difficult, it’s not realistic” is something that most good driving simulators have been moving away from for some time, and Forza Motorsport is no exception. It’s easier because it’s more authentic. Gamepad handling is extremely well-refined. While it’s hardly a surprise considering good gamepad handling has always been a staple of this long-running series, I’m happy to report it remains top-notch and has survived the physics updates beneath the surface. As usual, the team at Turn 10 has struck a terrific balance between softening things like rapid weight transfer and certain steering inputs to keep the handling tameable on a tiny analogue stick, but still demanding an indisputable deftness to drive consistently fast. On a wheel, my experience is limited to the Thrustmaster TS-XW Racer – but it definitely errs extremely heavy out of the box. Surprisingly so, in fact. The last time my actual car felt this heavy to pilot it was because my alternator failed and killed my power steering. It is, however, extremely tuneable – so I was able to eventually dial that aggressive heaviness out and enjoy what I otherwise consider the best Forza Motorsport wheel feel I’ve ever experienced. There might be a slight numbness to severe kerbs, but the responsiveness and stability is excellent. The feeling of car weight is also great – especially on undulating and technical track sections like cresting over the rise at Laguna Seca before slamming down through the corkscrew. There are some small, welcome touches for wheel users, too. Those who play in cabin-view with the wheel visible may be happy to see the steering animation is no longer locked to just 90 degrees in either direction. The on-screen wheel now rotates up to 360 degrees, which is far more realistic. There are also car-specific force feedback and steering lock settings in the tuning menus, making it easier to keep cars feeling right without constantly re-adjusting the global settings. There’s more good news on tuning, including a new layer of suspension settings as well as the ability to add ballast. Adding ballast obviously increases car weight and lowers its performance index overall, but it is automatically distributed throughout the car to bring it closer to a perfect 50/50 weight distribution. It’s impossible to instantly gauge the impact the addition of ballast will have on competitive car builds, but it will be interesting to watch and experiment to see whether pushing a car over the limit before handicapping it with extra weight is a viable strategy on certain tracks. Unfortunately, that’s currently where the positive news on tuning – or perhaps more specifically, customisation – largely stops. That’s because upgrades are no longer all immediately available for any car by default, like they are in Forza Motorsport 7 or Forza Horizon 5. Instead, they’re frugally rationed out for each car as you spend seat time in them and earn experience for that specific vehicle. They’re also no longer purchased with credits, either; rather, each car will have a set amount of ‘Car Points’ that applying upgrades eats away at. The amount of Car Points you have per car will be determined by each car’s individual level, which tops out at 50. Upgrades are always made available in the same order, but it takes several hours of driving to unlock things like engine swaps (40), body kits (45), and drivetrain swaps (50). By design, this overtly RPG-style approach is meant to encourage us to form more profound connections with a narrower assortment of cars that mean something to us personally instead of bouncing around. In practice, however, it’s just a bit bothersome. Sure, it never feels as trivial as, say, the luck-based upgrade systems under the hood of arcade racers like The Crew series or Need for Speed Payback; we’re still in control of the parts we choose to “purchase” and fit. And sure, at car level 50 with the full range of parts available, the upgrade system in Forza Motorsport is essentially the same as it’s been for generations. The problem is getting there is now an unexpected treadmill, for every individual car (including duplicates of the same car). I do appreciate Forza Motorsport’s “built, not bought” philosophy, but the new layer of gamification here isn’t really for me. It’s not so much the Car Point system itself – I actually think there’s a decent amount of merit in some kind of system that’s perhaps roughly analogous to time sunk. Anyone who’s ever spent time wrenching on a car will know that you can’t do everything at once, and Car Points do mean you have to slowly add and swap parts over time – just like in real-life. What I don’t really get is the concept of gating away upgrades in a strict order – especially the super straightforward ones. Why do we really need a certain car level before we can yank out the spare wheel to shave some kilos? It definitely dilutes the previous freedom we had to focus on the upgrades we predict would make the most meaningful difference to a car’s performance from the outset, and it’s all bit silly that I’m measuring fuel loads by the millilitre to slice bonus thousandths of a second off my lap times when I’m still lugging around a spare tyre in the boot. Fortunately, you will earn car levels anywhere you use them, whether that’s career mode, free play, or multiplayer, so you’re never spinning your wheels on progression as long as you’re driving. The career mode is made up of several tiers of themed racing events that are otherwise fairly typically categorised by car class for this type of racing sim. With compulsory practice sessions ahead of each race it takes quite a while to move through each tour, so I’ve been busy for a while and will continue to be for some time. The ability to select your specific place on the grid before each event may seem like a peculiar replacement for qualifying, but it does mean that you can have the exact racing experience you want each race. That is, if you want the old-school, Gran Turismo-style experience that’s more like an overtaking challenge than a race – where you’ll need to thread your car all the way to the front from the back of the pack in just a few laps – go for it. If you’re interested in faster AI and dogfighting all race for a single spot, that’s also possible. It’s a smart touch, and it’s a more robust single-player racing experience than the likes of GT7 as a result.  Microsoft pitched Forza Motorsport 7 as the ultimate automotive playset, and it’s hard to argue otherwise. With enough cars to fill a dozen museums and the most generous selection of tracks to date in the series, the amount of driving, experimenting, and racing here is absolutely mammoth. Accessible as always for beginners but crammed with content targeted at lifelong car junkies, Forza Motorsport 7 is Turn 10’s finest love letter to speed and style this generation, no matter what language you speak. That said, I have found the event intros are a little overblown; there’s a hushed reverence to them that car manufacturers probably love, but they’re pretty stiff and starchy compared with the more casual automotive culture shows I stream or watch on YouTube these days. There are also a few car categories that don’t seem to really get much of a run in the career mode, but I would expect the career mode to grow as this Forza Motorsport platform evolves. In the meantime, free play is still here – where you can do quick races in any of the 500 available cars – but again I’d really love some simple options to better curate what the AI drives against me. There are so many specific fields to edit to narrow down your opponent’s cars, but it’s all but impossible to get the 23 specific rival cars you want. Often it just ignores my custom settings entirely. Just let us place the AI in cars we choose, like Forza Motorsport 4 did. Forza Motorsport’s 500-car roster is slimmer than Forza Motorsport 7 and Forza Horizon 5 – both of which feature over 700 apiece – and, yes, there are probably conversations to be had. For instance, there’s been pruning when it comes to offroaders, and hot pick-ups like the GMC Syclone and the HSV Maloo appear to have been collateral damage. Lancia is MIA despite making a welcome return to Horizon 5 just last month. You could pick at the seams for some time. However, to be quite fair, Forza Motorsport does achieve this 500-car figure without the cheeky level of double, triple, and sometimes quadruple dipping some of its rivals do when it comes to counting certain models multiple times due to different paint jobs. It really still is an enviable roster of rides, all of which bark and crackle brilliantly thanks to some serious strides with the sound. Better still, there’s no shortcut to buy them with obscene amounts of real-world money: pay attention, Gran Turismo 7. They also look sharp and marvellous in motion. I played largely in Performance RT mode on Xbox Series X, which adds ray-traced reflections of other cars and nearby objects to the glossy surfaces of your vehicle at the cost of resolution (but not frame-rate, which never budged from 60fps). That said, I’ve probably missed out on a good portion of the visual feast here since I don’t typically play the Motorsport games in chase cam. If you favour 4K above all else, Performance mode drops ray-tracing during racing (and still runs at a resolute 60fps). A third mode packs in additional ray-tracing on other environmental objects but runs at 30fps. But hey, don’t scoff: so does Driveclub, and look how well the aesthetics of that have stood the test of time, even a decade later! It ultimately may come down to personal preference, and I don’t know whether overall Forza Motorsport quite has the measure of GT7, but damned if it doesn’t look particularly spectacular at midnight under heavy rain. Each of Forza Motorsport’s 20 track locations features support for dynamic time-of-day and variable weather, and they definitely have been dressed with more detail than ever before, with 3D crowds and more trackside objects and fixtures. It is a slimmer selection than the 30+ locations we had in Forza Motorsport 7, although it has been confirmed further tracks will be injected in the future for free. Yas Marina is coming back next month, another unannounced track will follow in December, and the famous Nurburgring Nordschleife will reportedly be ready by spring in the northern hemisphere, 2024. Still, no Bathurst right now? That Bath-hurts. Equally painful is the lack of two-player splitscreen, which is a mode my kids and I have traditionally had a massive soft spot for. They particularly love zany handicap races, like giving away massive head starts to ancient hatchbacks and then chasing them down in hypercars – which is precisely the kind of experimentation that sandbox racers with garages as exhaustively broad as Forza Motorsport is usually brilliant for. I presume splitscreen is simply a niche mode in 2023 and it probably comes at too high a performance cost on the Series S, but it really is a little gloomy whenever gaming seems to go backwards. Hell, Gran Turismo had splitscreen in 1997! The trade-off here is a massively improved online multiplayer component, with scheduled racing events packaged up as full race weekends, with a practice session, a three-lap qualifying blast, and a race. There’s spec racing, where all the cars are automatically tuned identically by Turn 10 for an even playing field, and open racing where you take your own builds. I’ve been playing the Touring Car and GT spec racing series over the past week and it’s been extremely robust and reliable, especially considering the pools of players I’ve been racing have largely been developers and other press located on the other side of Earth’s largest ocean. It’s a little hard to predict just how civilised it’ll remain after launch, but the safety rating should hopefully keep dirty racers away from clean ones. I also don’t think I’ve been on the receiving end of enough bad collisions to gauge just how effective the improved penalties are in actually disciplining the right players effectively, but I’ve had mostly great, clean races so far. Perhaps my favourite new touch from the multiplayer, though? The ability to skip to the end of a lap in the pre-race sessions (or when attacking times in the asynchronous Rivals mode). Messed up a corner? The Skip Lap option will respawn you on a flyer, just a few corners from the start line. It’s such a clever time saver. After six long years, Forza Motorsport is off the lift and back in our lives. It looks great, feels great, sounds great, and it’s brought with it the most impressive multiplayer we’ve seen in the series so far. With 500 cars and 20 track locations it’s hardly a small start but, now positioned as a platform, Forza Motorsport has the potential to expand into a seriously rich racing destination over the coming years. If Flight Simulator on four wheels is the plan, I’m here for it. First on the list of improvements Turn 10 should focus on is revamping the new RPG-inspired upgrade system that turns progression into an unnecessarily long road ahead of each individual car, and maybe bringing back the joys of split-screen multiplayer racing to complement the excellent online modes.

19,High On Life: High on Knife DLC ,6.0,"After nine months filled with dark and serious stories in games ranging from Diablo IV to Lies of P, I was more than a little eager to dive back into the stark contrast of stupidity and smut that is High on Life with the release of its first DLC: High on Knife. But while it certainly delivers the usual silly gags, amusingly gross and annoying characters, and some good laughs, that ride comes to an abrupt stop after only two hours, ending before I’d even fully settled back into a goofy world I’d desperately like to spend some more time in. Beyond that, the focus on Knifey, one of the more one-dimensional friends in your arsenal, doesn’t make for a particularly good story (even if he’s usually a reliable source of chuckles), and a lack of improvements to gunplay or performance are disappointing as well. I’m really glad that developer Squanch Games is making more High on Life adventures, but this brief second course doesn’t have nearly enough meat on the bones to justify dusting off my copy and reinstalling.   As you might expect, High on Knife focuses on the one-dimensional character Knifey: the homicidal, foul-mouthed Australian stabbing implement. He unexpectedly receives contact from the knife homeworld and forces you on a low-stakes quest to reunite him with his people. That brief odyssey takes you to Peroxis – a salt-covered desert planet that’s home to a species of extremely annoying and perpetually ill slugs who can’t seem to figure out what’s causing their health woes. Although there are plenty of enjoyable bits to be found on this barren world, it doesn’t make for the most cohesive story. Plus, hearing Knifey talk about how he wants to stab everyone and everything was a gag that already ran long in the base campaign, so doubling down on it here is a bit uninspired to say the least. Also, without going into spoilers, the whole journey ends in the most abrupt, unsatisfying, and uncharacteristically unfunny way possible. Speaking of which, that ending arrives a whole lot sooner than I expected, which is one of High on Knife’s major (and most literal) shortcomings. I reached the credits in a little over two hours, right as I thought the story was getting started. After arriving on Peroxis, you go on a handful of short quests before fighting one boss, and… that’s it. Don’t get me wrong, you can certainly spend more time than that talking to ridiculous characters, going on a handful of minor sidequests, and hunting for collectibles, but with just one new area to explore and very little story to keep me invested, there was precious little for me to be excited about. After looking under every rock I was able to find just five hours of stuff to do; Just when I was finally feeling comfortable back in this universe and with all the controls and combat mechanics after so long away from it, it was done. At least the credits, where Knifey just ruthlessly roasts the entire development team, are entertaining to watch. High on Life is an irreverent, absurd shooter that manages to shine with its outrageous humor, silly setting and story, and some really goofy, foul-mouthed guns that pull the whole thing together for the vast majority of the time. Combat is a bit sloppy, especially during the first act, and the whole sci-fi adventure sometimes has an unpolished feel to it, but once you get some new tools of destruction and movement options, it rises to the occasion. Not all of its jokes find their punchline, but with memorable boss fights, unique alt-fire abilities and exploration, and way more terrible movies to watch than I expected, this wacky journey is definitely worth your time. The good news is that, although it’s far too thin, the stuff you’re doing is mostly the same ridiculous and amusing shenanigans for which this over-the-top universe is known. You’ll get coughed on by sick slugs, help a giant naked alien remove parasites from his butt, and invade a sort of space Amazon warehouse with even more questionable business practices than the earthly equivalent. There are some real highlights too, like one part where you can choose to partake in a parody episode of Cheers, complete with a probably illegal use of Frasier Crane for no reason at all. Some of the side quests are worthwhile too, like one where you have to collect gross Pokemon-like trading cards, then duel a nerd with them. When these moments hit, they reminded me why I enjoyed this dumb universe so much – it’s just so incredibly brief there’s not a whole lot to savor. The best part of High on Life has always been the guns, called Gatlians, who serve as your trustworthy companions, and that’s certainly still true. The additional dialogue and time spent with Gus, my beloved frog-like shotgun, and Creature, the socially awkward weirdo, were very much welcome, and make the sometimes lackluster shooting easier to look past. Unfortunately, the new guns aren’t all that interesting. For example, Harper, an ex-military gun with a dark past who replaces Kenny as the standard pistol, is a poor replacement – or at the very least, she wasn’t given enough time in the limited spotlight to really shine. Even worse, the biggest addition, called B.A.L.L., doesn’t do as much for me as a character – it’s a gun operated by a Blue Man Group-adjacent trio of three miniature aliens whose gibberish language can’t add anything to the conversation at all. Unlike every other weapon, it’s more fun to shoot than it is to listen to. Thankfully, the new weapons and abilities are definitely some of the highlights. B.A.L.L. turns the battlefield into a game of pinball, with a metal ball bouncing back and forth until it explodes for serious damage. You’re even able to deploy bumpers by using the weapon’s trick hole ability, which lets you automate and speed up the bouncing. Knifey also gains a new chainsaw ability in the second hour, which allows him to tear through environmental obstructions, carve his way through certain surfaces, and pull some sweet slide moves. Unfortunately, it ends so soon after you get that ability that there’s precious little room to actually play with it. High on Knife is a decent add-on for those searching for an excuse to jump back into Squanch Games’ gross world of naughty words and cartoon violence, but it doesn’t offer a whole lot of reasons to stick around for more than a couple of hours. With a disappointingly short questline and an ill-advised focus on some of the weaker members of the High on Life cast, it doesn’t come close to reaching the same highs (pun intended) as it did last year. There are certainly some decent laughs to be had, and more of this shamelessly idiotic world is by no means a bad thing, but there just isn’t enough here for me to be able to enthusiastically recommend anyone clear even this small amount of time on their busy gaming schedule. "
20,Cocoon ,9.0,"Without a single word, Cocoon takes a small, cicada-like creature on an exciting journey through the cosmos using only a thumbstick and a single button. That setup should sound exceedingly familiar for fans of gameplay designer Jeppe Carlsen's previous work, Limbo and Inside. But here, Cocoon differentiates itself from those monumentally creepy side-scrolling adventures as a 3D puzzle-platformer, and the additional dimension provides a refreshing amount of, well, depth to its challenging and intriguing puzzles. These puzzles build on each other in smart ways, keeping fundamental mechanics from the desert at the very start integrated and important all the way to the end. And even as Cocoon gets more and more complex, its minimalist controls make sure it never feels overwhelming.   It’s not long before your cicada is unexpectedly whisked out of that barren starting area and into a harsh mechanical one, and it’s there you find your first orb – a mysterious orange sphere that somehow contains that entire previous desert world inside of it. You can pick this world up and carry it around, using it to power platforms, lifts, and other machines that impede your progress. Solving these puzzles as you swap between worlds is a wonderful time; seeing how each piece of the puzzle interacts with others and figuring out the layers between them is some of the most mesmerizing and engaging stuff I've seen in a while. And it’s dazzlingly beautiful. While Limbo and Inside both stuck with a simpler, more monochromatic tone, Cocoon breaks out of that mold with vibrant, curated color palettes. Each world has its own distinct color and vibe, from the warm sands of its first orange orb-world to the squishy and alien textures of the purple one later on.  As you progress through the relatively short five or six-hour story, the orb-worlds unveil special powers; revealing hidden paths, changing the state of objects between gaseous and solid, and other abilities that provide solutions to puzzles that were impossible before. It’s almost Metroidvania-like that way. Eventually, our little cicada friend is juggling and hopping between several of these different uniquely designed orb-worlds, with the only connection between them being the strange alien technology powering everything. Keeping track of each world's position and seeing how many layers deep you can place them almost feels like a dream; trying to remember where you placed the orange orb that's holding the white and green orbs while you're in the purple one can be a strange, almost mystifying experience sometimes. Each orb ends with a boss fight that's as unique as the world that contains it, providing a new final puzzle and challenge for step of the way. Every boss has a specific mechanic that's used to take them down, like a weakness to the explosives that grow nearby or trapping their legs in an amber-like substance. With only one button, the team at Geometric went above and beyond in designing some intense, engaging combat scenarios without sacrificing Cocoon's adventurous, curious feel. Puzzling out the patterns of the bosses takes the interactions you've learned with different objects and turns them upside down – carrying a ball and timing out when to cross a platform becomes holding an explosive flower and dodging the crystal structures one boss leaves in its path in an almost rhythm game-like fashion. Don't let those combat sections fool you, though; Cocoon is a puzzler through and through. With the orbs being both the worlds the levels are contained in and batteries for the technology within them, this is a game that’s ready to bend reality and challenge you in the best of ways. These puzzles are no joke, especially if you find yourself stuck – with little but trial and error, some of them can feel like you're retracing your steps over and over again as you try and swap between orbs one at a time. Eventually, though, the hints contained in the level design become clearer; a color-coded pathway will appear, or the rock formations in the distance will be covered in moss to give you a clue about which orb to use. But it’s not obvious, to the point where there were a couple times where I was convinced that I had somehow broken a puzzle by placing some objects in the wrong spot and sealing certain pathways off by doing so. Every time, though, I was able to find my way through before my patience ran out; sometimes, the spots where I felt way off course even ended up being vital solutions to the puzzle! A subtle bit of encouragement comes in the form of musical cues and triumphant swells that occur as you get closer and closer to the solution, cheering you on the whole time and adding to the feeling of discovery and accomplishment you feel once you finally crack the puzzle. Right before the repetition and feeling of walking the same paths back and forth starts to wear thin, Cocoon loops around from the verge of frustration to an almost Zen-like experience. You’re introduced to new and exciting concepts that eventually become natural and easy; what was once an entire solution is now barely even a piece of a much larger puzzle. The absence of any overt guidance as I made my way through this wordless story made it feel like the cicada is being compelled by some force, natural or otherwise, to complete its task.  All of this is this little guy’s role in the universe – even if we don't know exactly what we're doing, we're helping him push forward and discovering the larger meaning of these puzzles as we do. As things click together, it starts feeling like the times I figured out why an old boss of mine would have me do a bunch of seemingly pointless, disconnected tasks, only to find out later that each of those tasks was part of a project so large I couldn’t see the shape of it at the time. It's a strange feeling, but rewarding nonetheless. Later puzzles add layers to the complexity and the need to basically open your third eye to solve them. It’s not unlike the feeling of getting the hang of Portal, where suddenly there’s an entirely new way of thinking about what’s possible in a space. Once you start bouncing between each world, bringing one orb into another and using its abilities to trigger something you couldn't before, everything really starts to click; the depth of what's going on here is easy to miss, thanks to the simplified control scheme and deceptively uncomplicated art style, but the way you can seamlessly hop in and out of different worlds – and even place a world within a world in order to solve certain puzzles – is really something to behold.  Despite that layered and compounding challenge, Cocoon doesn't last very long at all – my first playthrough took a crisp five and a half hours, though it also contains plenty of replay value in finding the hidden Moon Ancestor collectibles tucked away in each world. Each of these collectibles are incredibly well hidden, but the feeling of intrigue I got while finding them (and the achievements you get for them) compelled me to find more whenever I could. Even though I wasn't able to find them all, the feeling of the few that I did find blew me away; I'll definitely be coming back to find the rest. Cocoon is a breathtaking puzzle-platformer that borders on psychedelic. Building on what made Inside designer Jeppe Carlsen's previous work stand out, Cocoon not only presents a mind-bending journey through the cosmos via fascinating worlds-within-worlds puzzle mechanics that beg you to delve another layer deeper, but an interesting take on the repetition of work, life, and being part of a ""bigger picture."" With a relatively short playtime and some well-hidden collectibles that make it worth replaying, Cocoon is a must-play for fans of Limbo or Inside, or anyone looking for a new puzzle adventure to play and then sit down and think about for a while.

21,EA Sports FC 24 ,7.0,"What’s in a name? When EA announced it would change the title of its premiere soccer series from FIFA to EA Sports FC24, we all wondered: is this also the year it finally takes a real step forward, out of the microtransaction-focused darkness and into the light of its full potential? Well, the answer is a resounding… kind of. There are breadcrumbs of greatness in EA Sports FC 24, with many new mechanics like Evolutions and Tactical Visions showing the series can evolve into something better. Yet, for every exciting improvement added in, there's still far too many of the same things, like poor AI, that have frustrated me for years.   For the first few hours of EA Sports FC 24, everything feels familiar gameplay-wise, for better and for worse. HyperMotion V and the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller feedback return make matches realistic, with precise ball and player physics, noticeable field wear and tear, and goal post-shaking haptics. It's hard to deny that there's a lot of attention to detail going into recreating a realistic soccer atmosphere. New overlays showcase useful statistics like shot volume and player fatigue mid-game, with numerous background interview segments laced throughout matchday's pre, mid, and post-game segments as well. While they don’t feature any actual interactions with players and interviewers, it’s one of the many noticeable bits of detail that add to the atmosphere. If you foul someone to set up a free kick, you’ll even get a neat little first-person setup from the ref’s perspective, just like you’d see during a live broadcast. At the same time, team walkouts and ceremonial songs have sadly been cut, replaced by a few different shots of either fans or players getting ready for game day. It's a shame that I can take a League Two side like Wrexham all the way to the Premier League and still not get to hear their glorious anthem or see them walk out during their debut on the grandest stage of them all. Unfortunately, the artificial intelligence part of the Hypermotion V technology that has been so heavily advertised doesn't live up to the hype. While Kinetic Shielding makes for some exciting battles, players still fall all over each other in unnatural ways. Advanced machine learning, which is pretty much a fancy way of saying constantly improving AI, is also hit-or-miss. Your goalkeepers will sometimes stand sideways and let an easy shot in or punch a ball that could have been caught, AI teammates make terrible attacking or defensive decisions that would have Harry Maguire blushing, and you'll likely find yourself yelling about an incorrect passing input more than once a match despite knowing you angled a perfect through ball with your sticks. It’s frustrating that these issues are still a part of the series, but there are changes that help ease the pain of dealing with them, most notably Playstyles. As the name suggests, Playstyles customize every player's method of play to fit their specific strengths and weaknesses. As a result, no two players control the same way, adding a fresh layer to gameplay and how you approach team management. It’s genuinely impressive how EA has managed to capture each player’s likeness, as you can bully opponents off the ball and rip through nets with Erling Haaland's Power Shot or finesse passes and set pieces with James Ward-Prowse’s Dead Ball approach. When creating your own customized player's Playstyle, you'll sift through 32 abilities spread across six categories: Shooting, Passing, Defending, Ball Control, Physical, and Goalkeeping. While it might seem simple at first, each one has a lot of unique sub-abilities to sort through that determine your character’s build, making a world of difference when it comes to tailoring your preset skills to work alongside your specific manner of play. Since I always create a Forward player that dominates the middle of the pitch, getting the Tiki Taka attribute makes controlling the middle of the pitch with quick passes to teammates a breeze, especially when coupled with First Touch, which makes getting and controlling the ball for the first time while under pressure more possible. With the ability to control the ball perfectly, my character can open up the field with wide through balls that get played right back into him or teammates to create a lot of chances on goal. FIFA 23 is a bombastic swan song for the series (under its current name, at least) with a welcome focus on theatrical flair. FUT Moments, action replays and viral-friendly gameplay revisions like Power Shots make it a more considered, memorable game of simulated football with intentional defending and plenty of drama and goals. But EA's Spartan approach to the modes that don't make money ensures FIFA 23 is an all-too-familiar beast to previous years, and Ultimate Team’s offensive focus on microtransactions continues to take much of the fun out of it. Alongside Playstyles, you can now go into the settings and turn on an option to control the direction of your passes and shots, replacing the previous Precision system. Shots are more on target while using the left stick to aim and general passes and lobs can be directed to exact locations. Mastering these techniques won't come without a bit of practice, but they open up the possibility of making creative runs, especially when working with other players.  Thankfully, the updated practice arena has more depth in EA Sports FC24 than it ever did in FIFA, adding in Scenarios that new players and veterans alike would be wise to check out. You can try out specific set pieces here, or nail down what Playstyle works best for you in drills or even full-on matches. Putting your pride aside and playing here to get the hang of the controlled shots and passes is worth it in the long run, as you can run experiments in a much quicker and more efficient manner than you’d be able to by playing full games thanks to the sheer amount of control you’re given. Once you've got your style nailed down, it's time to dive into the real reason EA Sports FC 24 is as popular as it is: its trading-card game mode, aka Sports Yu-Gi-Oh, aka FUT, aka Ultimate Team. As always, you'll need to go into Ultimate Team knowing full well that it always feels inherently unfair because people who are willing to spend real money on microtransactions to get packs will have a much better squad in a shorter amount of time than someone who doesn’t. The name of the game is still that quantity results in quality, and microtransactions pay for quantity. While it’s aggravating that grinding or paying the big bucks are still your only two options for significant progress, improvements elsewhere help deliver one of the best Ultimate Team experiences to date, even if you don’t pay. Evolutions in Ultimate Team allow you to take the base stats of cards and improve them by completing challenges, as long as they fit the criteria, which vary from stats like Overall, Pace, and Rarity. Manchester United lovers no longer have to wait to see Alexander Garnacho's potential fulfilled, taking him from a Left Wing 75 rating to a Relentless Winger 82 rating thanks to the Founders Evolution. To do this, you’ll simply complete objectives that are broken down into levels. Finish a group of requirements in a level, and you’ll get a stat boost reward. What’s nice is that completing these objectives isn’t as brutal as previous games in the series (yes, I’m talking about you, FUT 20), as most just ask you to complete matches with your EVO player. Getting to improve players you draw instead of just praying for a good pull is an enticing  incentive to play Ultimate Team for the long term.  Another leap forward for this mode is the addition of over 19,000 fully licensed players, 700 teams, and 30 leagues from the women’s soccer divisions to Ultimate Team; FIFA 23 only had 12 NWSL teams and four stadiums by comparison. EA Sports FC24 not only lets you play as everyone from Sam Keer to Kadidiatou Diani, but it makes men's and women's statistics equal. That means Nadine Kessler is able to body players off the ball the exact same way that Adama Traore can, making for some wild mixed-gender matchups and lineups. The other, often overlooked stepchild multiplayer mode in EA Sports FC 24, Volta, didn't change up too much, but it's the one I had the most fun with. Sure, there will be matches where someone is idle or is a complete ball hog, but the ones where you link up with compatible players bring back fond memories of FIFA Street. Few things are more satisfying than wall bouncing to a teammate who dekes around the keeper after a great build-up that leads to scoring multiple points. Since chemistry is so important, it’s recommended that you try and round up a solid squad of four friends if you want to get the most enjoyment and best results out of Volta. Stadium variety also adds quite a bit of variety to matches, with some featuring larger goals and others having higher walls to bounce the ball off. It’s a welcome bit of diversity to help prevent each game from feeling too repetitive. By comparison, the single-player focused Career Modes are a considerable letdown. Player journeys are once again riddled with a poor excuse for role-playing, with FIFA 23's Personality Points rearing their ugly head again. Honestly, I can't imagine anything screaming 'I love soccer' more than purchasing a Jetski to earn 50 “Maverick” points that will result in my player being a more aggressive shooter. The addition of Player Agents and Dynamic Moments show some potential to help flesh out the mode and make it a more fun RPG, but even those fail to stick the landing. While the idea of meeting certain goals via a Player Agent to get a transfer or renewed contract from your dream squad sounds nice in theory, some of the objectives are insane. You can have a Ballon d'Or, 60-plus goal season, and still be released from contract because you didn't hit five bicycle kicks in any of them. Yeah, sorry, Messi – we know you broke the record for most goals scored in a campaign, but we had to let you go because you didn't get enough Scorpion Kick goals as you were doing it. What? The whole thing sours what could have been a really great way to make up for the lack of being able to choose your own path and direction that has weighed down previous Career Modes. Dynamic moments also fail to capture the weight and gravity of situations fully, as you can only watch the same cutscene so many times before wondering where the story-based content of FIFA 17's Alex Hunter has gone.  Manager Mode is a little more interesting in EA Sports FC 24, mostly due to the seven tactical identities that your coach can apply to their club. Tactical Vision is what Playstyles are for an individual, just applied to a whole team instead. Pick the more defensive-minded Park the Bus option for a great defense, or use Tiki-Taka to control the middle of the field. I always prefer Wing Play, as nothing beats charging down the field and crossing it into an open net. Even then, there isn’t much that has changed in this Career Mode either, as single-player once again feels like an afterthought, cowering in the long shadow cast by Ultimate Teams. If you were hoping for a dramatic reinvention of EA’s soccer sim to go along with ditching the FIFA name, EA Sports FC 24 is not that. If you’ve played FIFA, you know exactly what kind of incremental improvements and longstanding problems with AI to expect this year. New mechanics like Evolutions show that EA has a general grasp of how to improve its RPG elements, even if it’s only currently for Ultimate Team where you have to put up with all of the dreaded microtransactions. Elsewhere, Volta mode is still a lot of fun with a full team of friends thanks in part to its unique arenas, while the Career Modes once again suffer from the same lack of care they’ve been missing for years, with the added annoyance of some ill-conceived RNG-based objectives this time. All told, it might have a new name, but EA Sports FC 24 is just about the same, frustrating but beautiful game. "
22,Super Bomberman R 2 ,7.0,"When it comes to arcade classics like Bomberman, the secret to longevity is keeping it simple. Though there have been dozens of iterations of Hudson Soft's absorbing competitive puzzler, they've all largely adhered to the same principle: blowing things (and people) up in a candy-colored paradise. Just about every one of them has a new gimmick waiting around the corner, whether it’s the spacious areas of action-flavored Bomberman Generation or Bomberman Tournament's Zelda-like Quest Mode. That's how Super Bomberman R 2 manages to keep the hits coming: with some clever modes that put a new spin on things. Of course, Bomberman has always been at its best when played with others, so it's no surprise that's where this feature-rich sequel shines in contrast to its repetitive single-player story mode and largely empty open world.   True to the format of the top-down, 2D original, the fun of Super Bomberman R 2’s multiplayer modes comes from throwing down explosives to blow up destructible obstacles while avoiding your own blasts and those of everybody else. When you aren't narrowly escaping an enemy's explosion, you're looking for ways to trick or trap them into walking into yours. As a result, you’re always forced to go on the offensive, constantly calculating where your next bomb is going to go, all the while keeping an eye on enemies who are doing the same. There are tons of ways to play with friends via local or online multiplayer, including the 64-player Battle 64 mode that has you fighting through a knock-down, drag-out battle royale. (Fortunately there’s crossplay, so there’s no trouble filling games.) It doesn’t jam 64 people on one map – that would be chaos – but rather takes a smarter, more manageable, tournament-style approach. You start out in a traditional four-player Bomberman match, while the other 56 combatants duke it out elsewhere in 16 other rooms simultaneously, much like the Switch’s now-defunct Super Mario 35. A timer counts down from 60 seconds, and when it hits zero, play areas are removed one by one. That leaves the last few players scrambling to survive, with one player being crowned victor. You can travel through the other boards during the Movement Phase to stay away from elimination zones, so it's smart to keep track of where everyone else is, too. It's humbling to finish dead last your first few rounds, but like any good battle royale, the drive to improve kept me coming back over and over again. Also new is Castle, an exciting and surprisingly strategic asymmetrical multiplayer mode that designates one Bomberman character as ""king"" and pits them against 15 other players. On the castle side, the king defends a number of treasure chests scattered throughout the stage by editing the map to their liking and setting traps and obstacles, and it’s fun to watch the attacking side try to get through it all. For example, gimmicks include parts like the Conveyor Belt, which can move players and bombs alike, and are meant to be part of enemy-stalling strategies. Weapons are simple but effective, with options like cannons that shoot bombs that can fly over walls, blades that you can plant to slash enemies in close proximity, lasers for long-range targets, and more. It may seem like a one-sided fight, but even when I was playing as one of the 15 attackers it can be difficult to suss out and capture all the treasure chests when you’re playing against a smart king. These matches are just as tense and unpredictable as Battle 64.  Another mode, Grand Prix, returns from Super Bomberman R: you and other players are divided into two teams to compete in four types of minigames. While they aren't drastically different from one another, each serves up a unique challenge that adapts familiar multiplayer rules like Capture the Flag. For instance, one mode has you competing to steal five ""Balloms"" from the other team to bring them back to your base. Crystals is just a race to see which team can collect the most crystals in a certain amount of time. If you don't feel like a lengthy Castle battle or want to spice things up beyond regular Bomberman matches, these quick Grand Prix rounds are a good alternative. On top of that there's a robust level editor (similar to what's available to the king in Castle mode) that you can use to make your own traditional Bomberman stages. Conceptually, it has a lot in common with Super Mario Maker, including the ability to share and download levels with others online by way of nine-digit level codes. Alternatively, you can browse what’s available until you see a level you like. In practice, unfortunately, the controls are cumbersome, making painstakingly placing each map detail block after block feel like a chore. For those who do decide to invest in some serious building time, there are absolutely brutal maps that can be crafted, as evidenced by my sifting through the maps already online and finding some real challenges. As with most online games these days, there’s a whole progression system to advance through, and moving up the ranks means earning currency to unlock fun character skins, player quotes, and more. Importantly, you’re racking up currency whether you’re playing online or offline modes, win or lose, and there are no real-money microtransactions at all – but it’d take a long, long time to earn everything. Super Bomberman R’s multiplayer versatility and boss-filled story mode are laudable retreads of classic gameplay, but its depth and customizability are disappointing. By contrast, the aforementioned Bomberman Live was a brilliant, fully featured Bomberman for Xbox 360 that came out 10 years ago, and it only cost $10. It’s reasonable to expect a bit more from a $50 Bomberman game in 2017. There's a dizzying amount of customization options to choose from, including costumes from Konami games like Metal Gear, Castlevania, and even Silent Hill. Yes, you can have an adorable Pyramid Head to run around as. There are even a few references to classic Japanese dating sim Tokimeki Memorial, with an entire Shiori Fujisaki skin available. Since many of the costumes are more like brand new characters with their own abilities, movement speeds, and different bomb damage zones, it's worth racking up hours to earn your favorites. Others, like accessories and quotes as well as player badges, are just for you to spruce up your profile. Those are the reasons you’d want to play Super Bomberman R 2. The six-hour, four-world story mode, on the other hand, is not one of them. To be fair, it’s a considerable improvement on its predecessor’s campaign, but that isn’t saying much. True, it's twice as long and ditches linear arenas in favor of open-world exploration. However, these open areas are in no way comparable even to Bomberman 64's rudimentary RPG campaign; this one is little more than a tutorial for multiplayer. Bite-sized cutscenes with Bomberman and his rainbow-flavored pals move the largely forgettable plot along, but they at least explain why you're recruiting the cute little Ellons in each world to help solve puzzles and unlock new areas. Unfortunately, there isn’t much to see in each themed world beyond obstacles to destroy, simple puzzles to solve, and Ellons waiting to be rescued. And though cutscenes are heavily stylized with vibrant colors and fun character designs, the disappointingly basic and bland in-game environments and character models don’t follow suit. Luckily, the music is as good as it’s ever been, which at least helps make up for the confoundingly bad voice acting.  The occasional boss encounters break up some of the monotony, but it's back to drudgery after that. If your Bomberman is hit even once, whether by your own blast or an enemy’s, you lose all your collected Ellons following you in your current world. So whether you had two or five, you’ll have to go all the way back to your base to retrieve them. Sometimes it’s a trek to head back to your base after making all that progress. You’ll have to trudge through each monotonous maze once more, because some obstacles require a certain amount of Ellons for you to pass. All this backtracking only adds to the repetition, which means the story will likely wear thin long before you reach the end. Occasionally, you'll also see Castle mode within the story as well, which is an interesting twist. When you first start playing you're required to create your own stage with the level editor to be used as your HQ. Bots will take the role of human players, and if they steal all your treasure, you'll end up losing a life. So at least you’ll quickly get a lot of practice for multiplayer by completing the story. Super Bomberman R 2's extensive set of classically entertaining multiplayer modes, powerful but frustrating level editor, and fun customization options give you more than enough to do to make up for the dull story mode. Though it doesn't completely atone for its predecessor's throwaway plot, simplistic character models, and lack of content, it changes things up enough to court both new and old fans. With its large-scale Battle 64 battle royale and a new tower defense-inspired Castle mode, it’s worth playing for a few new spins on the age-old idea of blowing your friends up. "
23,Pokemon Scarlet and Violet: The Teal Mask DLC ,5.0,"It’s been almost a year since I reviewed Pokemon Scarlet and Violet at launch, and I still feel more conflicted about them than any other Pokemon game in all my years loving the series. They dazzled me with their open world design, which felt like the answer to years of fan requests – but the performance and aesthetic hits that came with that innovation were painful catches that didn’t quite feel worth the trade. Still, with two DLCs on the horizon, I had hope that Game Freak would be able to pull it together. Could the first DLC, The Teal Mask, fix Scarlet and Violet’s glaring issues and deliver a robust, new experience that fully embraced the clear potential of what these games could have been? Nope!!!  For starters, I don’t know how it’s possible, but somehow The Teal Mask runs worse than the base game of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet does. I complained about the poor performance of Scarlet and Violet in my initial review, and had hoped that a whole year later Game Freak would have made improvements to things like framerate, pop-in, weird lighting issues, model clipping, and everything else – problems Nintendo even stated it was working to address back in December. But it hasn’t. Instead, it feels like the DLC has the jankiness turned up about one or two more notches. It’s still playable: I didn’t run into any game breaking bugs. I did suffer from one hard crash, which while not a huge deal due to the game's frequent autosave, is still pretty shocking given the franchise's relatively polished history. But more importantly, during my playthrough of The Teal Mask it was impossible to go for more than a minute or two without a visual distraction. Maybe my Tinkaton was clipping through the ground during battle, or falling into the abyss when an encounter started on a cliffside. Maybe I was watching nearby Pokemon models vibrate violently, or seeing NPCs vanish in and out of existence. Or maybe the whole thing was just chugging, simply because I was riding on my Miraidon and it didn’t know how to handle more than a few trees appearing on screen at once. Look, I don’t expect high-fidelity graphics at the level of the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X in my Pokemon games. But the sheer amount of issues is so distracting all the time that it became an active detriment to my enjoyment. And if Game Freak keeps up its current pace of making performance several degrees worse with each game, by the next gen or so Pokemon might be literally unplayable, because you won’t be able to see anything. Fingers crossed that The Indigo Disk DLC this Winter improves matters literally at all. I’ve been tearing my hair out for two weeks now over how conflicted I feel about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. The thing is, discovering and catching all these charming monsters across an enormous open world with an actually good story is really fun… it just comes with far, far too many asterisks. I truly believe that the bold new ideas of Scarlet and Violet are fantastic, if unrefined – a belief I also held about Pokémon Legends: Arceus. But in both cases, so many of the pillars holding up those shining concepts – visual quality, open-world details, customization, and technical soundness – are seemingly unfinished or actively crumbling. It is completely impossible to play Scarlet and Violet and not notice at least some of its performance issues. Every minute I was happily running around the grassy fields of Paldea I was also actively cringing at a Pokémon stuck in the floor, wincing at some weird framerate nonsense going on with a nearby wild Pokémon, or groaning at another bout of crippling lag. And the promising online co-op play that could be the start of an exciting new era for the series makes all these problems significantly worse. As a decades-long fan, I desperately want better for Pokémon, especially given how clear it is that the design fundamentals are absolutely there under the surface. But if you’re devoted to this series, as so many are, know that the proper care we’ve all come to expect has not been shown here. I don’t want to keep harping on the performance issues, but one more critical note on this point is that my problems with endgame raid battles from the original review still haven’t been fixed, which tangibly impacts gameplay. Queuing into online raids is still inconsistent due to the very weird way in which Scarlet and Violet refreshes its available raids and doesn’t notify you when they’re full. And once you do get in, completing high-level raids can be challenging due to lag and a weird timer system sometimes skipping your turn, freezing your screen, or otherwise making it impossible to tell what’s going on at any given moment. While some major raiding bugs have been fixed in the last year, it was impossible for me to spend time on the primary endgame content of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet or its DLC without running into this stuff and being frustrated by it. My feelings about the new Kitakami island region itself aren’t much fonder. Like Paldea, the world of Scarlet and Violet’s DLC is butt-ugly, with low-res textures, little detail in its environments, and a single town mostly made up of buildings you can’t enter and NPCs uttering boring, nothing phrases. That big local “festival” that the trailers hyped up? It’s just a few carts with vendors and some uninteresting NPCs. It’s even more of a disappointment when you consider that Kitakami is based on Japan – a nation that Game Freak has based multiple memorable regions off of before (Kanto and Johto). When I’ve already seen a Japanese-inspired world done in such loving detail in multiple Pokemon Games, Kitakami feels like a massive letdown.  That said, The Teal Mask isn’t all bad. The battling and competitive aspects are still what they’ve always been (good), and it’s still fun to fill up a PC box full of neat little dudes you find running around outside. The island checks all the boxes for that activity specifically: it’s big, full of Pokemon, and has lots of different biomes to poke around in. One of my favorite parts of Kitakami was the mountain at its center with crystalline pools at the summit, numerous caves along its path to the top, and a surprising cavern structure within full of Pokemon hiding around corners and in little holes. But the overall ugliness and performance issues did detract from locations that looked like they were probably quite beautiful in their concept art, just not their final execution – such as when I first laid eyes on those sparkling pools on the mountaintop, or when I crossed a thin, stone bridge to a mysterious cave as the sunset hit the surrounding rock formations. Content-wise, The Teal Mask largely consists of a familiar Pokemon formula where you track down a legendary Pokemon while learning about local lore. You’re accompanied on this quest by a sibling pair, Carmine and Kieran, both of whom spent most of the story alternating between yelling at me over nothing and challenging me to battles. The Teal Mask’s plot is so overdone that even a Slowpoke could see its twists coming, which is a pretty big bummer after the heights reached during the ending of Scarlet and Violet. This DLC campaign is also short, about seven or eight hours long, though catching every newly-added monster will stretch it a bit more. The best part of Teal Mask’s story is the subplot surrounding a photographer, Perrin, who sends you on a Pokemon Snap-esque photography journey after a totally different legendary Pokemon. After hours of Carmine and Kieran shouting at me, Perrin’s curiosity and backstory with photography were a refreshing change, and her photo-taking minigame provided a natural avenue for The Teal Mask to expand on something I loved in Scarlet and Violet: discovering Pokemon doing fun Pokemon things in their habitats. Frankly, Perrin’s story is so much more interesting than the rest of the DLC that it’s a shame I couldn’t spend more time hanging out with her and her Hisuian Growlithe instead of being dragged around by the world’s most unnecessarily angsty preteens. Other new features in The Teal Mask include an expanded Pokedex with a tiny handful of new monsters, a middling selection of new cosmetic choices, and a terrible minigame called “Ogre Oustin’” that involves tanking your framerate further by speeding around on your bike to collect berries really fast. While I’m always happy to praise Game Freak’s Pokemon designs (especially the candy apple-themed Dipplin – cute!), and it’s nice to finally change out of my hideous school uniform, I don’t know what they were thinking with Ogre Oustin’. It’s boring, repetitive, runs terribly (especially online), and yet made me feel bad about not wanting to play it by offering great rewards for anyone looking to build raiding or competitive teams. Terrible. The ways in which The Teal Mask feels like a step backward from what made Scarlet and Violet astonishing are also disappointing. Scarlet and Violet themselves promoted player freedom: you could go anywhere you wanted at almost any time, and do the major plot points in any order. The Teal Mask mysteriously tosses that in the bin in favor of a far more standard, linear journey. While you can explore any part of the island at any time, there’s no benefit to doing so beyond catching Pokemon. You can’t even do the initial quest – which involves visiting three sign boards around the island – in any order. The sudden loss of that player freedom is painful given how critical it was to my enjoyment of the base game. It’s also a surprisingly weak effort when compared to Game Freak’s previous DLC attempts in Pokemon Sword and Shield’s Isle of Armor and Crown Tundra. While both of these DLC were similarly criticized for being shallow in the story department, Isle of Armor added challenge by forcing you to train a brand new Pokemon, while Crown Tundra included multiple new game modes. The Teal Mask does… none of that, and feels distinctly incomplete. Maybe that’s because it was always meant to be just one half of a package with The Indigo Mask, but if that’s the case, then I question the wisdom of splitting the DLC at all. I just don’t know what to say anymore! I love Pokemon. I love catching monsters, and exploring, and filling a Pokedex, and harnessing the power of love, friendship, and adventure and all that. But The Teal Mask is yet another step in a slow quality downslide for this series: it runs terribly, looks ugly, feels predictable, doesn’t offer any of the freedom Scarlet and Violet’s main story did, and falls short in so many ways compared to just about every other Pokemon game and DLC I’ve played. If you’re considering The Teal Mask because you thought Scarlet and Violet were fun and just want more Pokemon, sure, this DLC will give you that. But as someone who was hoping The Teal Mask and a year of polish would turn things around for the ninth generation of Pokemon, I am sorely disappointed. "
24,Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty ,9.0,"Remember how many dildos were originally in Cyberpunk 2077? You couldn’t loot a corner in Night City without picking one up, to the point where CD Projekt Red actually had to patch a number of them out. Lootable dildos weren’t necessarily a problem on their own, but their abundance was a good example of how Cyberpunk’s grand story could occasionally clash with the cheap shock humor found around it. Phantom Liberty aims to right that dildo misalignment, and after some soul-searching, has seemingly found what kind of Cyberpunk story it wants to tell, and nails it. Balancing the punk-rock verve of Mike Pondsmith’s tabletop RPG with an exquisitely crafted spy story and best-in-class visuals, Phantom Liberty is Cyberpunk 2077 at its best. A quick detour: the backstories of Dogtown, Night City, and the whole Cyberpunk tabletop universe are heavily referenced in Phantom Liberty, to the point I had to look up lore guides to figure out exactly what was happening. It’s not so complicated that it’s impenetrable for the uninitiated, though, and CDPR does a good job of laying out the stakes clearly. But I imagine this stuff will appeal directly to fans of the tabletop game than inspired Cyberpunk 2077.  Phantom Liberty begins with the President of the NUS crash landing in a self-governed district of Night City called Dogtown, and you’re hired by her Secret Service detail to rescue her. From there you will meet the two most important new characters in the expansion, Song So-Mi, an NUSA hacker excellently played by Christine Minji Chang, and Solomon Reed, a sleeper agent who is brought back into commission portrayed by the iconic Idris Elba. Elba is again channeling his city-wise American accent from The Wire, only this time on the other side of the law. He’s definitely not phoning this role in either, delivering a thoroughly captivating performance as a secret agent who made me so desperately want to trust him even though he is Night City’s greatest spy, and therefore probably never telling the full truth. Phantom Liberty relies heavily on make-or-break decisions that can’t be taken back, and Reed is part of the reason why those choices become so difficult. Keanu Reeves also makes a return as Johnny Silverhand. Maybe it’s the years since I last played, but I feel Reeves is actually better this time around, performance-wise. Honestly, I think it’s that he has better material to work with in Phantom Liberty, which requires him to rattle off fewer diatribes about screwing over the system. Instead, the expanded story lets Reeves explore Silverhand’s mournful side, delving into his existence as a failed revolutionary imprisoned in someone else’s body. But more than that, between Elba, Reeves, and Chang, Phantom Liberty does a great job highlighting just how advanced its character animations are compared to some other big-budget RPGs. At the intersection of performance and technology, CDPR has found something in Cyberpunk 2077 that can genuinely move you. Just wait until you meet Reed’s spy associate, Alex. Overall, Phantom Liberty has a much firmer grasp on what kinds of stories can be told in Night City. It’s a metropolis full of political wheelings and dealings, all manner of crime, and more than its fair share of idiots, and that’s unique in the sci-fi hacker genre compared to the dour and operatic worlds of Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell. Cyberpunk 2077 is grunge and metal, and Phantom Liberty harnesses this wild energy into mature storytelling – something the outstanding animated Netflix show, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, also managed to capture. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners doesn’t overtake Cyberpunk 2077 so much as it expands upon it. But for the best version of Night City this side of the 21st century, consider diving into Studio Trigger’s madcap vision of the famous tabletop RPG. It’s a wild ride, but worth every blistering second, choom. Elevated by Elba’s and Chang’s respective performances, Phantom Liberty hits all the things I love in a Cyberpunk story: it hones in on the hopelessness of hyper-capitalism and the dehumanizing effects of technology on our souls, all while using the spy motif to introduce some new themes to the world. How can we trust anyone when every element of the future has been so thoroughly taken over by automated forces of corporations and government? It has more to say than I expected going in, and more than I could have hoped for after my initial playthrough of Cyberpunk 2077. Similarly, CDPR gets a ton of mileage out of its spy premise. There are exciting moments where you’re channeling your best Ethan Hunt from Mission: Impossible, complete with a new face to trick your targets, as well as an entire section that was very clearly inspired by Skyfall. I was curious to learn how an espionage plot could fit into Cyberpunk 2077’s story about varying levels of criminality – from the dingiest streets to the tallest executive corporate suite – but Phantom Liberty reminds us that the government, too, is part of our hyper-capitalist meat grinder, and not much separates a government agent from a streetwise fixer. It’s serious business, but whenever the storyline begins to feel too heavy you can take on side jobs for Mr. Hands, a fixer whose clientele ranges from kidnapped arms dealers to a doting resident who just wants to rescue her dumb-as-bricks fiance and his even dumber friend. But make no mistake: CDPR has played a wicked trick by infusing these side missions with the same kind of complex moral dilemmas you’re forced to resolve during the main campaign. What remains just as impressive as it was the first time I played Cyberpunk 2077 is Night City, which is still one of gaming’s great locations. The sense of awe at its scale hasn’t faded, and returning there after three years I find myself with the same level of admiration for CDPR’s grand work. Maybe even more so, given that Phantom Liberty adds an entire new district to the already-packed city. Sure, the idea of an independent Dogtown is a bit confusing if you’re not familiar with the lore, but this lawless Thunderdome proves to be a great setting for Phantom Liberty’s paranoid spy-thriller. This new area draws visual inspiration from both Las Vegas and Santa Monica: it’s part beach town, part luxury resort destination, with extravagant hotels, glamorous night clubs, and a football stadium that’s been converted into a city center. The line that “the location is also a character” has never been truer than it is here. There’s so much fun in wandering around Dogtown and discovering some hidden storyline or bit of environmental storytelling. It’s almost an anti-Tears of the Kingdom, where the joy isn’t in emergent bits of gameplay but in archaeologically uncovering secrets hidden throughout the area. There was always something magical about exploring Night City’s skyline, and doing it again knowing that no other game since has replicated this feat is just as impressive. This is one game I never want to fast-travel through. Without spoilers, there’s a specific point in the expansion’s story where it will diverge based on your decisions, leading you down one of two very distinct paths and endings. I played both for this review and found that one certainly feels more “canon” than the other. There’s also an entirely new ending that’s been added to the base game that feels like it might be the de facto true ending, and takes Phantom Liberty’s themes of self-sacrifice and near-future alienation and uses them to wrap up V and Silverhand’s story. I may start an entire new save to experience this story fully, from beginning to end. With all of the impressive changes in Cyberpunk 2077’s free 2.0 update that arrived alongside this DLC’s launch, starting fresh is actually something I’m looking forward to. On that note, while Phantom Liberty isn’t required to install the 2.0 update, it’s hard to say that the revamped gameplay didn’t positively influence my experience as I played through 20 hours of Phantom Liberty. In particular, the newly reworked skill tree that makes it easier to build your character towards specific playstyles was a revelation. I had always wanted to play my character as a hacking netrunner, but in the 1.0 release in 2020, hacking was a pretty limp tool that let me do little more than distract enemies while waiting for a chance to shoot at them. With 2.0’s revamped cyberware system, I’m able to not only equip more cyberware at once, but the new skill tree makes it easier to enhance both my cybernetic and hacking abilities. I’m finally able to create a true netrunner character, someone capable of getting a group of enemies to point guns at each other if I want them to. Whether you’re pursuing a hacker build, augment-build, or something else, this alone makes Cyberpunk 2077 a much better experience than it was in 2020. To be clear, these are improvements that all Cyberpunk 2077 owners can experience even without buying Phantom Liberty. The expansion doesn’t include much in the way of exclusive abilities, but does feature some exclusive clothes and weapons. The weapons, in particular, are very much themed after the spy stories Phantom Liberty has taken inspiration from, giving us access to very fun, very powerful stealth tools that will let you infiltrate the deadliest den of thieves without getting caught. If you’re planning on coming back to Night City for another run, I cannot recommend enough that you take a detour to Dogtown while you’re here. Last year, I said in my review of Cyberpunk Edgerunners that CDPR now has a blueprint for where to go with Cyberpunk 2077, and Phantom Liberty shows the studio already had exactly that in mind. Between a more sophisticated level of storytelling with excellent performances, smarter insights on the cyberpunk genre and its dystopian themes, and landing on top of a much-improved gameplay experience thanks to its fresh 2.0 update, Phantom Liberty marks a new chapter for Cyberpunk 2077 and is finally close to what I’d hoped it would be when I first sat down to play three years ago. "
25,Payday 3 ,7.0,"From the city street shootouts of Heat to the creepy clown masks found in The Dark Knight’s opening moments, there’s something alarmingly alluring about the Hollywood bank heist fantasy. Fortunately, the excellent Payday series has been letting me live it out for myself for more than a decade without needing to establish a rap sheet. The next chapter in this long-running burglary simulator, Payday 3, has finally been released from custody, and though it continues the series’ tradition of delivering one of the best digital smash and grab experiences out there, the usual horrible Payday bugs, a dinky pool of jobs to tackle, and a predictably weak story mean it’s not exactly the giant leap forward I was hoping for. Still, if Payday 2’s post-launch support is any indication, this is at least a very promising start for what could become another decade of happily pistol whipping cashiers and fixing drills. Like its predecessor, Payday 3 is a cooperative multiplayer FPS where you and three friends take on increasingly elaborate heists. The extremely thin story focuses on the same motley crew of criminals as they’re forced out of retirement by a secretive cabal of shadowy and generic silhouettes. All your favorite entrepreneurial personalities are back, including Hoxton, the chain smoking mastermind, and Chains, the always hilarious military man. Unfortunately, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the story itself is just a sequence of slides with voiceover justifying the string of jobs you’ll undertake with precious little to tie them together. There’s even a mission where you work with Ice-T… for some reason? (And yes, I do mean that Ice-T from all 500,000 episodes of Law &amp; Order.) Payday does love a good cameo, and though it definitely makes for an entertaining little encounter, it didn’t exactly do much to draw me into an already barebones tale. But even if the story never really takes off, it does do a good job at setting the stage while hinting at what that future might bring.  Within seconds of beginning my first robbery at the obligatory “local bank branch” intro level, the movement and gunplay already felt enormously upgraded. You move faster overall and can do more modern maneuvers like sliding, which I found useful in combat as well as for stealth. Weapons feel more punchy and satisfying, even if they are burdened with hopelessly small magazines and long reload times before you’ve spent some of your ill-gotten cash on upgrades. You can even use civilian hostages as a meat shield now, forcing enemies to engage you in melee to avoid hurting an innocent soul, which is a nice touch. After years of incremental updates to Payday 2, Payday 3 immediately feels like a proper sequel in the gameplay department, even if the formula of breaking into vaults and throwing bags of cash into an unmarked van remains identical. The weapon selection isn’t nearly as strong as Payday 2’s roster, with just 30 to pick from instead of more than one hundred, but the options available at present cover all the bases. You’ve got everything from deadly and accurate rifles to silenced pistols, and there’s a good mix of stealth focused gadgets and tools too, like throwing daggers that are perfect for sneaky tryhards, and devious jammers that can gunk up enemy comms. Weapons can also be customized with mods and attachments that significantly alter how they are used, like putting a scope on a weapon to increase its range, or adding a silencer to a giant rifle to make it an option during stealth runs. Payday 3 also raises the bar with the quality of its misadventures, as the vast majority of the eight available jobs are super well-designed. Many feel like instant classics, like the art museum heist, Under The Surphaze, with its delicate puzzles and labyrinthine halls hiding priceless art to be pilfered, or the fantastic Gold &amp; Shark bank heist that throws you into the most elaborate old fashioned vault break-in yet. Developer Starbreeze has definitely upped its game in terms of variety and quality with these base stages, and I found myself immediately repeating a completed job more often than not, just to practice my strategies and explore other possible outcomes. That said, there are still some weaker levels, like Road Rage, which is a combat-focused mission that has you guiding an armored van on a bridge with very little room for deploying different strategies and no stealth option whatsoever. Thankfully, that was the only one of the eight that was especially weak, and the highs of the good ones far outshine the lows of the less interesting choices. While almost all of the new heists are great, it is a bit disappointing that there are so few of them after such a long wait. Presumably that library will expand dramatically over time, just like the previous entry did, but after just five hours I’d already completed all the available jobs and had begun the endless grind of repeating those same gigs over and over again. The saving grace there is that repeating these missions is a lot less monotonous thanks to the variety granted by added stealth options that make most jobs feel like two separate levels in one thanks to how differently they play from run and gun playthroughs. In many ways the changes to Payday’s stealth mechanics are even more significant than any improvements to movement or combat. Only the most committed and elite players stood a chance of pulling off a totally clean heist in Payday 2, and proper leveling was basically a requirement in order to unlock things like a silent drill to get through vaults before making an attempt was even remotely viable. In contrast, Payday 3 provides new mechanics to support stealth right away, like the ability to pickpocket security guards to relieve them of their keycards, or use environmental objects to lure them away. That means pulling off a clandestine operation here is almost immediately achievable, even with a randomly matchmade group of players only loosely communicating with one another via text chat. That’s also largely owing to the clever and fantastic way its missions are designed, in which stealth runs are now given a completely different route to success. For example, the Secure Capital Bank level normally requires players to go the humdrum path of using thermite to burn through the top of the bank vault then dive in from the floor above before making off with the loot, but this series of objectives smartly only triggers as your primary path once players have been caught. Before that, your crew can take the much more complex and rewarding route of breaking into various parts of the bank to sabotage electrical systems and deactivate security measures to gain access to the vault without anyone being the wiser, which is essentially an entirely different mission if you can pull it off. In Payday 2, that same kind of bank heist required players to follow more or less the exact same path of drilling through the vault no matter your preferred tactic, and to do it stealthily you just had to not get caught. According to Payday 3’s FAQ, real-money microtransactions will eventually be added in the form of “Payday Credits,” a premium currency used to unlock additional cosmetics. However, at the time of this review, these microtransactions are nowhere to be found, so we still don’t know if that premium currency will allow players to sneak around the existing system of cosmetic unlockables or just grant access to a whole new set of options. For now, I’m happy to see they aren’t a part of the Payday 3 ecosystem, which gives lots of reasons to grind activities and spend fake stolen cash on frivolous cosmetics, instead of spending real cash from our pockets. But all those new options don’t mean pulling off a stealth run is going to be easy, and that’s thanks to enhanced enemy AI across the board. Guards now respond to your actions, breaking free of their usual patrol routes to investigate suspicious activity and doing a whole lot more than drawing their gun and shooting you when you’re spotted. For example, if you’re found in a private but not entirely suspicious area, like the back office at a bank vs. the vault, instead of immediately trying to kill you, they’ll simply escort you to a public area and give you a good tongue lashing, which can be used by cunning players to remove guards from their posts temporarily. That smarter AI extends to combat as well, where the police do a great job of swarming you from all sides instead of standing around as target practice. They can also respond to your actions and try to obstruct your heist, like how they’ll pull the fire alarm when you’ve lit up that thermite, using the sprinkler system to delay your fire’s progress. Likewise, hostages are now much more responsive to your commands and easier to boss around and control as you use them as collateral in combat or negotiation. Which leads me to one of the most exciting changes to the heist formula: each job now has specific phases, meaning that instead of either being in unmasked stealth mode or chucking grenades around like a maniac, there are now defined moments in between those two extremes that allow for different parts of the crime fantasy to be more thoroughly explored. For example, the “Searching” phase triggers when you’ve caught the authorities’ suspicion in a minor way and they begin actively looking for you, but all hell hasn’t broken loose just yet, and the “Negotiation” phase begins if you ever get caught outright and gives you a window of time to lock the place down to prepare for a fight or play nice by releasing hostages to delay the authorities storming the place. This added nuance opens up some interesting new strategies, like hoarding as many hostages as possible to draw out the negotiation phase as long as you can. It certainly helps that zip ties required to keep hostages in line are no longer a limited resource, too, so you’re able to stack those poor bystanders as high as your heart desires. It’s also still a ton of fun to make your way down its role-based skill paths while out committing misdeeds, unlocking more abilities within those roles to bolster your preferred playstyle. That could be the The Hacker path, which turns your lawbreaker into a tech wizard who can hack into security cameras and confound security systems, or the Manipulator path, which grants you a silver tongue so you can intimidate civilians and law enforcement officials alike into submitting to your indomitable will. You can have any four of the 17 available roles equipped at a time and can spend your skill points within those however you like, which allows you to create the perfect villainous cocktail without wasting any cherished points on stuff you won’t use. It’s also nice that you level up and upgrade each of these roles by simply equipping them while out on crime sprees, which really rewards you for picking your knavery niche and sticking to it. Even though I’ve come around on this new, more streamlined upgrade system, I do still miss the depth of Payday 2’s progression. This new system checks the most important box by letting me curate my very own delinquent based on the role I want to play within the crew, but it’s also not quite as chunky or complex – and it’s particularly disappointing that Perk Decks have been done away with entirely. Perk Decks allowed you to round out your character with minor boons related to their background, which was a nice additional system on top of the skill trees that gave me another reason to grind. Here’s hoping something like that makes a return down the road. Hopefully that’s not the only update coming, either. As always seems to be the case with Payday, severe and horribly painful technical issues have returned like the cold sting of the law. Not only are the usual connectivity issues back, but there’s occasional framerate hitching, people walking backwards for no reason, and more. Even the menu barely works at times, and I’d often find it completely unresponsive as I spammed buttons before it finally noticed my all inputs at once and did insane things like open the same mission 15 times, triggering its intro dialogue to play all at once, overlapping in a incredibly disturbing way. I’m really hoping they iron this stuff out, but given that past entries have remained busted for months and years before finally becoming stable, there’s definitely cause for concern that we’re in for another rocky ride. At least when you’re booted back to lobbies due to connectivity issues, you can spend plenty of time customizing your character’s loadout. With lots of masks, paints, and trinkets to unlock, you’ll have plenty to chase and can waste quite a bit of time and in-game money customizing the color and patterns on your weapons or the suits your character wears when out committing grand larceny. Like everything else in Payday 3, it’s a fair bit thinner than Payday 2 for now, but there’s little doubt that will change with time as things are added, and in the meantime there’s still quite a bit to unlock. I will say though, I already miss the little card minigame that we got at the end of every mission in Payday 2, where you had a shot at unlocking the odd cosmetic or weapon mod. All those same things are now earned by leveling up and spending your stolen cash, but that dopamine hit when the match concluded is certainly lost here. Oh, and as always, the music in Payday 3 absolutely crushes it. Any disappointment I may feel when my stealth run fails is immediately forgiven once the beat drops and a money-crazed murder spree begins, making me feel like a complete badass instead of a heartless psychopath. This certainly isn’t new for the series, but it’s great to see they haven’t dropped that very important ball. Payday 3 is a solid step forward for my favorite heist simulator franchise, even though that step is a lot smaller than I’d hoped due to a lack of content and the unsurprising but still majorly annoying bugs and performance issues. The awesome combat, greatly improved AI, and especially the stealth options are so massive they alone justify this as a full sequel, and the new and improved heists with clear phases to navigate them are absolutely fantastic. I just wish there was more loot in the proverbial vault at the outset, and that Starbreeze would have used its years of experience in order to ensure this was a more robust and far more stable launch. I’m confident Payday 3 could become the sequel we all deserve with a year or two of updates – for now, it’s a nice start. "
26,Mortal Kombat 1 ,8.0,"If there was a Mount Rushmore for fighting games, you can be sure that either Scorpion, Sub-Zero, or Liu Kang’s face would be on that rock. For more than 30 years, Mortal Kombat has been ripping spines and severing heads, and the latest, Mortal Kombat 1, represents perhaps the most dramatic gameplay shift the series has ever seen. The new Kameo system offers an unparalleled level of player expression for the series, allowing you to essentially break the usual rules of the game by giving characters tools that they weren’t designed to have, resulting in a uniquely dynamic fighting system that allows for some truly wild combos and set ups. Everything built around that system apart from the predictably excellent story mode could’ve used some more polish and refinement, but even with those blemishes, Mortal Kombat 1 more than lives up to its gory legacy. If there’s one thing you can applaud Netherrealm for in recent years, it’s how each new Mortal Kombat game since MK9 has played dramatically different from the last without sacrificing that very distinct Mortal Kombat feel. So it’s not surprising that, even before we get to the crazy Kameo system, Mortal Kombat 1 makes some drastic changes from MK11 that really set it apart. For starters, it returns the meter management to just one meter that governs enhanced special moves, breakers, and now jump cancels out of uppercuts; fatal blows are still around, but are no longer invincible on start up; krushing blows are gone completely; character variations are gone; wake up attacks and wake up rolls are gone; every character is now able to do much more damage without even spending any meter thanks in part to a new air combo system; and thank the Lord, blocked crouching jabs are now punishable with crouching jabs of your own, making them much less spammable than before. These are all good, smart changes that make the action in MK1 feel fresh, yet familiar, while addressing some of the pain points that the fighting game community had developed with MK11.  The biggest new addition, though, is that Kameo system. For the first time in a Mortal Kombat game, you choose a second character that you can call upon as an assist during a fight. Your Kameo is governed by their own meter, and every time you call them in you use up half of it (or in some cases, like Goro’s powerful unblockable stomp assist, the whole thing). And it’s great that every Kameo has at least three assist moves, which adds multiple new tools to the repertoire of any character you choose to play. So, for example, let’s say I’m playing as Baraka, who notably does not have any overheads or lows in the middle of any of his combo strings. That would make him a character you can pretty safely just block low against. Unless… I add Scorpion as my Kameo character, who has an overhead as one of his moves. So now there’s an additional layer to my offense that I can use to try and open up my opponent in a way I wouldn’t have been able to before. Or I could pick Frost and use her low hitting freeze attack in neutral to try and catch my opponent off guard and start up a damaging combo.  Other Kameos can be used to extend combos that typically would not be extendable, convert respectable damage off of small hits that normally wouldn’t be convertible, and some even have more specialized uses. Maybe you give your character a teleport, or a way to become invulnerable to projectiles, or a way to quickly retreat to fullscreen distance. I’m not one who generally enjoys assists in fighting games, since they’re usually accompanied by tag systems and I’m more of a 1v1 fighting game fan, but their implementation here is extremely well thought out and does nothing but improve upon the already solid foundation that MK1 stands on. It’s a rare fighting game that hits just about every note as strongly as Mortal Kombat 11 does. Everything from its methodical and deep combat to its fantastically absurd story mode and its rock-solid netcode, right down to its extraordinarily comprehensive tutorial is absolutely exceptional. It’s only when you get into its drawn-out progression that it trips up: the keys to unlocking Mortal Kombat 11’s rich vault of customization options are locked behind the frustratingly gimmicky and grindy barriers of the Krypt and Towers of Time. This series continues to prove that there’s real fighting depth beyond its notoriously gory Fatalities, and this one in particular stands out as a spine-ripping good time. That said, Mortal Kombat has always had a very particular feel to its gameplay - something that can be chalked up to the dial-a-combo system, having to hold a button to block, and some general stiffness in the movement – and the more I play other fighting games, the harder it gets to come back to. It’s stuff that I eventually got used to, but it took some time to gel with MK1’s unique style of 2D fighting. Once I did though, it was clear that Mortal Kombat 1’s actual combat is as strong as it's ever been. The story mode this time around is a true new beginning for the series, and that’s uniquely satisfying. This isn’t just a timeline reset like Mortal Kombat 9 – the entire history of Mortal Kombat has been re-written: familiar characters get brand-new looks, backstories, relationships, and powers. It picks up literal eons after the events of Mortal Kombat 11, in which newly minted Fire God Liu Kang used the Hourglass of Time to reshape the universe as he saw fit. Earthrealm is at peace, Outworld is ruled fairly by Queen Sindel, and while the Mortal Kombat tournament between realms still exists, it’s more of a tournament of pride and honor as opposed to a tool for realm invasion. Eventually that peace is threatened by outside forces that I won’t get into, but suffice to say, after a few very chill and lighthearted opening chapters with the supportive dad Fire God Liu Kang, cheering on his plucky new champions in their first martial arts tournament, things get very real very quick and the stakes get raised in all the usual ways. Above all, I loved seeing these new takes on classic kombatants, especially those who have historically been relegated to minor roles. Baraka and Reptile, for instance, never really got to be anything more than henchmen in previous games, but in Mortal Kombat 1 they’re major players with their own chapters and defining story moments. Plus, the writing is full of plenty of cheeky in-universe references that felt like nice rewards for being a longtime fan of the series. Netherrealm fighting games have always been the best at delivering story modes that are essentially the video game equivalent of absurd popcorn movies, and Mortal Kombat 1 is no exception to that rule. The campaign has no new gameplay innovations to offer, but its six hours are big, bombastic, well-acted, and ridiculous in all of the right ways. If that sounds familiar, it’s because I said virtually the same thing three years ago in my Mortal Kombat 11 review about its single-player story mode. And if I had reviewed Mortal Kombat X, Injustice 2, Injustice 1, Mortal Kombat 9, or Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe, I could’ve said the same for those as well. There seems to be an “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” philosophy at play with Neatherrealm’s designers, so if you liked those as much as I did, you’ll probably enjoy this one too. While I wouldn’t say anything needs outright fixing, there’s definitely some room for refinement that still hasn’t been capitalized on. Every chapter just throws you into the shoes of a new character without a hint of guidance on what’s special about them – what their combo strings are, their launchers, or their special moves, for instance. I had to learn on the fly by bringing up the move list, trying things out string by string, special move by special move, and by the time I’d finished achieving a base level of competency with a character, the chapter’s over and I’ve moved on to the next. This mode would benefit so greatly from optional, short, developer-led character guides that can get you up to speed on the fundamentals of a character before you have to spend the next 30 minutes playing as them – especially when its tutorials are so good outside of the story mode. Invaders of the Realms Beyond the cinematic story mode, the big new single-player mode for Mortal Kombat 1 is Invasions, which combines the themed environments and rewards of The Krypt, some light RPG elements from older Konquest modes, and the quick back-to-back gimmicky battles of the Towers of Time, packaged in the form of a virtual game board. It’s a mishmash of ideas that sound good on paper but, unfortunately, tries to be a few too many things all at once. Here’s how it works: Almost every invasion “board” is made up of a series of spaces that each have a themed fight assigned to them, like a fight against Reptile on a space called “Look to La Luna,” or a fight against a super powered Kung Lao on a space marked “Kung Wow.” You move around the board conducting an exhausting grind of clearing repetitive battles against enemies that don’t put up much of a fight, collecting a slower-than-usual drip of worthwhile rewards, finding keys to unlock gates, and completing challenges like Test Your Might or survival minigames, until you reach the end. Along the way you might find themed towers where you must fight in a series of battles, with one loss sending you back to the bottom, or you could be ambushed in between spaces and have to fight a challenging opponent with unique modifiers. But even those are often pushovers. For the vast majority of encounters I went into auto pilot mode with Li Mei, doing the same launching combo that would be risky against a smarter opponent, regardless of who I was fighting or what the modifiers were, only occasionally being forced to consider the RPG elements in the chapter-ending boss battles that dramatically power up one of the kombatants in unique ways. Sure, there’s a lot of extra stuff going on underneath the hood in Invasion mode. Every character and Kameo has a damage type, with a complicated type advantage/disadvantage chart, there are talismans that can be upgraded to provide a variety of different status bonuses, and relics that frequently come with both a positive and a negative bonus to weigh against each other. But that’s all just a lot of complexity that doesn’t really add any value to the actual gameplay. Late game boards up the difficulty and force you to engage more with the RPG mechanics, but that’s not much more fun either, since Mortal Kombat 1 is at its best when there are no gimmicks involved. I’m happy to have the option to play the occasional silly match with wild modifiers and themed challenges, but Invasions strings too many of these fights together and expects you to play through them all in order to unlock many of the best cosmetic options for its characters. That turns it into a chore. However, one thing that MK1 does get right is that the more you play with a character, the more you unlock for that specific character. And there is a ton to unlock for everybody. There’s new gear, skins, taunts, brutalities, and even fatalities that come with every level up. Granted, you’ll probably be able to find the input command for the locked fatalities before you unlock the in-game instructions if you search online, but nonetheless, you’re rewarded well for maxing out a character’s progression track. One aspect that Mortal Kombat 1 does better than just about any other fighting game out there right now is its tutorial. It continues to build upon the great work done in Mortal Kombat 11, expertly explaining everything from the most basic controls to intuitive breakdowns of system mechanics, to highly practical tips that outright explain in detail how to approach pressuring your opponent, what to do when they’re knocked down, how to frame trap, how to jail, what all of those things mean, and plenty more. It’s the kind of comprehensive tutorial that all fighting game developers should include, and all fighting game fans should play all the way through. I do wish that same level of commitment was also applied to character specific tutorials, but there are seven combo trials for each character at least, which is nice to have. On the subject of online, it's mostly unchanged from Mortal Kombat 11, for better and for worse. The netcode is good, King of the Hill is back, and Kombat League returns with seasonal rewards for achieving high ranks in the form of currencies, skins, gear, profile pictures and more. It remains a great ranking system, one that generally succeeds at matching you with appropriate fighters and rewards your investment with unique prizes that are worthwhile because they mean something more than just a skin you got from a random chest pull. That said, it’s still incredibly frustrating that Mortal Kombat 1 does not let you matchmake while in another mode. Mortal Kombat is pretty much the only major modern fighting game franchise now that doesn’t let you do this. Not only that, but there’s no way to create a custom room with multiple slots for multiple matches to go on simultaneously, and when you join in on a match in progress, you have to wait for the match to finish and just stare at a blank screen. This might have been fine back in 2019, but the bar has been raised, and Netherrealm feels like they’re getting left behind by the competition. Crossplay is coming down the line, but it’s also disappointing that it’s not available right out of the gate. One thing that can’t be overstated is how gorgeous Mortal Kombat 1 looks. The character models already looked incredible in Mortal Kombat 11, but here they’re taken a step even further towards photorealism without ever causing that uncanny valley feeling. The real star though are the stages — the environmental team at Netherrealm has truly outdone itself with some of the most gorgeous vistas and disgusting looking dungeons the genre has ever seen. Not to mention those fatalities, which are extra gruesome this time around. All of the usual microtransactions that we’ve come to expect from Mortal Kombat are here in MK1. There’s a store with rotating premium cosmetics, which are bought with a premium currency that can be bought with real world money (though you do get a substantial amount from beating the campaign). Frustratingly, you can only buy them in bundles, but the cheapest bundle is only enough to buy a single piece of gear, not a premium bundle with a unique skin. And then of course there’s the upcoming season pass which will include Quan Chi and Ermac, along with amoral guest characters Peacemaker, Homelander, and Omni Man. On the plus side, the Invasions mode itself is microtransaction free. There’s no pay-to-win, there are new boards to play every season, and there are also daily and weekly towers that cycle in just like they did with the Towers of Time in MK11, all at no extra cost. That means if you do enjoy Invasions and its gimmicky battles and RPG elements, there will always be something to play.  Mortal Kombat 1 is another great entry in this legendary series, but it’s not one without issues. The new Kameo system is excellent, there are smart changes to the fighting mechanics that address many of the fundamental issues that cropped up over  Mortal Kombat 11’s life, and predictably, the fantastic single-player story mode that continues to be the gold standard of the genre. But certain elements of online play are starting to feel dated, and Invasions mode is not nearly engaging enough to hold my attention for as long as is needed to unlock a majority of the goodies hidden behind its many treasure chests and gimmicky battles. Still, Mortal Kombat 1 marks a new beginning for the franchise, and it’s a very exciting launching point for the next era. "
27,Party Animals ,7.0,"With Party Animals, developer Recreate Games takes the goofy joy of floppy, physics-based multiplayer games like Fall Guys, Gang Beasts, and Human: Fall Flat and puts its own spin on them. Instead of falling in with the rank and file, Party Animals pushes the genre forward thanks to a thoughtful attention to detail, creative levels, and its engaging, comedic showdowns, though it does stumble over its inflexible rules and local multiplayer mishaps.   You’ll take control of an adorable, clumsy animal with a powerful right hook as you join up to seven other players in punching, dropkicking, headbutting, and flopping your way to victory in a variety of different challenges. Their wobbly animations cause a sticky, moving-through-molasses-like feel to the controls that might be a turn-off at first, but after a few rounds it clicks. Doing just about anything – including walking – has a short wind-up, but the delay eventually becomes satisfying as you watch your party animal launch itself into motion. It feels intentional, and contributes to Party Animals’ overall loose sense of combative chaos. Attacks all have a similarly long wind-up that contributes to the ragdoll nature of your chosen combatant, but when a blow connects, it feels less like a plush pawing from a stuffed animal and more like a powerful pound from a heavyweight boxer. Time even temporarily slows down to really emphasize the impact of a particularly potent punch before your cute little guy goes flying. With three modes, each with its own set of maps, there’s a lot to sink your teeth into here. The main one is Last Stand, which distills Party Animals to its purest, most chaotic form. Each of the nine maps feels relatively small, but they are perfectly sized to house eight-player, every-animal-for-themselves bedlam. They all present you with distinct, clever environmental challenges to overcome and/or throw your opponent into, from a cracking ice float to a high-speed wind tunnel. Weapons appear in all three modes but are most useful in Last Stand because here KOs are prioritized above all else.  Those weapons include giant lollipops, crossbows, tasers, nunchucks, and toilet plungers among others, and they rain down from the sky to help whichever lucky animal picks them up wreak even more havoc. My favorites are the bomb, which can be lit and tossed into the middle of a cluster of critters like something right out of a Looney Toons cartoon, and the nunchucks, which are a chaotic pickup that deals heavy damage very quickly but might also smack you in the face. As players get whittled away things can start to slow down, but most of Last Stand’s maps ensure that rounds never drag on much longer than three or four minutes on average, as it becomes more difficult to survive as time stretches on. Maybe the rope bridge you’re fighting on suddenly falls sideways, or perhaps the levers that you use to defend yourself from a wild tunnel’s gale snap off, leaving you to get swept away. True, it’s a drag to be KO’d early and have to spectate until the next match, but you can fling increasingly powerful items like fish, banana peels, and bombs onto the battlefield after getting knocked out, which keeps everyone engaged. On a few occasions, I’ve even seen a projectile from a knocked-out player determine the outcome of an entire match. The second mode, Team Score, splits its eight maps in half. Four are variations on different sports like basketball, soccer, hockey, and American football. They’re all fun party modes, but they’re not particularly interesting or novel. The non-sports maps, on the other hand, all come with their own unique mechanics that run the gamut of playstyles. In one, you have to carry big chunks of coal to the front of a train to push your team’s locomotive ahead of the other. In another, you’ll launch explosives (and your teammates) across a river into your opponents’ base. Most of them also allow you to sabotage your opponents, adding a welcome layer of chaos to the competition that keeps you from falling into a repetitive rut. Almost every single map introduces new ways to reward you for understanding Party Animals’ floppy controls without leaving new or unskilled players in the dust. Finally there’s Arcade Mode, which is entertaining, but is overshadowed by the others thanks to its relatively small list of just two maps. It’s also very similar to Last Stand; the levels in both modes feature similar mechanics and design philosophies while avoiding the custom-built challenges and objectives found in Team Score. The only real difference is that Arcade puts you into two teams of four with 10 lives shared between them. That similarity is a little disappointing, but Arcade Mode does have my favorite map in Party Animals: Final Destination, where you’re fighting for control of a subway platform. Throwing your opponent down onto the tracks before a train comes is really fun and makes for some tense moments.  It’s so amusing, in fact, it makes me wish I could play it more consistently or in other modes! But because Arcade Mode only makes up two of the 20 total maps in Party Animals, the online matchmaking that seems to pull randomly from the overall pool causes it to come up a lot less often than Last Stand and Team Score. It would be nice if Party Animals included a playlist system that let players opt into whichever modes or maps they like the most. One thing that sets Party Animals apart from other similar games is that it supports up to eight players, but that bigger scope can also kill a small party’s vibe; while I spent the majority of my time playing in full lobbies, playing with smaller groups uncovered some confusing rigidity beneath the surface. Where other party games have dozens of options to customize rules like item spawn rate and score limits, Party Animals does not. It’s missing the elasticity that makes a great party game replayable for years on end.  This problem is at its worst in Team Score mode, where you can’t modify things like score limits or the arbitrary timer that pops up whenever a team goes a certain amount of time without scoring a point. Playing with people who don’t follow a map’s specific objective or who aren’t familiar with Party Animals’ controls will result in matches that drag on because each map and game mode is designed in very narrow ways that don’t accommodate doing something the developers didn’t necessarily expect. Local Multiplayer is similarly stymied by some eyebrow-raising decisions. Mainly, you’re forced into four-way split-screen (causing frame rate slowdowns on my PC) with a clumsy camera when it seems as though a fixed view of the whole map would work better. I felt discouraged from playing locally with my roommates or inviting friends over to play a few rounds rather than just playing with them online. In 2023, it’s frustratingly common for a party game to force local multiplayer into the backseat – here it’s even hidden within the online multiplayer menu – but it is always disappointing. These issues, though minor, point to where Party Animals needs some post-launch love and care. I could very easily see a patch or update fixing a majority of them, and it seems like Recreate Games at least intends to support this fluffy mayhem for some time to come. For example, there’s a full item shop where you can spend in-game currency, a progression system, and a locker system that you might expect from a live-service game.  It’s impossible to bring up Party Animals’ item shop without gushing about the adorable cosmetics you can unlock. Almost every character has a variety of cute costumes that range from cheeky nods to pop culture, like an aviator jacket for a goose, to just plain charming digs that make a tiger look like a champion fighter. They don’t change gameplay whatsoever, they’re just there to look cute.  The version I played had everything unlocked already, but you’ll need to earn in-game currencies to unlock a legally distinct Darth Vader lookalike costume for your duck or a samurai costume for the Shiba Inu. It’s hard to say for sure ahead of launch, but between the Fortnite-like shop and the ways Party Animals’ multiple currencies are displayed, I have a feeling you’ll be able to buy in-game currency if you’d like to unlock a specific costume. (There’s also a blind capsule machine where you can buy random items.) That’s largely par for the course in a modern multiplayer game, but at least here you do earn currency, skins, and opportunities to use the capsule machine as you play. With smooth online multiplayer, a handful of mostly distinct maps, and downright adorable characters, Party Animals delivers a fun party game that brings cuddly, chaotic fun where it counts the most. The intentionally wobbly controls take a moment to get used to, but once you do it’s wonderfully satisfying to land a punch and send another player flying into an environmental hazard for a KO. It does commit an all-too-common cardinal sin for contemporary multiplayer games in making local play less enjoyable than going online, but all three main modes are a good time, especially in a full lobby of eight players. "
28,The Crew Motorfest ,7.0,"Not many things are better the smaller they get. Mortgages? Certainly. Golf scores? Sure. Kidney stones? Okay, yes. But video games? That’s more of a grey area. For The Crew Motorfest, developer Ivory Tower has chosen to give its chunky interpretation of the entire continental USA the chop in favour of something far more concise: a scaled-down riff of the single island of O’ahu, Hawaii. The result is better in some ways and worse in others, but overall it’s actually an experience that sometimes feels like it’s trying harder to emulate Forza Horizon than its own predecessors. I can’t say I blame them considering how much I loved Horizon 5, and they’ve done a good enough job at it that I’ve had many great moments in Motorfest over the past several days. It has the best handling in the series so far, and it does boast some incredibly strong lighting. However, while Motorfest is a mostly earnest romp for car lovers in a vibrant, tropical paradise, it definitely loses some momentum due to its confusingly dead world and slightly uneven campaign, and its omnipresent, baked-in microtransactions are a constant bugbear. After its handbrake turn from an illegal, underground street racer in the 2014 original to the sanctioned motorsport TV show format of The Crew 2 in 2018, The Crew Motorfest has peeled away in yet another new direction: that is, it’s now based around a bustling summer car culture festival. Let’s admit it’s not exactly original, though: the Forza Horizon series has had this patch accounted for since 2012.  However, it really does get off to a very positive start, with a confident and well-curated prologue segment that gives us an effective taste of Motorfest’s varied racing action and – immediately after that – the freedom to head out into O’ahu to tackle the large pile of events in essentially whatever order we choose. Admittedly, Motorfest has far, far less real estate to race on than The Crew or The Crew 2. You can drive all the way around the island in a little over 15 minutes; in The Crew 2 it takes around 40 to 60 minutes to drive from one side of the map to the other. However, the narrower focus has resulted in a map that’s more handsome and densely detailed (and, while it lacks the same ambitious scope, it doesn’t seem to be plagued by nonsensical, procedurally generated storefronts selling chicken-grilled coffee). I do miss the sheer variety of vistas and landmarks of The Crew 2 but there are moments – particularly during sunsets – where it looks quite exceptional, although there are also times where low flying reveals some pretty egregious vegetation and shadow pop-in. It’s at its worst hedge hopping over the centre of the island. Overall, the map is a little dead, though. There are no people on the streets, and traffic is extremely light. Motorfest tries to add zest by tossing in AI racers that spawn in suddenly and dart through the streets around us, but it actually just makes the free-roam driving occasionally frustrating. Traffic cars can be collided with, but AI cars and other racers can be ghosted through. Unfortunately, it’s not always instantly clear which is which at 400 kilometres per hour. Motorfest does have a better approach to trackside smashables than The Crew 2, though, and far fewer of them will completely stop us dead. Motorfest splits its campaign into a series of themed Playlists, each drilling down on either a particular car type, driving style, or other aspect of auto culture. For instance, one Playlist focuses on Japanese custom shop Liberty Walk. The voiceover work here is a little stern but it’s a cool and occasionally educational showcase of some heavily customised cars. Another highlights the history of the 911, which is a clever way to make use of several generations of the iconic Porsche that Motorfest has at its disposal. My favourite so far is definitely the Donut Media Playlist, which is mostly a series of fun showdowns between famous rival vehicles. Known for their automotive apparel and YouTube content, Donut has already had a couple of collaborations with Forza Horizon 5 prior to its appearance in Motorfest – but the addition of hosted vignettes before each race here injects a little more of Donut’s madcap approach to motoring, and I actually found their Motorfest appearance the more entertaining of the two. Not every Playlist has landed for me, though. For instance, I’m quite disappointed in the drifting Playlist. The first few events are passable, although I don’t love that they’re hosted on huge and unrealistic raised structures – including one that coils into the sky like a giant spring. The next few actually resemble real-world drifting on twisting mountain roads, but then it just loses the plot completely and throws us into several traditional races. The pretext is that you’re supposed to discover whether a drift car can beat street cars in a conventional street race, but the upshot is… we’re driving to be as quick as possible and not to look as cool as possible. It’s essentially the opposite of drifting. Why these events constitute the whole crescendo of the drifting Playlist is anyone’s guess. I’m also doubly disappointed that Motorfest’s boat and plane events have been lumped together into a single Playlist that largely feels like an afterthought. Like The Crew 2 before it, the water effects in Motorfest are genuinely great and racing through huge swells is chaotic fun – but there are far fewer boat events in Motorfest than there are in The Crew 2. Aircraft events are again mundane races against the clock, and the planes are still woefully slow. Motorfest adds a Grumman F8F Bearcat to its hangar – literally one of the fastest piston-engine aircraft of its era – but it’s barely capable of a third of its real top speed in Motorfest. Thanks to this, flying feels mostly dull – and it’s not helped by the fact the default flight model is absolutely awful. For reference, there’s an aircraft handling assist that automatically locks some of the flight axes, but the flying feels infinitely better with it toggled off (I’d recommend using the chase camera that rolls with the wings – not the one locked to the horizon).  The Crew 2 is big, confident, and stuffed with arcade racing action – land, sea, and air. There’s undoubtedly something still charming about a racing game that lets us drive an F1 car across the Golden Gate bridge, fly a Spitfire through the Grand Canyon, and crash a monster truck through Central Park, but its uneven presentation, lack of events that use its best features, and absent PvP is a bummer. I can anticipate some resistance to Motorfest’s strict focus on its Playlist approach, and I will concede it does seem odd to have us agonise over choosing a free starter car that basically functions as a taxi to take us to events we’ll complete in preordained “loaner” cars. In fact, our personal cars are mostly irrelevant until a Playlist is complete, at which point we can redo races in the cars of our choice. I don’t really mind this format; I just can’t really bear the constant babble of Motorfest’s so-called AI assistant anymore. She certainly mispronounces a lot of words. The Groo-man Bearcat? Cred-ough? Diss-plin? Are we just saying typos out loud now? I’m a little exhausted with the fact that effective fast travel is locked behind the completion of 10 Playlists. I'm also cynical about why some Playlists can be completed without owning any prerequisite vehicles, and some require arbitrary and expensive in-game purchases. It’s especially galling when, even after you buy a required vehicle, Motorfest literally still “loans” you a duplicate of the car you just purchased to complete the event in anyway. As with The Crew and The Crew 2, Motorfest is still pretty stingy when it comes to payouts, and it’s endlessly tedious how Motorfest’s virtual currency is only ever a button-press away. You could spend a lot of money instantly unlocking all of the vehicles in Motorfest – Ivory Tower quotes a figure of 600+ – but in reality that’s a blatant exaggeration. Yes, there are plenty of genuinely great cars here, but the final figure is bolstered significantly by counting multiple versions of the same car several times over simply because they have fancy nicknames and some stickers spackled on them. Piles of these are also just reward cars from The Crew 2 that can’t actually be accessed unless you already own them there, so 600 cars just isn’t an accurate or meaningful figure for a new Motorfest player. Sure, 13 Mitsubishi models sounds like a extensive assortment, but they’re mostly doubles. The Evo X is doubled again, so a quarter of them are the same car. That said, the vehicles are highly detailed – except for the Vaseline-smeared and completely functionless mirrors – and they generally look and sound great. More importantly, I find the cars feel noticeably better in Motorfest than they did in The Crew 2. Put simply, there’s a much-improved sense of weight and grip, especially when flicking a car quickly from side to side to break the rear end loose. The cars come alive in corners with traction control off, but I dislike how having the driving aids off appears to be a decent advantage for our AI opponents, who seem to get a perfect launch at the start of every race. I eventually relented and opted for some mild TCS to try to level the playing field. If you want my advice, turn on the driving aids when racing online, too. Trying to keep up with other human players in the island-spanning Grand Races in Motorfest’s most-mental hypercars simply isn’t worth the effort without some traction assistance. That said, I doubt I’ll get much mileage out of the multiplayer, as even getting a race has been taking as long as the events themselves. Sitting in a lobby for 10 minutes waiting for at least 14 people to show up isn’t fun. Why can’t we register for a Grand Race and continue to drive around until enough players are on board to trigger it? Multiplayer isn’t the only thing I’ve bounced off in Motorfest, either. I’ve never liked The Crew’s loot-based upgrade system and I never will, and grinding for legendary gold parts isn’t on my agenda (and nor is buying them outright for real-world money). It’s said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. LEGO has Mega Bloks. E.T. has Mac and Me. Now Forza Horizon has The Crew Motorfest. To be fair, Motorfest is a robust racer with a confident sense of style, a quality arcade handling model, and a long list of generally well-planned events right out of the box. However, the shift to a smaller map has seen it lose a part of its old identity, boats and aircraft feel like they’ve been sidelined, and some of its event Playlists work a lot better than others. Ultimately, The Crew Motorfest is a little more Ice Ice Baby and a little less Under Pressure. It’s a catchy enough copy, but it ain’t exactly back with a brand new invention. "
29,Lies of P ,8.0,"You know we’ve entered a new era in the increasingly crowded soulslike arms race when we’re now turning classic children’s stories into dark, twisted Bloodborne pseudo-sequels, but hey: here we are. Yes, Lies of P is yet another game inspired by the dark and unforgiving FromSoftware masterpieces that have captured the hearts of so many (myself included), but it’s also an undeniably impressive standout amid a sea of games chasing the soulslike trend. It suffers from some uneven difficulty and overly linear level design, but its impressive story, extremely well-tuned combat, and memorable areas and boss fights mean that this isn’t one you should miss out on. It’s fair to say that sometimes Lies of P emulates its inspiration so closely it feels like someone else is pulling its strings a little too forcefully, but that puppet show is still a whole lot of fun to watch. It’s both praise and criticism to say that Lies of P follows the blueprint pioneered by FromSoftware down to the finest detail, with precious few deviations. The UI and menus are strikingly similar to every soulslike you’ve ever played, the aesthetic is almost identical to Bloodborne, and combat is a methodical dance of attacks and parries designed with difficulty in mind. It sticks so close to the script that it got to the point where I’d meet a seemingly friendly character and think “Ah, this is the one who’s going to betray me later,” with full confidence that I was spot on in that assessment. There’s even a major boss with the same name and rough appearance as a Dark Souls boss, which is honestly just kinda hilarious.  In fact, this isn’t even the first Eurocentric soulslike featuring murderous marionettes! Almost exactly one year ago I reviewed Steelrising, which has a bizarre number of things in common with Lies of P, from its mechanical enemies gone mad to its trendy and historical urban setting. Thankfully, Lies of P is a much better game and manages to stand out in other ways, but it doesn’t exactly earn a whole lot of points for originality. One of the ways it does set itself apart though is with its story, which is a dark reimagining of Carlo Collodi’s Pinocchio – a story about a mischievous puppet known for telling falsehoods and longing to become a real boy. Lies of P’s version takes a lot of liberty in its much more gory and depressing version of the classic tale, but it's got some nice nods to its inspiration, including an untrustworthy cat and fox and a neat mechanic where you have to choose to tell lies or the truth (which have an impact on the outcome of your adventure). This style of game isn’t known for having the most comprehensible stories and Lies of P isn’t wholly an exception to that rule, but it does try more than most. There’s a whole bunch of dialogue and cutscenes that kept my interest throughout my first 30-hour run instead of just a loose collection of vagaries and hints in item descriptions. In fact, of all the distressing and enigmatic stories I’ve seen in this genre, this is definitely among one of my favorites – not quite as relatable and polished as something like Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, but certainly more approachable than your Bloodbornes or your Dark Souls. It’s got some interesting twists and turns, and a few memorable characters too, like the self-obsessed socialite Venigni, who constantly made me want to speak in an over-the-top Italian accent. As you’d expect, you’ll split your time hacking your way through levels where practically everything in sight wants to kill you and taking on much more formidable bosses, and Lies of P largely nails both of those genre pillars. The city of Krat is memorable and dystopian, while also continuously reminding you that you’re playing out an iconic fairytale about puppets. It comes complete with your cricket sidekick Gemini and your puppet-making father Gepetto, who always reminds you to be a good boy right before he sends you on missions to butcher everyone in your path. You’ll visit a puppet graveyard that serves as a kind of poison swamp level that every soulslike legally is required to include, and an exhibition hall filled with hopeful depictions of a future that clearly didn’t work out quite as planned, among others. Each is thoroughly enjoyable to stab your way through. It’s a little disappointing though, that Lies of P is far more linear than most similar games, with a very straightforward path from beginning to end and no significant optional areas or boss fights aside from the odd side quest that sends you back to someplace you’ve already visited to solve a small puzzle in exchange for a new outfit or upgrade material. Once you’ve played through the story, you’ll more or less have seen and done everything there is to see and do – except to do it again on New Game+, of course. Another item on the checklist is some memorable (and usually disgusting) boss fights, and Lies of P’s got those in spades. From an evil puppet law enforcement official to a hulked-out guy who’s basically just Bane from Batman, there’s lots of big things that need to be slapped in the face. Doing so is always enjoyable, even though they’re all pretty straightforward encounters where you whittle down the enemy’s health bar. It would have been nice to have one or two encounters where they mix things up with a puzzle or trick you’ve gotta figure out to best your opponent – those are always my favorite. Also, almost all of the bosses have two phases, which I’m normally a fan of, but they’re used to the point where it became a little grating by the end. Usually the first phase is quite easy, but when the second phase is repeatedly killing me and I have to keep replaying that first phase until I’m completely bored by it, I kinda just wish I could skip it and get to the part that’s actually fun and challenging. Many fights felt like they put the first phase there just as a warmup round before getting to the actual meat of the encounter, but rest assured: by the 10th attempt I was thoroughly warmed up and plenty ready to take another shot at the real boss. For better or worse, much of Lies of P’s combat draws clear inspiration from Bloodborne specifically, with a couple minor tweaks. You can’t restore health lost from direct attacks by striking back at your enemies like in Bloodborne, but you are given the ability to partially block some of that incoming damage then counter to restore the chip damage you absorbed. The result is a similar meta where aggressive gameplay is encouraged, and that keeps fights moving along at a quick pace – but it also discourages more defensive playstyles, which tend to be my go-to in soulslikes. That feisty combat is extremely fun, balanced, and well-tuned, but you’re definitely boxed into playing in a specific way instead of allowing you the freedom to craft diverse builds, like a ranged magic user in Dark Souls, for example. Another idea borrowed from Bloodborne is that your melee weapon is assigned to your right hand while your left is reserved for a utility weapon that often include ranged capabilities by turning your robotic left arm into a Winter Soldier-esque tool of destruction, and that ends up being a pretty darn clever take on that mechanic. You might decide to close gaps quickly with the quick and effective Puppet String, which lets you tether a grappling hook onto your enemies, or make use of the formidable Falcon Eyes to turn your arm into a cannon and blow up deranged puppets from afar, or my personal favorite: use the Aegis shield to block incoming attacks and dish out damage in kind with a fiery explosion that triggers when it’s hit. It’s especially cool that each of these tools can be upgraded with additional effects, like the Puppet String’s ability that lets you follow up your grappling hook maneuver with a devastating airborne attack. But it’s the new stuff, namely the completely awesome weapon-crafting system that lets you disassemble any weapon in your arsenal and mix and match the various hilts and blades to create Frankenstein abominations, that really lets Lies of P distinguish itself within a very crowded genre. Have you ever wanted to attach a giant saw blade to a rapier’s handle so you could jab with it like you’re fencing? Well, it’s probably not advisable at all, but knock yourself out. How about attaching Mjolnir’s hammer to the end of a rusty pipe? Go for it, man! You do you. With dozens of possible combinations, you’re given quite a bit of freedom to make some silly or surprisingly effective stuff, as certain stats and abilities from your chosen hilt and blade combine for a unique combat experience. It’s a bit of a shame, though, that the best weapons available are legendary tools that can’t be disassembled and reforged into new items, and many of these are so much more powerful than anything you can build that you’re sorta disincentivized from actually engaging with the crafting system the longer you play. With all that freedom to create silly weapon combinations, it’s a bit disappointing that there aren’t any of the multiplayer modes you find in many of Lies of P’s peers. Not having co-op is understandable since it might break any semblance of balance (plus, who wants to see two Pinocchios wailing on a boss anyway?), but PvP in particular seems like it would fit perfectly with the fast-paced contest of reflexes at which Lies of P excels. Maybe we’ll get something like that as DLC, but for now you’ll need to enjoy your neat builds and creative weapon combinations on your lonesome. Another cool tweak on the formula is Lies of P’s skill tree, which lets you upgrade your puppet’s mechanical innards to snap up some seriously useful upgrades, like adding amulet slots to your loadout, gaining additional Pulse Cells (that are used for healing), and increasing the number of consumable throwing objects you can carry on your person. I spent way too long agonizing over each upgrade decision and considering different ways to optimize my build to improve my chances of becoming a real boy, and that was a pretty nice change of pace in between all those unfortunate murders I had to commit. Of course, the main thing that defines any good soulslike is how soul-crushingly difficult it is, and Lies of P has mixed success in this regard. On one hand, nearly all of the world exploration where I was fighting your run-of-the-mill evil puppets and gross monsters was disappointingly easy, to the point where death was a rare occurrence throughout my playthroughs. The same can be said of most boss fights, which Souls veterans can expect to beat without breaking too much of a sweat since they’re usually big, slow, and stupid creatures who are easily confused when you move behind or underneath them and telegraph all their attacks like they’re in the WWE. But then I’d encounter the occasional showdown where the difficulty spiked up dramatically without warning and I’d die 20 or 30 agonizing deaths on a single boss, leaving me to wonder if I just wasn’t properly leveled or something (which was never the case – I just needed to git gud). Those specific bosses stand in such stark contrast to the much milder exploration sections that it can be quite jarring, and I often felt like the levels preceding a tough boss didn’t properly prepare me for that gauntlet; more likely, my skills probably worsened during the stretch of mostly undemanding travels between the dramatically more difficult boss fights. That inconsistent difficulty is even more noticeable depending on your chosen character build. That’s because, so far as I can tell, playing with a Motivity (Lies of P’s equivalent to a strength stat) build is multitudes less difficult than speccing into Technique (its version of dexterity). As a Technique player, your weapons don’t do much to stagger enemies and your ability to block incoming damage is painfully limited, since you only fully negate a small percentage of the attack unless you’re able to pull off a perfect parry. In order to best the most formidable bosses, you’ll have to learn the enemy’s attack patterns and get down the precise timing required to perfectly parry most attacks before finally breaking the enemy’s guard and laying into them with your fast-moving weapons – a process that’s quite enjoyable, but also extremely unforgiving. Meanwhile, as a Motivity player, you can simply smack down bosses with your heavy weapons that do enormous stagger damage, leaving them wide open to deadly executions. That’s pretty hilarious to watch, but also feels pretty busted, especially compared to a significantly more demanding Technique-focused playthrough. Lies of P also just has some nice little quality-of-life improvements I’d like to see carry over into other soulslikes, like how you don’t lose all your Ergo (its version of souls) by dying, but rather have a certain amount deducted every time you take damage on your way to recover your lost currency; or how you’re notified whenever you’re carrying enough Ergo to level up your character instead of resting at a checkpoint, only to discover you need to kill one more enemy and come back. Little touches like that go a long way. Unfortunately, Lies of P doesn’t manage to rid itself of the clunky roots of the genre completely, and I did encounter some fairly obnoxious bugs during my time with it. Among other things there were a few times where I phased through the environment in a weird way, and enemies have a weird habit of just despawning right in front of me like they were fading away during the season finale of a long-running high school TV drama. Thankfully, none of these issues were particularly widespread, so they’re unlikely to drag down an otherwise perfectly enjoyable adventure, especially since performance is otherwise rocksolid. I maintained a perfectly stable framerate at every point in my adventure, which isn’t a given in this genre. Also, many soulslikes are known for having memorable music, but Lies of P truly stands out in this regard. Not only are the tracks during boss fights great, but there are collectible vinyl records that you can play at a jukebox back at your base – and some of those songs are seriously just fantastic. So much, in fact, that it’s become a bit of an obsession to collect them all – and I’ve still got a lot of searching to do. Seriously, that jukebox made me find excuses to hang out at the social hub, crafting weapons and working on my build. It’s that good! Lies of P might not branch out particularly far from its soulslike inspiration, but like a marionette controlled by a skilled puppet master, it plays the part extremely well in a wonderfully dark fantasy world. It must be said that its uneven difficulty didn’t always make me feel like an underdog, especially when playing as a brawny, overpowered version of Pinocchio with a massive weapon, and combat pigeonholed me into a specific playstyle while the levels are less open and twisting than most. But with an awesome weapon crafting system, some really memorable boss fights, and one of the better stories we’ve seen in this genre, I can enthusiastically recommend you spend your time hanging out with Gepetto and friends. If you’ve been waiting for a Bloodborne remaster or sequel that may never come, Lies of P is the next best thing. "
30,NBA 2K24 ,6.0,"NBA 2K24 is like a frustratingly talented superstar who falls short of delivering championships, season after season. The excellent on-court gameplay bolsters significant depth with its dedication to looking, sounding, and feeling like a genuine NBA experience, but it’s sidelined by heinous microtransactions that plague many of the most popular game modes. These in-game purchases aren’t just present and optional – they are essential to compete with other players online. It’s especially frustrating because MyCareer, the focal point of many changes to this year’s iteration, has so much potential. But if it truly aimed to emulate the beauty of pro basketball, it would reward skill and effort more than open-wallet shortcuts.   Despite being a little short on flashy new mechanics to boast about on the back of the box, NBA 2K24 still looks fantastic and its on-court gameplay is incrementally stronger than ever. Topping the list of additions is the new ProPLAY feature, which allowed 2K to take NBA footage and translate it to in-game animations in real timeIn other words, NBA 2K24 is a lot smoother than its predecessors when it comes to movement on the court, including dribbling, shooting, and pass animations. There are fewer immersion-breaking interactions and things feel generally more authentic. This is particularly evident when playing teams with superstar talent. Players like LeBron James look and play almost exactly like their real-life counterparts, and the continued improvement in AI allows the CPU opponent to take advantage of this. I regularly felt challenged, even as a veteran of the NBA 2K series, without feeling cheated. The ball reliably goes into the hands of the best players on the court, and the improved animation makes the resulting action a lot more fun to watch. This challenge extends itself to the offensive side of the ball, where tried-and-true classics like the pick-and-roll aren’t as easy to exploit. Also, off-ball defenders do a better job of understanding their opponent; an example of this would be a drive-heavy forward who can’t shoot, and now opponent players will smartly back off and force a jump shot or to go elsewhere with the ball. Similarly, the adrenaline boost feature, which helps prevent players from dribbling around aimlessly and being rewarded for it, returns with a more interactive twist: Instead of losing a boost for dribbling around, boosts are now lost when a defensive player bumps or interrupts the offensive player’s movement. My experience with this was that it really made defense, especially in online play, more engaging. Not all of the on-court gameplay has taken a significant step forward, however. Fast-break gameplay is still almost entirely nonexistent, which is an issue that has plagued the NBA 2K series for over a decade now. It’s also one of the most fun elements of real-life basketball, so its absence just generally makes good defense less exciting because it rarely turns into points. There are also occasional mind-boggling decisions from the AI, such as calling erroneous timeouts late in games.  You’d think the commentary would call out things like that, but it’s otherwise regularly very good (especially when playing games in the various eras of the NBA), and the ever-present halftime crew of Shaq, Ernie, and Kenny deliver stellar performances. Naturally it’s missing Charles Barkley, who insists he will never be in an NBA 2K game, but the chemistry is still very strong nonetheless. There are some disappointments in the details, however. For instance, players rarely celebrate big moments such as game-winning shots in a convincing way. In fact, they often go from being excited one moment to deadpan the next – something that only really comes across because of how realistic the players look. NBA 2K24 excels at creating tense in-game moments but rarely delivers a reward for them. Having the arena, including the fans, players, and coaches, properly react to big plays would go a long way in matching the NBA’s famous ability to create historic moments.  MyCareer The steps NBA 2K24 takes forward are largely overshadowed by its most popular game mode, MyCareer, and the painstaking lengths it goes through to prod us into in-game purchases. Let me set the table: despite having access to 100,000 virtual currency (VC) that you only get with the Black Mamba or 25th Anniversary editions, my created player rested at a 75 overall after I dumped everything I had into attribute upgrades. I then played MyCareer for about 10 hours, and slowly crawled my way up to an 81 overall. All the while, I’m completely disregarding most of the customizable aspects of MyCareer that make it so fun – including dresswear, better animations, and other personalized elements. I am heavily conflicted about NBA 2K23. On one hand, the new retro game modes have reached out to my inner sports geek and given me a way to replay NBA history in a way that I’ve never done before. Especially paired with a handful of really strong gameplay changes, like improved spacing and AI, I foresee myself dumping dozens of hours into reliving and reconstructing NBA history. Conversely, I now feel completely and utterly isolated from the MyCareer experience. I have no interest in shelling out additional cash (even beyond the expensive Michael Jordan Edition) or grind for insane hours just to be able to compete on the online court, and the density of The City and its shopping opportunities is lost on me for the same reason. Instead, I’ll take my metaphorical basketball and go home, where I can enjoy the parts of NBA 2K23 that I can fully experience without the repugnant emphasis of its microtransactions. In spite of that, I was almost always the lowest-rated player on the court. Even without competing against others online, MyCareer placed me in the NBA as an up-and-coming starter on a team of my choice. As a result, I was thrust into an environment where I was regularly guarding players with a major attribute difference, making playing good defense or offense virtually impossible. When I did step on a court with other players online, no amount of skill or precision allowed me to compete with players who had dumped money (likely hundreds of dollars) into their created character. Within just a day or two of release, I was so far behind the curve that the idea of grinding out more VC felt sickening. Effectively, the only way to play here is to pay, and that’s just offensive. That’s especially absurd when you consider that most people will likely purchase the regular edition of NBA 2K24, and they will be rewarded with a created player that starts with a paltry 60 overall rating. And because of the systems at play, losing regularly nets you next to no VC. It establishes a maddening cycle of not having a player good enough to compete without hope of ever being able to improve them. NBA 2K24 wants you to open up your wallet, and punishes you if you don’t. There is even further evidence of this being an intentional cycle, too. Badge progression, a mechanic that helps differentiate players from one another within specific contexts (such as the “Spot Finder” badge, which gives a small speed boost when off-ball and trying to get into open space), can now move both ways. This meant that when I wasn’t actively focusing on improving a specific badge, it would begin to regress to a worse version. For example, if I am working on a badge that improves my long-range shooting ability but come across a matchup that dictates less three-point shooting and more driving to the basket, I now risk that badge progression by altering my gameplan. Not only does this dampen the enjoyment of being creative, it encourages maxing out my stats as quickly as possible so I don’t have to deal with bad matchups in the first place. It’s worth noting that it doesn’t have to be this much of a drag, either. MyCareer comes with a location change this year: an open-world, Miami-inspired beachfront to roam around in. It’s more dense than the previous city, with just about every turn having a storefront, a court to play on, or something to interact with. The variety of court and game types, such as five-on-five or three-on-threes, would be a lot more fun if the matchups weren’t so frequently lopsided. Similarly, there are a ton of fun fashion items to purchase, but they are locked behind massive VC paywalls. Especially in the early stages of NBA 2K24, I regularly had to choose if I wanted my player to look cool or if I wanted him to play well – so once again, it’s impossible to get the most out of MyCareer without forking over additional cash. NBA 2K24 lacks a significant story mode, but there are a handful of loosely connected storylines going on all at once involving the created player, who is nicknamed MP. None of these are very compelling, especially because MP is so lowly rated when the mode begins and yet everyone surrounding him is comparing him to the likes of Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant. As with almost everything else in the mode, it just adds fuel to the frustration of MyCareer being such a grindfest. Other ModesFollowing up on NBA 2K23’s Jordan Challenge, NBA 2K24 introduces Mamba Moments to celebrate Kobe Bryant’s historic career. It’s not as impressive as the Jordan Challenges, but it still does a decent job of getting into the tone and atmosphere of some of Kobe’s marquee games. Returning to an era where guys like Vlade Divac and Hedo Turkoglue were key players in the NBA is a treat, especially for those of us who were first exposed to basketball around that time.  Similarly, MyNBA has also added a LeBron era to play in, which puts you in control of the 2011 “Big Three” Miami Heat. As I put more time into NBA 2K24, I’ll seek out the microtransaction-free haven of MyNBA and all of the flexibility it provides. I was able to customize league options, like which teams are able to get the number one pick in the NBA draft, as well as a variety of nuances related to the salary cap. While there aren’t major changes to MyNBA, it remains the best place to sink time if you just want basketball in its purest form.  There is also the more streamlined MyNBA Lite mode that served as a nice place for me to set up shop for a less intense franchise mode. It doesn’t include most of the more in-depth features from MyNBA, and instead focuses on drafting, player acquisition, and getting on the court. It’s another nice escape from in-game purchases, and much more welcoming for beginners. The old adage “a tale of two halves” really encapsulates the NBA 2K24 experience. On one hand, the hardcourt experience is as good as it ever has been (as we should demand from a game that iterates annually), and there are a handful of game modes that allow all of that to be enjoyed without interruption. On the other, much more nefarious hand, MyCareer is nearly unplayable unless you open your wallet or endure an absurd grind. Even worse, mechanics like badge regression reinforce the worst parts of the microtransaction scheme. Beneath those issues, NBA 2K24 still offers a solid basketball experience, but it requires looking in the right places. Clearly, there is a love for the game of basketball on display in modes like MyNBA and Mamba Moments. But a lot of that love is lost the moment we’re asked to pay an absurd amount of money to compete in the main multiplayer mode. "
31,Starfield ,7.0,"I feel like I’m the kind of person Starfield was made for. I loved Bethesda’s last single-player RPG, Fallout 4 (maybe a bit too much), and there’s nothing I like more than a sci-fi universe with spaceships, lasers, and political intrigue flying every which way. And yet, a dozen hours into Starfield, I was feeling lost in space. Things never went too far off course while I was flying my rinkydink little ship around chasing down mysterious artifacts and war criminals with a damn fine crew of companions at my side, but man did Starfield make me work hard to get through that opening stretch. Even when it mostly righted the ship and I was loving the story, sidequests, and launching boarding parties on enemy ships, there were still too many problems that constantly popped up, forcing me to curb my excitement. It’s a bit like Starfield’s own elaborate shipbuilder tool: even though you can slap a bunch of high-end parts together and it will technically fly, sometimes it’s just not the best fit. I would expect no less: Bethesda has built out a sprawling universe with detailed lore in which humanity has left Earth behind and colonized the galaxy, but hasn’t made first contact with sentient aliens as of the 24th century. It’s chock-full of backstory about wars between its three major factions, run-ins with mysterious space deathclaws called terrormorphs, pirates, and an immense amount more. I wouldn’t call a lot of it especially distinctive – it’s a setting that’s reminiscent of The Expanse, Firefly, and Starship Troopers, full of references to every sci-fi movie from Aliens to Blade Runner, and of course Interstellar. There’s even a fair bit of Indiana Jones influence as it sends you on a treasure hunt to collect mysterious artifacts. In fact, there’s a significant similarity to what Obsidian created for 2019’s The Outer Worlds. But it’s so densely packed in, with more stories around every corner, that I found it easy to get invested in it – once I learned the difference between the United Colonies and the Freestar Collective.  Creating your character is a matter of picking a background story for them that comes with a set of skills and traits, as well as up to three modifiers. It’s always a bit tough to choose this on your first playthrough, since you don’t really know what you’re getting into and there’s no respecing allowed, but none of them is dramatic enough to really hinder you. Some – like the one where your parents are alive and well (if you don’t pick this they just never come up), or the one where a crazed fan follows you around – sound like they’ll be fun to experiment with later, which adds a sense of replayability.  After that, while everyone starts out in the same mining camp and touches the same space magic that sets off a trippy 2001: A Space Odyssey-style vision, Starfield is an immense game that will send you off in all kinds of different directions once it hands you the keys to your first spaceship. It’s to the point where talking to others who played alongside me left us all bewildered and asking questions like: “Wait, what do you mean you don’t know who the Vanguard are?” “How did you not meet this person?” “How are you crafting those weapon mods already?” “Wow, you didn’t unlock [REDACTED] until level 20?” “What the heck even is a Va’Ruun?” “You met who in a bar?”“Where did you find that ship?” If you’re not sticking strictly to one questline and just take missions as they pop up (sometimes you get them simply by walking past NPCs as they chat), you can easily fall down all sorts of wormholes into extended chains of missions that take you on adventures that rival Skyrim’s in scope. Even after about 70 hours there are major questlines I haven’t even touched, and others I barely began. I’m eager to go back and finish a lot of those up now that I’ve completed the main story. In typical Bethesda fashion, that main quest isn’t terribly flexible in how you resolve the situations it thrusts you into. Your options here are, for the most part, about picking whether you want to be a boy scout for whom a good deed is its own reward, a wise-cracking mercenary who asks to be rewarded after doing a good deed, or an all-business mercenary who demands to be paid up front to do the good deed. There are a few choices you can make that affect who lives and who dies, and there’s a decision at the end about which philosophy to embrace heading into the final battle, but most of it is going to play out the same way because, no matter what, your goal is to solve the mystery of the artifacts alongside your secret society of explorers known as Constellation. I won’t say much about where the plot goes because there’s a lot that can easily be spoiled, but I did enjoy the way it probes its biggest concepts – even those we’ve seen plenty of times before – in distinctive ways, and there’s plenty of well-written discussion about what it all means.  It’s in the side quests that you really get to act out your character’s morals: I happened across a dispute between a ship full of colonists and an obnoxious resort planet and had options that included peacefully resolving the conflict (which involves a clever technobabble puzzle) or stealthily sabotaging the ship and blowing up the colonists. There’s a storyline that felt very Boys from Brazil-inspired, as well as numerous related quests about hunting down war criminals and banned technology that pose ethical quandaries to reconcile. You can join up with the Crimson Fleet pirates and dive into a life of smuggling and general space crime, or take up the mantle of a legendary pirate hunter. Watch: Dan joins Ryan McCaffrey, Kahlief Adams, and Taylor Lyles for IGN's Unlocked podcast to talk through what we're loving and... not loving so much about Starfield so far. There’s no shortage of interesting companion characters to hang out with throughout all of this either. I never felt like my Constellation teammates were wasting my time when they asked to chat, since they always had something to share about their background or a quest they wanted me to help them with. There’s definitely a focus on Sarah, the virtuous leader of Constellation, and Sam, a former lawman with a young daughter in tow who he lives in fear of letting down. However, I was richly rewarded for taking the slightly more eccentric scientist Barrett along with me on some missions, and I suspect the others hold a few surprises up their sleeves as well – likely even the ones you hire out of bars when respectable folks like Sam bail on you for picking too many pockets or hijacking too many ships. But you can only take one person with you at a time, so I have more exploration to do here. It helps that Bethesda has certainly upped its facial animation game for Starfield. Granted, it’s nowhere near as precise and lifelike as motion-captured performances we’ve seen in The Last of Us and God of War, but it’s on par with other big RPGs where you interact with hundreds of NPCs for dozens of hours, like Baldur’s Gate 3. Character models are generally expressive enough that they can do justice to the excellent voice performances.  Starfield’s problems, though, are glaring – some of which in ways that are inherently different from Bethesda’s other games. I have to say that the early hours are pretty rough going, and there was a while where I was wondering if the stars would ever align. So this review is going to go through that rough patch, too, as I lay this out. But bear with me – just like Starfield itself, it does get better by the end. The biggest fundamental contradiction within Starfield’s design is that while this is a galaxy-spanning adventure with literally hundreds of worlds you can land on and explore, it can feel extremely small when each of them is separated by little more than a (thankfully) brief loading screen. The first few times I set out I really got into it: I’d enter my ship, climb to the cockpit, strap myself in, then watch the cool animation as my ship blasted into orbit. Then I’d open the nav screen, select a star and a planet to set my course, and grav-jump to my destination before selecting a landing spot and watching my ship set down in a blaze of retro thrusters and dust. But then I realized that, in many circumstances, I could bypass most of that procedure by just going to the map screen and jumping to another planet without even setting foot on my ship. Put another way, while you can walk across an Elder Scrolls or Fallout world without ever fast-traveling, in Starfield you can’t go anywhere without fast-traveling. A mission might send you to the other side of the vast starmap, but the actual travel time between systems is always the same (and the poorly explained fuel system, which is actually just your range, isn’t much of a limitation). When I discovered that so much of space flight is effectively a series of non-interactive cutscenes, it largely shattered the illusion of exploring a vast universe. It’s impossible not to compare Starfield to the way you freely enter and exit planets’ atmosphere in No Man’s Sky, so it’s a bit of a letdown every time you see a planet and remember it’s just a picture of a planet you’ll never be able to reach by flying toward it. It’s something that happens a lot. The world, exploration, crafting, atmosphere, and story of Fallout 4 are all key parts of this hugely successful sandbox role-playing game. Great new reasons to obsessively gather and hoard relics of happier times, strong companions, and sympathetic villains driving tough decisions make it an adventure I’ll definitely replay and revisit. Even the technical shakiness that crops up here and there can’t even begin to slow down its momentum. The next nuisance that irritated me no matter where in the Settled Systems I roamed is the fact that there are no actual maps – mini or otherwise – to refer to when you’re on foot. All you get is an extremely low-detail display showing you large points of interest – such as the many abandoned research and mining posts where raiders and robots wait for you to shoot and loot them – and the large swaths of alien wasteland and wilderness that separates them. Within a city, there’s nothing to guide you around beyond shop signs and text-only directories that tell you what stores are located in which district, but not where they actually are. My guess is that this was a deliberate choice Bethesda made to mitigate the fast-travel problem, where we’re just zipping through the universe without stopping to appreciate the detail and thought that went into creating dramatically different cities like the gleaming capital of New Atlantis, the frontier settlement of Akila, and the dingey cyberpunk metropolis of Neon, among others. And these places are fascinating to look at. The reality, though, is that this isn’t even how we get around the real world today – not since the iPhone rolled out in 2007 – so it’s exasperating to be in the year 2330 with no comparable navigation tools. I spent way too much time running in circles searching for basic things like vendors to sell my loot to while I tried to memorize the layouts of multiple settlements, annoyed that if I were playing after launch I could’ve just checked IGN’s guides for their locations. The tradeoff in immersion just doesn’t seem worth it.  The third ever-present annoyance is, fortunately, one that stands out as something that can be fixed without a major overhaul. Like Bethesda’s previous RPGs, Starfield is a game that is roughly 30% inventory management… and yet it is shockingly bad at that task. To avoid becoming overloaded you’ll constantly need to transfer the weapons, space suits, materials, and alien goo you’ve collected between your inventory and your companion’s, or to and from your ship’s cargo hold, but maddeningly you can’t view the contents and capacities of both the giving and receiving container at the same time. You’re just blindly dumping things out of one until you get a message saying the other is full. All the while, much of the screen is wasted on an overly large image of an item. It’s a bizarre and aggravating step backward from Fallout 4, and the kind of thing I expect modders to remedy within a week of launch. Those problems never got better during my playthrough – I just learned to live with them. The hump that I did get over, though, is that Starfield just doesn’t tell you enough about how its huge collection of systems work, and it trickles out the cool stuff too slowly. Out of the gate you can’t mod your equipment, you can’t use your spacesuit’s boost pack (which is super useful and fun, especially in low gravity, and I can’t imagine not having it for an entire playthrough), and you can barely use stealth or board enemy ships at all. You have to put a skill point, of which you only get one per level, into those to unlock them.  And yet from the start you can build outposts that are a lot like Fallout 4’s settlements and can extract resources for you, but Starfield doesn’t tell you that you probably shouldn’t bother for a long while. Early on you don’t need huge quantities of a single resource, so it’s largely a waste of time until you’ve climbed to the higher ranks of the crafting skill trees. You probably don’t want to go out of your way to mass produce anything early on, because storage space on the first tier of ships is obnoxiously small for the amount of loot you gather (and there are an incredible amount of minerals and materials that seemed like I’d be kicking myself later for not bringing with me). I resorted to silly workarounds like simply throwing junk on the floor of my ship like a space hoarder, which somehow doesn’t count toward your storage space. It’s also worth noting that the worlds you explore are generally visually different (with varying levels of gravity) but fairly barren and lifeless. You’d expect that from planets that’re mostly uninhabitable and untouched by intelligent beings, but that doesn’t make them a lot more fun to run around; outside of a handful of scattered outposts all there is to do is scan rocks or zap them with a mining laser, or sometimes scan and maybe shoot alien wildlife. It’s a far cry from Bethesda’s previous games, where you generally couldn’t swing a dead mudcrab without hitting something interesting. There’s one part of the main quest that’s pretty repetitive, too. You’re sent to investigate a series of ancient structures, and it’s annoying that what you do inside each one is completely identical. The rewards are different and enticing enough for me to want to chase them all down, at least, but after the first few I couldn’t help but wish that Bethesda’s designers had taken some inspiration from Breath of the Wild when it came to creating different puzzles for each one. It wasn’t until a dozen or so hours in that I unlocked enough upgrades that things started to gel for me. Starfield is absolutely one of those games that takes way too long to get to the good part. But the fact that it eventually did get its claws into me forced me to jettison all of the “More like Starfailed!” jokes I’d been workshopping into space and focus more on what this sci-fi epic gets right – or at least, does well enough.  Filed under “does well enough” is combat, which is the thing you’ll likely solve most problems with unless you’re extremely dedicated to the idea of talking or sneaking your way past most encounters with hostile pirates, robots, wildlife, and anything else that looks at you funny. It’s not bad, and it’s kept me happily plinking away with my tricked-out laser rifles and shotguns, but not especially good, either. Without anything new and exciting to fill the void left by Fallout’s distinctive VATS system, gunplay is left feeling largely unmemorable. Even when you unlock some late-game abilities it’s still pretty straightforward. To their credit, enemies do react in amusing ways when shot in their heads, legs, or arms, and they will sometimes flee when you’ve killed off their friends. This definitely isn’t the first game in which I’ve seen a soldier panic just before his jetpack explodes, but that never really gets old. By and large, though, these feel like they could be bad guys from Far Cry or Borderlands or any number of other RPG/shooter hybrids. I was especially disappointed by the more powerful enemies you run into in the latter half of the story; oftentimes they simply stand there shooting at me while I empty my shotgun into their faces and stagger or otherwise disable them, ending those supposedly big fights just as they began.  Combat is also kept interesting by the loot: the modifiers on epic and legendary weapons and gear have some fun stuff going on. I found a rifle that weighed just 0.14 kilograms instead of three or four, and one that does more damage as my health decreases and makes enemies more likely to drop med packs. I found a spacesuit that has a 10% chance to set nearby attackers on fire and made me invisible when I crouched and held still. Some weapons do more damage in space and less on the ground; some boostpacks give you significantly reduced oxygen (stamina) consumption. These are modifiers that aren’t afraid to be dramatic enough to be game-changers that you’d build your character around. The other side of combat is ship-to-ship battles, which are also fairly simple as space dogfighting games go. Even so, it’s entertaining enough to blast away at pirates (or to become one yourself) and watch the resulting explosions tear ships into pieces. There’s some basic power management where you can divert energy between your weapons systems, engines, and shields, but I never really felt the need to fiddle with that in combat because most ships I bought or found had enough power to go around if I wasn’t powering my grav drive (and there’s little reason to in a fight until you decide to make a run for it). Unlike the classic X-Wing games there are no shield facings to adjust, so it’s mostly just light and arcadey blasting. It’s also somewhat disappointing that the in-cockpit displays don’t actually function – your only radar is directional indicators on the edges of your screen. The closest thing to VATS you get in Starfield is in space combat. When you spend a skill point on target locking, it zooms in the view and lets you select one of the enemy’s systems to pelt with lasers, ballistic guns, and missiles. (This is another one of those skills where it’s a little crazy that it isn’t unlocked by default.) Disabling a ship’s weapons is a great way to even the odds when you’re being ganged up on by three or four pirates and don’t have time to fully destroy one, but even better is that when you take out their engines it leaves them vulnerable to being boarded. Some of the best moments in my Starfield playthrough have happened during these raids as I went room by room mopping up enemies (sometimes with the gravity on the fritz and corpses floating by like in Star Trek VI) until I reached the bridge, gunned down the captain, and sat in their chair to seize their ship and its cargo for myself. I didn’t turn to the enticingly profitable smuggling and piracy during my traditional “good guy” first playthrough, but I can certainly see the appeal of that style of play being more than worth the bounties you’d incur and the companions you’d alienate.  Another highlight of Starfield is the sheer variety of spaceships flying through the Settled Systems, and the fact that they’re so modular and customizable made me wish I’d put more points into starship design so that I could mess with it more and learn the somewhat complicated rules of how to snap the pieces together to form a spaceworthy vessel. It really is wonderful to see your ship on the landing pad so that you can appreciate the scale of it before getting behind the controls. Alas, there is no ability to respec your skills, and by the time I realized the major investment I’d need to fully unlock shipbuilding it was too late for this run. For all the criticism I have with the stinginess of the skill system, especially in the early hours, it does deserve credit for its clever hybridizing of traditional RPG skill unlocks and The Elder Scrolls’ system of increasing your skills as you use them. Every time you level up a skill you unlock a challenge, which might be as simple as killing X enemies with laser weapons or as situational as using your boost pack X times during combat, and this has to be completed before you can spend another point to level the skill up again. That’s a noticeable bit of progression that pops up between levels, and adds to the roleplaying feeling that my character has actually honed this skill instead of magically mastering it.  Finally, I have to make a special mention of the lockpicking minigame, which is a simple but satisfying challenge that makes you visualize how several pieces fit together to fill holes. This may be the best unlocking minigame I’ve ever seen in an RPG, and I put more skill points into it than I probably needed to just to gain access to more challenging locks. It’s nice to see one of these that’s rewarding to do rather than a chore that must be endured to earn a reward.  Are there bugs? Of course there are. Playing primarily on PC (with an RTX 3080 on high settings) I’ve seen a fair amount of model and texture pop-in, occasional crashes, performance slowdowns (mostly during autosaving), wonky waypoints, clipping issues, wrong camera angles during conversations, etc. Though I have to say it’s been fairly stable for a big RPG – I never had a quest I couldn’t finish, for instance. Your results will vary; with a game this complex they always do. On Xbox, our staff has seen a few dips in the Series X’s 30fps target, but nothing egregious; a couple of people had save files become corrupted, but there were always more autosaves to fall back on so it wasn’t a disaster. It’s never a great sign when someone recommends a game on the grounds that it gets good after more than a dozen hours, but that’s very much the kind of game Starfield is, and I do recommend it. There are a lot of forces working against it, and the combination of disjointed space travel, nonexistent maps, aggravating inventory management, and a slow rollout of essential abilities very nearly did it in. It was the joys piloting a custom spaceship into and out of all sorts of morally ambiguous situations in a rich sci-fi universe that eventually pulled it out of a nosedive. I’m glad that I powered through the early hours, because its interstellar mystery story pays off and, once the ball got rolling, combat on foot and in space gradually became good enough that its momentum carried me into New Game+ after I’d finished the main story after around 60 hours. Like Skryim and Fallout 4 before it, there’s still an immense amount of quality roleplaying quests and interesting NPCs out there, waiting to be stumbled across, and the pull to seek it out is strong. "
32,Sea of Stars ,8.0,"I had to go back and play a little of Chrono Trigger just to make sure my eyes weren’t deceiving me about the obvious similarities between that classic RPG and Sea of Stars. This brand-new yet old-school game doesn’t present nearly as much time-hopping or world-traveling as its clearest inspiration, but its seafaring adventure still has plenty of twists and turns that fill up a solid 30 hours of linear spelunking. Rich and often funny character-driven stories wrap up with surprising twists that give weight to the story and provide a reason for its visually wild and mechanically interesting boss fights. At the same time, there’s just not that much depth to its combat options, and its 16-bit graphics generally satisfy nostalgic cravings rather than inspiring shock and awe all over again.   By its name alone, Sea of Stars may immediately sound like a generic knockoff of its forebears. The opening scenes present a story about two decently written albeit occasionally overly talkative teenage protagonists who set off to save the world by skipping over to a neighboring island to kill off the big bad once and for all. Fortunately, saving the world is never so simple, and the story’s true form begins to take shape before too long. The brilliance of this is how many times it twists and turns in a completely unexpected direction before the real ending, and I’m pleased by how it unfolds into a story about the importance of each individual.  It conveys the story competently, without frontloading too much exposition after letting you loose within its first hour or so. I’m impressed by how it introduces its villains, magic, and the stakes of its world organically, and if you want to know more you can simply return to camp and speak to the traveling bard to hear them recount the stories about the world and its denizens that took place there. Speaking of progression, Sea of Stars excels in its level design. This map is split up into islands that are navigated in an overworld that connects different zones with no combat between them, much like in the classic Chrono Trigger. But once you get into a zone, there are often tons of combat encounters and puzzles that fill up the space between larger story moments and boss battles. You get to fight a giant world-eating kraken, and a robot queen that transforms into a giant handgun! And most of them feel like a well-balanced challenge rather than something you have to grind to overcome.  There’s an admirable amount of variety as well. One particularly cool zone had me tumbling down a series of cascading waterfalls adorned by gorgeous plants and flowers, whereas another had me exploring a clockwork castle and teaming up with its immortal residents to face a big boss. It all did a fantastic job of sucking me in and not letting go, much like the RPGs that inspired it. The puzzles are simple but often require a decent amount of thought. There are some tricky block-pushing puzzles and some that require you to remember a certain sequence of triggers to erect platforms in a certain order so you can climb up to the next doorway. Sea of Stars also makes great use of day and night mechanics, often requiring you to shift the time of day with the shoulder buttons to shine daylight or moonlight on special nodes that unlock parts of the map.  It’s cool that this world’s NPCs respond to your actions and your growing power as literal superheroes, and it’s nifty to eventually gain the ability to fly – that lets you move around the overworld and finish up quests without the hindrance of returning to your ship. Yes, Sea of Stars has a ship, but you won’t spend too much time sailing around since it mostly just serves to connect major points of interest between story events. The world’s most interesting side locations, such as the many Solstice Shrines dotting the map, only become available to visit once you unlock flight. But I’m especially impressed by how the protagonists’ solstice warrior powers are represented in combat. Zale is a blade dancer attuned to the fire magic of the sun, whereas Valere is a lunar monk attuned to the ice magic of the moon. While facing a few of the campaign’s biggest bosses and their minions, they are often the only two party members capable of dealing damage with their basic attacks and spells. This frustrated me at first, but as the campaign went on I began to understand its pivotal lock-pattern mechanic. Battles are fully turn-based, but enemies liven things up by telegraphing their upcoming attacks in patterns that can be broken with attacks of specific types. For instance, you can interrupt an enemy powering up a spell by hitting them three times with fire attacks, breaking their concentration, and staggering them until their next move. Later on, these patterns grow more complex and require a mix of attacks from your teammates, and it’s interesting how the other available party members contribute to these fights even without the same damage output. This often lends their unique fighting styles to group combos that can inflict multiple types of damage and break certain locks after the combo bar is powered up through regular attacks. This momentum is helped along by basic attacks that restore MP and can potentially release bubbles of live mana that your active party member can absorb to add potency to the next move.  Each party member also gets their own unique ultimate move which functions similarly to summons in a Final Fantasy game; showing a cool cinematic before dealing a massive amount of damage. They’re not as exploitable, though, since they rely on their own gauge that builds up over the course of battles. It’s great that you can affect the flow of combat by pressing a button to critical hit, critical heal, or block an incoming attack as it lands. I found it satisfying that most later battles required me to hit these boosts consistently in order to feel fair. But it took a while to get the hang of because their reaction window is frustratingly short, and without using a special relic that shoots a flare each time you land a boost, it’s not always clear exactly when you’re supposed to respond. That’s especially hard to pin down when each animation has a different point of impact. For instance, one character jumps around before landing their strike on an enemy, and it’s easy to tap too soon or too late unless you memorize this whole thing. Even so, it’s still extremely satisfying to pull off certain moves that require you to react to these finicky windows.  Overall though, I’m disappointed Sea of Stars’ combat system doesn’t get much deeper than that. With only six potential teammates to play with – and only a few skills and combos total – I found myself running through the same strategies over and over by the end. Often, the most fun part of progression was getting better at precise timing. The campaign wraps up just before the limited combat options overstay their welcome, but I’d have liked a few more spells or combos per character to master. In its favor, there’s a lot of strong nostalgia vibes here. I grew up playing the 16-bit SNES, GBA, and PS1 classics – essentially, the good old days of RPGs –  and Sea of Stars hits all the right notes to make me long for those good old times. Its zones are varied and colorful, featuring emotive soundtracks composed by none other than Yasunori Mitsuda and Rainbowdragoneyes. The former produced the soundtracks for Chrono Trigger and Xenogears – to name a few – and his unique style brings back memories of those old games. Each area exudes a unique personality, thanks to catchy tunes that masterfully capture their essence.  Everything about Sea of Stars’ look and feel is clean and approachable, and each of its menus is easy to navigate. Even its side quests are easy to finish once you approach the endgame, thanks to a convenient map that tells you which areas still have more things to do and find. Save points and campfires are scattered liberally, and it was great to never have to worry about autosaves – they’re placed exactly where you need them: before tough fights.  It’s neat that you can easily return to your camp from the overworld or from any campfire, where you can speak to key characters and craft food for the next adventure. I also liked the fact that healing items take the form of food rather than generic potions. Cooking ingredients are easy to find, and there’s a real benefit to discovering new recipes and taking the time to play around with Sea of Stars’ competent fishing system in order to keep your pantry stocked – particularly because each item has a different effect, such as healing the whole party’s mana or reviving a single teammate. Since you can only carry 10 food items at once, it does add an extra layer of consideration when choosing which items to carry in your loadout, but it never feels unbalanced.  I only wish there were more ways to customize my party’s playstyle, given that each character only has a few pieces of equipment available to them. Unique accessories are sparse, and those we have lack much oomph. This means there’s even less customization than there is in Final Fantasy 16, and that can make the RPG elements of Sea of Stars feel weaker for anybody who doesn’t find themselves invested in the story.   Sea of Stars is an excellent tribute RPG that channels the best parts of its ‘90s-era forebears like Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 6, and even Star Ocean: The Second Story. Because of that, it’s fair to say that its world, graphical style, and mechanics aren’t wholly original, but there are enough interesting twists in its 30-hour story to make for a rich and enjoyable experience of its own merit. This isn’t just nostalgia fodder. That said, its twitchy combat can be difficult to get a handle on, and once you do, it only stays interesting for so long before its limited customization options make it start to feel just a little repetitive. That’s made up for by a strong soundtrack, an approachable and endearing story, and a wide number of fun zones and boss fights that make this a trip worth taking. "
33,Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon ,8.0,"It’s been a hot minute since the last time we were able to pile bunker an enemy mech in the face, but the team at From Software has finally returned to their roots with Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon. It certainly looks and feels the part of a modern mecha action game, with gorgeous graphics, a rock-solid 60fps frame rate that never falters, and an intuitive control scheme that dramatically reduces the learning curve we had to deal with in prior Armored Core games. At the same time, its bland mission briefings and a few elements of its design feel a bit stuck in their old ways. But Armored Core 6 scores direct hits in the spots it matters the most: specifically the highly customizable, intense, and frantic mecha battles. If there’s one area where Armored Core 6 could have benefited from more modernization, it’s in its storytelling. The five-chapter campaign plays out almost entirely over radio conversations, PowerPoint presentation-style mission briefings, and combat chatter that is nearly impossible to pay attention to while you’re fighting for your life on the mining planet of Rubicon. It doesn’t help that our character is a blank slate who just does whatever they’re told, fighting on behalf of corporations, resistance forces, arms dealers, or the enigmatic Walter and his personal agenda. As a result, despite an interesting setting and premise with plenty of teases of ulterior motives and questionable loyalties, I found it hard to really connect with the story on anything beyond a pure surface level, which is a shame because one of the major ideas of Armored Core 6 is a branching storyline that has you making decisions on which faction you want to take on missions for. I just didn’t really care one way or the other.  However, one of the benefits of this mission structure is that it’s able to allow for a wide variety of objectives that each favor a different style of play, which then feeds into the excellent customization elements that make up the heart of Armored Core 6. Before you sortie into a mission, you’re able to equip your mech with four weapons — one for each arm and one attached to each shoulder — a unique head, body, legs, generator, booster, and Fire Control System. And oh boy, are there a ton of different factors to consider beyond simply what to spend your limited money on. The external parts of your mech all have their own weight, defensive value, AP (health), and what’s known as Attitude Stability, which affects how quickly you get staggered from consecutive hits. Parts with higher defensive stats naturally weigh a lot more and require sturdier but slower leg parts in order to carry the burden, and weapons that weigh a lot require larger, stronger, and heavier arm parts. But that’s not all! Certain weapons also take a ton of energy to wield, and thus require generators that have large EN (energy) capacities in order to even equip them. But then you have to balance that with the fact that your energy regeneration could suffer, which means energy management gets much more difficult once you’re actually in the mission. Before you even start making those decisions you should consider what range you expect your mech to be fighting at so you can optimize your internal parts for that role… and the list just goes on and on. That may sound like a lot, and I’m not gonna lie: it is. But still, I felt like Armored Core 6 did a great job guiding me with its sorting tools and descriptive text, which made it easy enough for me to discern what parts were good for what. As long as I had the idea in my head of what kind of mech I wanted to make, it was fairly easy to bring that idea to life. Over the course of the campaign I piloted a lightweight scout with fast boosts that excelled at evasion, a medium-sized destroyer that could wield heavier weaponry without sacrificing too much mobility, and a mobile fortress outfitted with the heaviest and most devastating weapons money could buy – and several in between. What all of this customization amounts to is making every mission feel like a satisfying combat puzzle. Even though there are certainly loadouts that felt stronger than others (hello dual kinetic shotguns on a medium sized bipedal mech), there was never a one-size-fits-all solution to every mission, which is a testament to the stellar design and variety of the missions themselves. You’ll never do the same thing twice. One mission had me investigating a seemingly abandoned outpost, only to be ambushed by stealth ACs that I needed to scan in order to target; another had me dropping down into an underground facility, carefully descending from platform to platform so as to avoid getting disintegrated by the laser cannon at the bottom; and another still had me infiltrating a cave to destroy a generator, which I did, and then had to book it out of there to avoid getting caught up in the resulting explosion. It kept the action fresh throughout the entirety of the 15-hour campaign and beyond. Failing missions is part of the process, and it's something that will very likely happen to you a lot. But fortunately the checkpoint system is fairly generous, and you’re given an opportunity to change the assembly of your mech after every death. This made it so that every failure came with an opportunity to assess what went wrong, and think about how I could fix it. Coming back with the right answer, whether that was simply by switching out my weapon or a more drastic revamp involving changing up my AC archetype, was always satisfying. That said, I really wish that you could also access the shop as well when you die. If you don’t already have the thing you need to beat whatever you’re stuck on, you have to back out of the mission, buy it, and then restart from the beginning. One of the things that I appreciated right out of the gate in Armored Core 6 is that I was able to pick up the controls extremely quickly. It’s all very intuitive: Right and left triggers fire your right and left arm weapons, right and left bumpers fire your right and left shoulder weapons, X jumps, square dodges, circle toggles your booster jets, clicking in the left stick makes you go into a sprint-like assault burst mode, and clicking in the right stick changes your lock-on mode.  I’ve seen a lot of discussion from longtime Armored Core fans who are not happy about there being a hard lock-on system, with the argument that it lowers the skill ceiling, but I think From Software has found a really delicate balance with it. If you turn on the targeting-assist mode you gain the advantage of keeping the camera fixed on a specific target, but you’re less accurate with your shots. As a result, I found myself switching between the two modes frequently – using the targeting-assist mode so I wouldn’t lose track of a fast-moving boss, and then switching it off and manually keeping it in my sights when I felt like It was time to counter-attack. Having the hard-lock also allows for some really dynamic and intense boss fights that would’ve been much more frustrating to deal with if I didn’t have a way to always keep the boss in my sights. More than anything, though, combat in Armored Core 6 just feels good. The wide assortment of weapons all feel satisfying in their own way, whether that’s using a charged shot from a linear rifle on an unaware enemy to kill them in one shot, nimbly dashing around with dual shotguns and laying waste to a whole military base, or juggling quad rocket launchers between your arms and shoulders. Things can feel downright anime-like at times with how many missiles you’re able to fire at once – and with how many missiles get fired at you. In addition to the regular missions, there’s an arena mode that pits you against steadily increasingly difficult one-on-one fights against named ACs, each with their own unique loadout and assembly. You’ll definitely want to go through them too, as completing arena fights rewards you with currency you can use to strengthen your mech and further customize your playstyle. You could increase your damage with a specific type of weapon, increase your defense, unlock core abilities like a super-satisfying kick out of your assault boost, and much more. Better still, you can respec at any point for a fairly modest fee. If you wanna test your arena skills against actual humans, you can do that as well, in both 1-on-1 and 3-on-3 online matches. I didn’t get to test out the netcode extensively in my review period, but the few matches that I did play were super smooth and a ton of fun. And of course, if cosmetic customization is your thing, there’s a ton of options to paint your mech whatever color combination you desire, place a variety of decals you unlock through arena fights, create your own custom decals, then save and share your creation with the rest of the world. Beating Fires of Rubicon’s campaign unlocks a New Game+ mode that allows you to take all of your unlocked parts through the story missions again from the very beginning. There’s also a lot of incentive to play through NG+ in the form of multiple endings, new story branching points, entirely new and more difficult missions, and even a whole new set of arena matches to fight through. Needless to say, you’ll definitely want to go through this more than once to get everything that AC6 has to offer. Armored Core 6 doesn’t look to reinvent the bipedal legs of the mech action genre, but it does update, refine, and polish them to an aggressive shine. Every sortie is a satisfying combat puzzle to solve thanks to fantastic mission design, intense boss encounters, an extremely wide assortment of weapons and parts that can dramatically affect how your mech plays, and excellent, explosive combat that manages to take very complex systems and mechanics and make them easy to understand and execute. Its interesting premise is stifled by bland storytelling told through mission briefings and radio chatter, but this is still nonetheless a welcome return of a classic mecha series. "
34,Immortals of Aveum ,8.0,"Much like the waistband of MacGyver’s trousers, Immortals of Aveum is a gun-free zone. This may sound like a peculiar predicament for a first-person shooter to place itself in, but developer Ascendant Studios has made it work. How, you ask? Magic. And I’m not being facetious here; I mean, literal barrages of brightly-coloured bullets magically blasted from the fingertips of a bloke who really puts the war in warlock. An unexpected collision of traditional high fantasy adventure with slick FPS action, Immortals of Aveum boasts a wonderful backdrop for its classy combat and comes with everything I crave in a modern shooter: it’s striking to look at, sturdy to play, and it’s strictly single-player only. There are times when Immortals of Aveum feels like Wolfenstein with wizards, and others when it feels like Doctor Strange has been airdropped directly into Doom. It’s a curious concoction but it’s one that works surprisingly well, and I’ve particularly enjoyed how different Aveum is to anything I’ve played in recent memory. The firefights are frantic and visually spectacular, the light platforming and puzzle work is generally satisfying, and the world itself is very well-crafted.  Aveum’s arcanepunk aesthetic is very absorbing and creates a world of interesting extremes; it’s a world where magic is ubiquitous and powers highly-advanced technology for war-torn societies still living a medieval-inspired lifestyle. This means wild flying machines and mindbending virtual puzzle rooms juxtaposed against gilded castles and ramshackle timber slums. It’s a cool clash of styles, and straddling multiple genres seems to suit Aveum’s ambitions as a first-person shooter with a twist. We play as Jak who, in a moment of extreme stress in the opening phase of the story, is suddenly revealed to possess the power of a Triarch – an extremely rare person able to wield the world of Aveum's three forms of magic simultaneously. Jak subsequently finds himself drafted into the Everwar – a battle for control over Aveum’s magic that has been raging for millennia but appears to be barrelling towards a catastrophic conclusion. The story specifics get a little lost in the weeds during occasional salvoes of fantasy phrases but it’s otherwise easy to follow – and there’s a steady cadence of moderate twists to keep it from getting bogged. If you want to get seriously steeped in lore there’s a lot of optional stuff to dig through, but it definitely isn’t required to sufficiently understand what’s going on. There are some very elegant ecological and social parables tucked in here, too, and I ultimately appreciated the contemporary relevance – and that the story wasn’t just spinning its wheels mindlessly. I’ve noticed some resistance to the choice to use modern vernacular and colloquialisms in Aveum’s dialogue, but I honestly can’t see myself being as engaged as I was if Ascendant had opted instead for po-faced, pseudo–Early Modern English. In fact, I’d argue that leaning on archaic language would only undermine how otherwise fresh and modern Aveum feels in the first-person shooter space. Not every line lands – and there’s a certain Generation Z angst about Jak that I didn’t always find entirely endearing – but the performances are good and I can get behind it broadly. Besides, I don’t know about you, but I don’t know that I need all my fantasy stories sifted through a Shakespeare filter just to dress up the dialogue with some 400-year-old dribble. On default difficulty, Aveum kept me busy for well over 20 hours to reach the credits. It’s nicely paced and strikes a good balance between switching up our surroundings for new locations and returning us to places we’ve already visited. While there are a few drab and dreary spots, most of Aveum’s environments are exceptionally good looking – from its giant lava pools to its icy and jagged crystal caves. The excellent lighting is regularly a strong component of what makes Aveum’s levels so eye-catching. It’s a relatively linear experience and not a single open world, but there are some maps that are admittedly quite large and primed for exploring off the main path. There were definitely occasions I found myself slightly frustrated at Jak’s inability to leap on and over surfaces that look entirely suitable for standing on, but my bigger frustration was the lack of communication around things Jak couldn’t access yet by design. For instance, Aveum was very quick to have Jak drop an audio solution to an environmental puzzle I was already well on top of solving, but it’s also content to leave me fruitlessly trying to figure out how to get into a bonus area Jak literally hasn’t been rewarded with the ability to do yet. Jak’s list of abilities is, however, impressively long. They’re also rationed out until quite deep into the story, meaning things that might have stumped us hours and hours prior may suddenly make sense. Aveum feels a little plain at first, when Jak is limited to just his initial basic spell strikes, but as the story progresses he gains access to far more interesting attacks and abilities. These include things like sticky charges that have a slow-motion effect, the ability to hover after a double jump, and a lash that drags enemies in for an easier close quarters kill. Aveum is undoubtedly a lot more than a disguised military shooter with finger guns. The finger guns are a fun touch, though, and they’re essentially split into three categories. Blue magic attacks function as a large calibre pistol, green magic attacks manifest as rapid fire SMG rounds, and red magic attacks are essentially a sawn-off shotgun. Red attacks are reloaded by fist pumping, by the way. Now we know what Tiger Woods is doing every time he sinks a putt. However, if you’re worried this means there are only three basic “weapons” in Aveum, don’t be; there are variations on each that change their damage, fire rate, and shots per reload depending on the associated “sigil” you equip to Jak’s arm, and there’s also another layer of secondary attacks – from damaging blastwaves to snaking volleys of magic missiles. There’s even an extremely potent beam that combines all three magic colours in a single, destructive torrent – gushing forwards like someone just knocked Cyclops’ sunglasses off. I really enjoy how powerful this attack makes Jak feel, and it’s crucial in some of the tougher boss battles. Aveum does motivate us to engage with discovering and experimenting with new sigils, although it also didn’t punish me for settling with the ones I had already fully upgraded and sticking with them until the end of the story. There’s a significant degree of controller gymnastics required to get the most of Aveum’s combat. I would also say that, as a man with the multitasking abilities of a peanut, it certainly grazes the upper limit to the amount of systems I can effectively juggle at once. At its most hectic I was nursing multiple ability cooldowns, boosting both my health and mana levels, switching sigils depending on which enemy poses the most immediate threat, and slinging special spells to deal out the fastest damage I can – all while building my big beam attack. At times, I felt on top of it; at other times things descended into panicked blasting. The strength of Aveum is that it all looks rather spectacular either way. Whether you’re efficiently and ruthlessly carving through enemies with focus and finesse – or wading into battle spamming spells and seeing what works – combat is a wild storm of shattering shields and colourful fireworks at a welcome 60 frames per second on consoles. Movement is smooth, and Jak feels agile and responsive compared to the bulk of his foes. Jak is by definition one of the most dangerous battlemages in all of Aveum, and I certainly felt like that most of the time. Immortals of Aveum is an impressively confident first-person shooter that successfully trades muzzles and magazines for mages and magic. Its fast-paced, spellcasting combat is both satisfying to master and spectacular to look at, and it features a lengthy and hearty campaign packed with secrets to keep us going well after the story has wrapped. As someone who desperately hopes that unapologetically single-player shooters will live forever, these Immortals have done a great job of making sure they’re definitely not dead yet. "
35,Baldur's Gate 3 ,10.0,"Every once in a long while, a game comes along that is so memorable, exciting, fresh, and well-written that it sets a new high-water mark for an entire genre. Baldur's Gate 3 is such an achievement for the tabletop roleplaying-inspired, swords and sorcery adventuring that its BioWare-made CRPG predecessors helped popularize decades ago. Larian Studios has turned this corner of Dungeons &amp; Dragons’ Forgotten Realms into a beautiful, detailed world stocked with too many fully-realized, powerfully written, and skillfully voiced characters to count. There are heart-wrenching choices to be made, alliances to be forged, bears to be romanced, and a vast diversity of interesting, challenging turn-based combat encounters. I didn't merely enjoy my 130-plus hours on this journey. I fell in love.   One issue video games have often run into when trying to adapt the experience of playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons on the tabletop is that it’s almost impossible to achieve the freedom and imagination you get to express in overcoming problems using real-world logic. It's hilarious in other RPGs when you have a spell that can blow an ogre to kingdom come, but is no match for the might of a wooden gate. And while it’s doubtful that any game will ever match that level of flexibility, Baldur's Gate 3 is a big step forward from what we’ve been able to do in the likes of Skyrim or Dragon Age. Those gates aren't going to stop a determined warlock. If something looks flammable, you can probably light it up with a fire spell. If you want to save on lockpicks, most doors can be hacked down with a big enough axe. You can get to a lot of secret areas that other games would’ve blocked off with invisible walls by climbing and jumping. I was able to skip a huge boss fight by challenging a terrifying zombie guy to a drinking contest and, thanks to having a high enough Constitution score, I goaded him into drinking himself to death while I was still roaring for more. This is a world that will rarely tell you, ""No,"" if you wonder if something is possible. And you can even bring up to three friends along with their own custom characters in co-op, both online and on the couch. I was impressed with how smooth and seamless this experience was, as joining or leaving a session regardless of where in the campaign your friends are is very easy, and I never ran into any significant connection issues or other online hiccups – though I’ve definitely seen reports that other people have. Given how complex Baldur's Gate 3 is, that's impressive. It only gets better, and funnier, when you realize you can have one person distract a guard by talking to them while the other steals everything that's not nailed down behind their back. There's a huge amount of freedom in who you can be in this world, as well. This character creator is one of the best I've seen outside of MMOs in a long time, featuring 29 different subraces with unique abilities and models (if you count all the different colors of dragonborn, at least). Each of the 12 classes have at least three specializations that play quite differently, with wizards and clerics getting even more to choose from. And I just love the art direction on every humanoid, enemy, and even the outfits. I've rarely experienced so much joy just looking at the beautiful, flame-haired elven ranger I designed outside of Final Fantasy XIV. It's not just the static model, either. The variety of high-fidelity, performance-captured, expressive faces everyone can make is shockingly good for a game of this type, with hundreds of characters rather than a small, core cast who can be directed like they're in a live-action production such as The Last of Us. There's not a bit of awkward lip-syncing to be found. Larian’s incredible attention to detail also extends to the area design and writing. That’s exemplified by the city of Baldur's Gate itself, a hub full of life and adventure that came around to awe me anew, even though it took me 90 hours to reach the titular setting. Almost every citizen you’ll encounter there has something to say about the unfolding events, and nosey exploration is consistently rewarded with new lore, new loot, and new quests. It's downright astounding how much voice acting Larian has crammed into these streets, and how good nearly all of it is. There are dozens of random gossipers on street corners who are just as enthusiastically and professionally portrayed as the main cast, and rarely sound too similar to each other. I assume many of the actors involved must be responsible for more than one of these bit parts, but I can't tell just by listening like I can in some areas of Skyrim.  First among this delightful cast are your companions, a motley crew of multilayered, interestingly flawed characters who both grow and sometimes regress over the course of the campaign. The cheerful, eager tiefling Karlach, who has basically a demonic bomb instead of a heart, quickly became my best friend. I had flings with the dour cleric Shadowheart, the arrogant wizard Gale, and yes, the stoic Halsin, who can turn into a grizzly bear, among other creatures. There are plenty more where they came from, and they all have elaborate background stories and the capacity to significantly grow and change. The main villains, about whom I will spoil as little as possible, are just as richly written, with complex motives and their own individual brands of malice that inject new and greater threats into the last third of this epic-length adventure. I also really enjoyed Larian's approach to romance. Years of Mass Effect memes have proven that it's almost impossible to make 3D video game sex that's actually, well, sexy, and Baldur’s Gate 3 hasn’t changed the game there. We're just not there yet, as a society. Instead of trying to do that and failing badly, they build a lot of the magic into sensual wordplay, and most of the carnal encounters you can engage in are either really funny (I mean, everyone's seen the bear scene, right?), or serve more broadly to tell you something new about your partner, how they see the world, and what they value rather than simply flashing what’s underneath their armor. That's so much better than showing two naked elves awkwardly humping over some unintentionally laughable mood music like you're Dark Helmet making his action figures kiss. When it was time to put our clothes back on and roll for initiative in combat, Baldur's Gate 3 never failed to impress me with the care and thoughtfulness with which the encounter design was set up to torture me. It's like each one is carefully crafted to make me want to scream at the Dungeon Master, ""You bastard!"" And I mean that in the best possible way. One fight involved teleporting imp creatures who garrote my party members before carting them off to separate locations, preventing spellcasting and forcing everyone to fend for themselves. The next might be against some terrifying insectoids who leave everyone literally petrified with fear, so I have to find a way to win without being able to move. The AI can be cunning and savage, especially on the top-level tactician difficulty. At no point have I been able to fall back on a repetitive, grinding routine. You think on your feet or you die and reload your latest quicksave.  The learning curve is helped somewhat by a clean and readable UI that lets you press T when hovering over any creature, object, or key phrase in a tooltip to get more information. It's not helped, however, by a pretty inadequate set of tutorials that takes a lot of knowledge about D&amp;D for granted. I know 5th Edition well enough that it didn't really trip me up, but I can definitely see where others would completely overlook some critical concepts like how saving throws tied to specific attributes work, and Baldur's Gate 3 doesn't care to explain them in detail. You can get by without some of this knowledge, especially on the lower difficulty, but you certainly won't master combat without it. You could benefit a lot from reading the 5E Player's Handbook before you get started, but Larian shouldn't expect that of you. Your character and companions also take some time and experience to develop as effective killers, and the first four levels or so can feel unnecessarily brutal due to how fragile you are when you start out. That's mostly a product of adapting 5th Edition D&amp;D so closely, and Larian’s designers didn’t take it upon themselves to correct this long-running problem from the tabletop. They do, however, often give you ways to even the odds or avoid combat if you're clever – you’ll do well to watch the environment for things like heavy objects hanging from a destructible thread above your enemies, or prep for combat by finding some isolated guards and kicking them over a railing while no one is looking. But once my party got beefed up with five levels worth of upgrades and some magic items, I was happily blasting, slashing, and shooting my way through fights using all of the versatile abilities and environmental options at my disposal. My favorite pair of boots let me teleport to anywhere I could see once per day (something normally restricted to the magical classes,) which was extremely helpful for setting up my ranger in inaccessible areas with a commanding view of the battlefield. I took out some of the later bosses much more easily than I would have in a head-to-head fight simply because there was nothing stopping me from having two invisible wizards walk right up in broad daylight and hit them in the face with Disintegrate before they even knew what was happening.   The story spans over three acts that each took me around 40 hours to complete, playing like an obsessive completionist and finishing as many side objectives as I could. Each has a very distinct vibe and look, aided by an evocative and lively soundtrack. Act 1 is mostly idyllic wilderness, Act 2 is the spooky part, and Act 3 treats us to dense, urban adventuring. It can feel a bit slow at times, since the first act had me chasing down several different leads to solve the same problem, and Act 2 presents more questions than it answers right up until the final set of confrontations. But discovering exciting new areas, strong side quest writing, and those consistently fun combat encounters meant I never lost motivation. The really amazing thing was not how big Baldur's Gate 3 is, though. Much has been made of its scope, but I would honestly not have minded if it were around half as long as it is. No, the magic is in how almost none of it feels like filler, no matter how far from the main quest you stray. Every random house I wandered into or side quest I picked up rewarded me with a memorable, unique, handcrafted roleplaying experience. Even a random note found on the body of a bandit might tell a heartbreaking story about their past, which gives weight to every decision to fight and kill. It’s all there for a reason. And while the first two acts have plenty of difficult choices, the big ones I had to make before committing to a final plan of action in Act 3 are a work of devilish genius. Without spoiling anything, realizing my enemies were so many steps ahead of me by the time I reached the city was heartbreaking, but I still felt empowered by the opportunities that remained to alter my own destiny and assemble a truly impressive coalition of allies. Impressively, the last stretch often called back to things I did and characters I saved 80 hours ago, which tied the whole tale together and made the world feel even more authentic. This is not a story that takes for granted that you are a hero; it's one that truly stares you down and demands that you prove it, if that's really what you're made of. The lead up to the finale backed me into a corner with a dozen ways out, but each one would require me to compromise on what I believe in in one way or another. This elevates the tension and the storytelling to new heights, which is impressive given how strong it’d been up to that point. There were quests that made me cry, quests that made me yell, ""What?!"" out loud, and quests that genuinely creeped me out. And the variations in not only the ending, but also so many other smaller stories, have me eager to play it all over again. And that's really saying something, when Baldur's Gate 3 has been my full-time job for the last three weeks. It does need to be called out for some mild to moderate bugs here and there – nothing that stopped me in my tracks, of course, but enough to be annoying. There were also performance issues in Act 3 that required me to turn my settings down, even with an RTX 3080. But we’ve already seen many of the worst offenders addressed with the four hotfixes that’ve come out since launch, and what remains feels almost trivial next to the greatness of everything else. A game this complex will always have its share of bugs, especially at launch, and what I experienced was a more than acceptable tradeoff.  I don't want to say every CRPG going forward should aspire to be like Baldur's Gate 3. Not everything needs to be nearly this big and ambitious, or even this dense. But it is a landmark moment in the genre, and if I had to point to one paragon that I would like everyone else making these to take inspiration from, this is absolutely it. I waited 14 years for the stars to align again so that we could get the ideal mix of crunchy, tactical, old-school RPG combat, an epic and well-written story with complex characters and lots of meaningful choices, and a level of polish and cinematic presentation that let me see the sweat and the sorrow on characters' faces in their darkest hours. Plenty of other games have partially completed that list, but the last time they all came together was Dragon Age: Origins in 2009. And I can finally say that game, and its Infinity Engine predecessors, have a worthy successor that’s not just matched their RPG greatness, but surpassed it. Baldur’s Gate 3 is just about everything I could have asked for. "
36,Blasphemous 2 ,8.0,"You know those circus performers who contort their bodies in terrifying ways for our squeamish amusement? Blasphemous 2 is a lot like those gifted weirdos – impressive and mesmerizing in that “I just can’t look away” kind of way that’s best watched between the fingers covering your grimacing face. While this sequel definitely doesn’t break any ground in the world of 2D Metroidvanias that the original didn’t, the unique and fantastic art, music, style, and story make an otherwise orthodox adventure extremely memorable. An awesome new arsenal of weapons and an increased focus on platforming and light puzzles make this 14-hour odyssey a lot less repetitive than its predecessor, too.   From the jump, you’ll hack and slash your way through some absolutely beautiful (and discomforting) 2D hallways filled with horrific monsters, perform life-threatening feats of platforming prowess, and go up against bosses so unsettling that not even their detail-obscuring pixel art style can save you from the night terrors that are sure to follow. Upgrading your character’s weapons and health and magic meters, while collecting various passive buffs and spells make for a fantastic climb to unparalleled power, and by the end I looked and felt the part of the ultimate unholy warrior. Little of that hasn’t been done before, but Blasphemous 2 looks quite spectacular standing proud atop the shoulders of giants that came before. The thing that really sets it apart is its extremely unnerving art, story, and characters, all of which are so frightfully memorable they elevate the by-the-numbers blueprint, fueled by whatever the body horror equivalent of charm is. Even by the high standards of the first Blasphemous (which came out in 2019), the sequel is both revolting and gorgeous, with all-too-detailed death animations. There’s one where a flock of owls tear a defeated enemy to pieces, and another where a devout slug monster pops open like a pus-filled blister. It’s all set against breathtaking levels, like one dungeon that takes place in a giant, upside down castle made of wax. That fantastic level of detail is often used against you to disturbing effect, as you’re subjected to some of the most repulsive stuff ever to warrant a good, ol’ fashioned eyeball bleaching. There’s one character I had to interact with more than I cared to who progressively had her skin ripped off throughout the adventure as she helped my character get stronger, and another guy who kept squirting wax out of his breast into the mouth of a giant infant. Seriously, this is one of the grossest games I’ve ever played – which, of course, is a compliment in this context. The story continues the violent and often convoluted trials of The Penitent One, the last living member of an order that’s trying to put an end to the abominations born from a godlike phenomenon known as The Miracle. It’s easy to become confused and left behind by this complicated tale of guilt and religion gone wrong, especially since it’s often told using archaic Old English words spoken from the mouths of cryptic, half-insane characters moments before they devour their own limbs or something unhinged like that. But (and it’s admittedly an enormous but) if you stick with it, roll with the disquieting punches, and maybe read a few item descriptions every now and again, that story is actually really good, even if it did increase my pre-existing fear of churches by 70%. Where its predecessor focused almost solely on combat, Blasphemous 2 spends an equal amount of time testing your reflexes with increasingly demanding platforming sections that do wonders to break up the action. That’s accomplished using the three new weapons that you’re introduced to as a replacement to the Mea Culpa (which was your only option during The Penitent One’s first crusade), all of which come with their own clever movement abilities. My personal favorite, the War Sensor, is a powerful flail that lets you smack bells to reveal hidden platforms and open blocked passageways for a limited time; it also just has a long reach and deals a lot of damage, which I’m a fan of. There’s also the lightning-fast rapier and dagger that let you dash through nifty mirrors to move quickly and pass through certain otherwise-impassable barriers, and finally the well-rounded Praying Blade that lets you do a downward strike that destroys enemies and sturdy obstructions alike. Since you can instantaneously switch between the holy trinity that is your arsenal, many sections require skillful use of multiple weapons to navigate an area without falling to your death, and certain weapons are better suited for killing different enemies. You might start taking out enemies with your giant flail, then use it to hit a bell to reveal some hidden platforms, before switching to your rapier to dash through some magical mirrors before launching a flurry of quick jabs from your blade. Stringing together awesome maneuvers like that made me feel like an absolute badass, and is a huge step up from only having access to the fairly milquetoast Mea Culpa from the first game. A creepy and unsettling action-platformer, Blasphemous has an eery atmosphere, gorgeous pixel art, and intricate animations that never fail to impress. The combat can be satisfying, but relies too heavily on memorization, which makes backtracking through its non-linear world eventually turn stale. And while the visual variety at least keeps things looking fresh, superfluous and poorly implemented upgrade mechanics keep Blasphemous from having the amount of depth seen in many other games across the genre. It’s still an enjoyable Metroidvania, just not an all that memorable one. One area that hasn’t improved all that much, though, is the enemy variety, which remains fairly weak from area to area. Usually after a few sections in one level you’ll have seen the two or three new enemy types and be forced to take out the same bunch of sickos repeatedly until you finally reach the boss. It can be especially irritating when some enemies spam attacks that require patience before you can fight back, meaning you’ll find yourself standing around waiting for an enemy to finish breathing fire for a few seconds before you can counter with a few hits before waiting some more. There’s also a whole bunch of repeat enemies who change their color and element of their attacks, but are essentially identical to the guys you’ve been killing for hours already, like the big knights who have a buttload of health and slowly swing at you with their massive blunt objects. I really got sick of seeing those jerks every couple minutes. Thankfully, bosses are a lot more interesting than the minions who serve them, and each section features a big bad for you to take your frustration out on. Taking down an evil, usually disgusting boss is always a good time, though Blasphemous 2 definitely lacks the level of challenge I look for in my Metroidvanias (and there are no difficulty settings to crank up). In about half the cases I killed the area’s boss on my first try, with most of the other half falling on my second attempt once I’d gotten a peek at their moveset. As someone who really enjoys the trial and error of a good boss fight, I found myself somewhat disappointed that many of these climaxes concluded so quickly. Still, even when they ended abruptly, all the monsters you fight are creatively designed and memorable, like one where you face bullet hell against a priest who keeps switching faces, and another where a robot and his child sidekick team up to send you straight to the afterlife. Blasphemous 2 is an excellent Metroidvania and a marked improvement over the original, even if it did occasionally make me cancel my lunch plans with its grotesqueries. What it lacks in originality with its design it more than makes up for with its bizarre world, appalling story, and inspired look and sound. The new weapons and focus on platforming definitely helped sustain my enjoyment for the campaign’s sizable duration, even when underwhelming enemy variety and unchallenging bosses leave something to be desired. Its stomach-churning religious torture porn might be as far as you can get from the adorable world of Hollow Knight, but you’d be hard-pressed to find something better to play while you continue your interminable wait for Silksong. "
37,Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew ,9.0,"What do you get with a talking ghost ship staffed by a quirky found family of zombies and run by a literal skeleton crew? That sounds like a setup for a Guybrush Threepwood zinger, but it’s actually the good guys in Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew. This outstanding stealth tactics game has you managing teams of magic-infused undead pirates on their mission to find a lost treasure, serve justice, fulfill their last regrets, and outwit the skeletal monkey that terrorizes their ship. The developers at Mimimi have delivered a sense of humor that drives the plot, wonderful visual and level design, and a cast of ne'er-do-wells diverse in both abilities and function. All of that means Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew sets sail as perhaps the finest stealth tactics game ever made, charting a course for the genre's future that's brighter than ever.   Controlling a team of three pirates in real time, your job is to fulfill a few stealthy mission objectives on island maps thick with enemies, civilians, and set piece features. Every one of the eight different islands is an example of the diorama-type design that Mimimi has become known for from Desperados 3 and its Shadow Tactics games. Each of them is a moving tapestry of not just pretty scenery, but stealth puzzles for you to solve and ingenious knots of patrol routes and stationary guards to tactically unravel. It's also by far the most accessible game I've ever played in this genre, with varied mission times allowing shorter play sessions and a lot of easily tweaked difficulty settings broken down by category. On a basic level, Shadow Gambit follows in the footsteps of the Commandos games: you maneuver your hand-picked crew around in real-time strategy style, using their powers to evade, outwit, and take down guards before (often hilariously) hiding their bodies in convenient bushes and the like. It’s not fully real-time, in that you can also use shadow mode to pause, give an order to each of your crew, and then unpause to execute those commands all at the same time for slick-looking stealth takedowns and rushes using your whole team's powers at once. You do all that in service of your mission in the Lost Caribbean, a magical island chain in an alternate version of our own world's golden age of piracy. This is a strange place, one where the dead rest uneasy and some return to life as undead Cursed – and are inevitably forced into a life of piracy by the Inquisition of the Burning Maiden. That might make it seem like you're the bad guys, but trust me: the Inquisition are zealous jerks. Take as evidence that nonviolent civilians are perfectly happy with your rotting crew murdering the inquisition and never once snitch on you for it. It's a setting tailor made for rip-roaring, high-seas adventure, which is just what Shadow Gambit provides.  The frame of the story is simple – a quest to revive the legendary ghost ship Red Marley – but the tales told within it and the characters that act them out are delightful. I was a bit lost in the world’s details at first, but after plowing ahead for a bit I found a lot of delight in the vicious and decidedly unhinged Inquisitor villain, as well as the pirate mythology and deeply strange worldbuilding Shadow Gambit kept throwing at me even hours into the 25ish-hour campaign. Each island is a place you visit more than once, and they’re intricate enough to justify that. Take Angler's Bay, a ramshackle town built on an island where a massive, magical leviathan was drawn onto land and slain. The level itself has distinct areas you learn to love or avoid, and those are miniature challenges in and of themselves – the graveyard is one, the open sightlines of the docks another, and the dense, multi-level slums a third. Know your mission is going to go to the docks? Bring a crew that can swim. The slums? One that's good at moving up and down the rooftops. It's telling that the only real flaw in Shadow Gambit I feel compelled to call out is where it could have reached further, but didn't. For example, some levels change depending on the mission, and every map has a daytime and nighttime version that play differently – strategies like putting out a torch obviously don't work during the day. Despite that, I did find myself wanting slightly more dynamic responses from the enemies – I’m not even talking about something on the level of IOI's Hitman series, but it'd be nice if the enemy deployed extra patrols or was just a bit more cautious after finding dead bodies around.  The tools available to you while you play are a remarkable feat of game design that make it difficult to go back to any other stealth tactics game. You can quickly and easily highlight interactables and guards with a single button. You can see the view cone of any given guard, which is easily understandable as either striped for partial vision or filled for full sight. The most useful of all is the ability to tell exactly who can see a given location or character, drawing a yellow line between their eyes and the spot in question. I never felt like I didn't have the information I needed to make a plan, and that’s an empowering sensation that's at the heart of a good stealth tactics experience. You may not have the feeling of really being there as the mission goes down as you might in a first or third-person game, but you're still planning and executing the heists, assassinations, and intelligence gathering. It's a mastermind simulator, one that creates the illusion of being an incredibly clever planner even when you mess up so badly you've got to reload a save and try again. Part of that's down to the fact that, without spoiling anything, the act of quicksaving and reloading is an in-universe power that characters comment on. Incorporating save scumming into the game design pays dividends in the moment-to-moment play because, even when I had a few moments where I forgot to save for a while and had to redo a big chunk of a level, the sheer options available to tackle a scenario make replaying them a lot less repetitious than it can be in other games.  The eight characters available are each uniquely designed and delightfully voice acted. Each character has their own storyline, both in the form of a mission or three and in goofy side stories aboard the Red Marley itself that take place between other missions. I was a pretty big fan of those, working as they did to flesh out the crew, the ship, and the personalities behind each pirate. Desperados 3 is an uncompromising tactical stealth game that tests your patience and rewards your willingness to experiment. Playing with a charming team of toy soldier-sized assassins in a series of deadly and detailed dioramas is tough and requires a lot of trial and error, but success is more rousing than a whiskey chaser. Dormant for 14 years, in Desperados 3 the series enjoys the most triumphant comeback in the Western genre since Clint Eastwood made Unforgiven. Just as importantly, every one of them behaves slightly differently, from attack speed to whether or not they can swim or climbing, and they each have two unique abilities from the start and are later bolstered by an unlockable upgrade or third power. For instance, our navigator Afia has the power to blink-teleport and freeze guards in time, ship's doctor Suleidy's botanical prowess lets her sprout instant cover, and the noble Pinkus von Presswald can use ghostly possession to take control of an enemy.  My favorite, though, is Mr. John Mercury, the ship's carpenter. He's a jolly lad who loves to sing, drink, hang out with his fish Sir Reginald, and do otherwise righteously piratical stuff. He's also able to sink into a nether-dimension and drag enemies down with him. A handy power, especially when Sir Reginald pops out to distract baddies for you.  Also up there is Gaelle, the Red Marley's master of cannons, whose magical gun can suck up and launch other characters – good or bad. She's a great example of where Shadow Gambit encourages you to use its variety of strange powers to break its scenarios: Gaelle can just shoot people up walls, skipping entire chunks of levels or bypassing the puzzle around taking down a guard on a tower. Her cannon-based melee attack upgrade is also the source of one of the funniest single animations I've seen in a video game: She just shoves it down over a target’s entire body.  In a further brilliant move emphasizing character variety, Shadow Gambit has a system to ensure you don't get too comfortable with any given crew composition. Each mission earns points toward new upgrades, and the longer a crew member has been out of rotation the more bonus points you get when you finally cash it in and bring them out on a job.  The end of the story, let me be clear, isn't the end of the fun. After you beat the campaign proper you're able to keep going to replay missions and finish skipped sidequests, as well as reveal a full list of all the hidden achievements and challenges to hunt down in missions. I enjoyed all that so much that I spent another 10 hours just fooling around in missions I'd previously done to try out challenges and alternate paths – always the mark of a good stealth game – and I'm definitely going back for more secrets and unlocks. Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew is a peak example of the stealth tactics genre from a studio that is clearly mastering its craft. Its mission structure is spread across excellently entertaining levels with rich detail to find and master, while characters shine with voice performances, endearing humor, and colorful art that both delight and impress. With innumerable ways to approach its levels and an extremely smart integration of the practice of saving and reloading into the world’s fiction, it’s firing on all cylinders in all categories except perhaps enemy AI. Frankly, I don't know anyone I wouldn't recommend it to. "
38,The Texas Chain Saw Massacre: The Game ,6.0,"Perhaps as an ode to the horror movie genre itself, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre starts out with all the same joy and promise of a group of friends preparing for a weekend at a cabin in the woods before things quickly take a turn for the worse. While I definitely enjoyed plenty of my 20 hours with this novel take on the asymmetrical multiplayer blueprint, where three powerful murderers hunt down a team of four elusive teens, getting started wasn’t as smooth as it is in similar games and there’s less to do than expected once you’re up and running. Between that and some seriously frustrating technical issues, there was definitely a chloroform-doused wet blanket over the whole thing.   If you’ve played any asymmetrical horror game, be that Dead By Daylight or Friday the 13th, Evil Dead or Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed (among others), then you’ve already got a pretty good idea how developer Gun Interactive’s The Texas Chain Saw Massacre works, to the point where it feels extremely familiar at first, right down to borrowed ideas like quicktime events and minigames to do things like turn on generators and pick locks, and hiding from baddies who can’t be killed. But it also includes some important distinctions that help separate it (at least a little bit) from its peers, the biggest of which is that instead of a group of survivors running from one psychopath, there’s a whole team of psychopaths working together to entrap and eliminate their high school-aged quarry. It’s still lopsided at three killers vs four victims, but that adjustment has pretty substantial implications on the asymmetrical horror recipe, since now both sides require communication and teamwork to achieve victory. In other games, it can certainly feel unfair when one side requires a whole group of people to know what they’re doing and work together to pull off a win, while the other can handily lone wolf it and kill everyone without breaking a sweat. I certainly enjoyed preying on uncoordinated groups of survivors in Evil Dead: The Game last year, but I gotta admit – sometimes steamrolling everyone felt a tad mean. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre makes things a lot more balanced by making the family of killers only marginally more powerful than the teens they’re hunting, as well as being slightly outnumbered by them. The bad guys are still unkillable and will absolutely wail on their targets in open conflict, but without all of that raw power concentrated into one monster, cooperation is required to pull off a win no matter which team you’re playing for – and that makes things a lot more interesting. Each member of the murder-loving Family has modest but useful abilities, like Johnny’s power to track footprints in a handy detective vision mode, or the Hitchhiker's ability to place traps that leave survivors frozen in place. I favor Cook, whose slothlike movement and weak attacks are offset by his incredible hearing and ability to padlocks doors to slow the Victims’ progress; basically, I become the ultimate irritating groundskeeper while my friends do most of the killing, which doesn’t sound all that glorious but you can’t argue with my stack of bodies.   Victims, in turn, have some pretty substantial and interesting ways to fight back or speed along their escape, like how Leland can use his jock body and tiny brain to shoulder-charge his pursuers, stunning them for a good while, or how Sonny can mark members of the Family, revealing them through walls for everyone to see, which helps the survivors stay one step ahead. My personal favorite on this side is Connie, whose incredible lockpicking skills allow me to break into areas extremely quickly. That both counters my own tactics while playing as Cook and also lets me lead my team to an escape at an unbelievable pace – sometimes I was able to get out before the bad guys even had a chance to form a plan of their own. The Victims can also do cool things like sneak attack the psychopaths with a makeshift bone knife or burst out of a hiding place to stun them for a time, or even grapple their attackers in a quick-time button-spamming contest to fend them off for a bit. Even with those good ideas working in its favor, though a lot of wind is taken out of it by some pretty egregious technical issues that everyone I played with experienced, every single match. The biggest one is that anytime a Victim and a member of the Family get into close proximity, and especially when they engage in combat with one another, the framerate takes a nosedive for everybody in the match. It’s not unplayable, but the most tense moments are frustrating to play, since you might lose track of someone you’re chasing due to massive frame hitching or, even if you do kill someone, you don’t get to enjoy your victory to its fullest because even the kill animation is choppy. Texas Chainsaw Massacre fails to redefine Leatherface's legacy any better than the sequels and remakes it leaves in the rearview. Those who only value slashers based on their body count and murderous creativity might give this pure guts, no glory slasher a pass. Otherwise, 2003's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre does ""dark and gritty"" better. Almost every other entry that features a freakshow family affair proves why Leatherface needs his Sawyers or Hewitts. Texas Chainsaw Massacre stinks like a basement full of corpses as Leatherface becomes just another hulking villain — not exactly the fresh start franchise diehards might have otherwise welcomed. This bug was so common, in fact, that our team actually began to use the framerate dip as a callout – whenever we noticed massive lag and hitching we’d all start shouting, “Uh-oh! Who’s in trouble? Where are you at?” I’ve never seen such a reliable dip in performance before, and the fact that it was so consistent that it had an impact on our strategy is both hilarious and sad. Beyond that, there’s also mid-game disconnects that’ll ruin your match, and some weird issues when trying to gather a party together. Our friends would get error messages when trying to group up, forcing us to spend whole blocks of time troubleshooting before we could even start a match. I even had one match where my character just became frozen in place indefinitely, forcing me to back out of the session (with no option to rejoin). It’s always hard to say how painful issues like these will be in the days and weeks after launch, but even with the much smaller player pools during the review period where I knew that everybody was playing on good PCs with reliable connections it was almost always an unstable experience, and that doesn’t seem like a good sign. The good news is that, even with rocky technical performance putting a damper on things, each match has a compelling back-and-forth where survivors work to avoid notice and find a way out of the death trap they’re stuck in, and maniacs keep the pressure on and lock down the level as much as possible until they can eliminate their captives. The Family definitely has the more engaging set of objectives, since they’re not only hunting the survivors but setting traps and adding additional obstacles to the mix, like turning on generators that activate electrical barriers that then have to be turned off by the Victims. But they also spend their time leveling up their patriarch, Grandpa, who drinks blood you collect from Victims and find in the environment, and as he gains in power it becomes increasingly easier to detect where the remaining survivors are in the process.  Naturally, setting the perfect trap for your prey and then slowly closing in for the kill is an exceeding thrill, especially when my traps forced someone to jump out of a window in desperation, killing themselves on my behalf. Moments like that allowed me to embrace my inner sadist and put a smile on my face. Victims, on the other hand, mostly rely on stealth to complete their pretty boring objectives, all of which are permutations of the same thing: open a door somewhere so you can leave. Sometimes that’s as easy as finding a few lockpicks and opening a couple doors to leave, especially if your pursuers are doing a bad job of herding you away from it, but there are a few slightly more complicated options like using one exit that opens on a timer when you fix a pressure valve, and another that opens up a tunnel exit when you solve a simple circuitry puzzle at a fuse box. Thankfully, despite the uncreative errands you have to complete to escape, it’s still undoubtedly a good time cooperating with your fellow Victims and narrowly avoiding detection by the bad guys, or better yet: making it out of the final exit by the skin of your teeth with all three murderers hot on your heels. With such a good baseline, it’s pretty disappointing that there are only three maps and a single game mode to choose from, each with only the most minor of permutations from match to match. The Gas Station, The Family House, and The Slaughterhouse are all varied and well-designed maps in terms of layout, but they bizarrely all have the same set of four exits in the same general places for Victims to escape through and Family to guard. Once you’ve played a level once or twice, all the novelty of emerging from the basement to an unfamiliar area that you then need to escape is lost, and it’s super weird that there isn’t any special way for me to escape The Slaughterhouse versus The Family House. You’re telling me that both of these places have exactly one pressure-released exit and one tunnel exit with a broken fuse box? That just feels like it was copied and pasted. It’s also pretty odd that there’s no real tutorial or single-player with bots mode to be found, leaving little recourse for those learning the ropes or trying to sharpen their skills. The only way to learn the rules without playing is by watching an extensive library of extremely dry videos, only a couple of which even bother with voiceover explanations, leaving you to read for like 30 minutes and then hope you have a great memory. Since most people probably won’t have the stomach for that and will jump right into playing matches, you’ll likely encounter lots of players who don’t know what they’re doing, which can be an extremely frustrating experience when they’re on your team – and they’re not even that satisfying to kill. Since I’d gone to the trouble of reading everything and played 20 hours worth of matches in just a few days, I had the privilege of guiding my teammates to frequent victories, but every once in a while I’d find someone without a mic who would just ruin my day.   In one match, one of my fellow murderers was a mic-less novice who kept opening locked doors and leaving them wide open for Victims to slip through, which of course they did, costing us the match. I couldn’t tell him that he was screwing us over, so I had to split my time between finding the Victims and closing doors behind my clueless teammate. Those matches were very much not a fun experience, and felt like it could have been easily avoided with a simple tutorial like you see in other similar games. Without that, I predict lots of matches will be ruined, with frustrated veterans losing patience with their newbie teammates and quitting the match early. Hopefully they’ll be incentivized to stick around because playing matches earns you XP that can be used to level up your characters. It’s typical stuff like improvements to your stats so you do things like take more damage, increase your stamina meter, or collect more blood to feed your creepy grandparent. There’s also a pretty extensive skill tree and loadout system that allow you to customize your characters to alter how their signature abilities work and give some helpful perks, like the ability to detect lockpicks in your vicinity in the opening moments of a match as a Victim. So even when most of the novelty of the single game mode wears thin, at least there’s something to keep people around.  You’ll also unlock cosmetic outfits for each character that add some nice flair and probably make you easier to spot while hiding, but hey, you can’t put a price on swagger. I also have to give credit for how much love for the original 1974 movie has been packed into this thing, from faithfully recreated characters to tons of behind-the-scenes photos that can be unlocked and browsed while in the main menu. They even got Kane Hodder, the stuntman who portrayed Leatherface in one of the movies, to do motion capture for the iconic character in this! Those are all such nice, authentic touches for longtime fans looking to nerd out. I have little doubt that in a year or two, when they’ve added more scenarios and maps, fixed the most pressing technical issues, and maybe thought up a better way for newcomers to learn how to play, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre will become a staple in my growing asymmetrical horror games library. For now, however, my recommendation comes with a lot of caveats. While the less lopsided take on the asymmetrical horror format definitely works, the shallow number of samey maps can get monotonous pretty quickly, and even with a fair number of playable characters and a solid progression system, I found myself way too comfortable with the three scenarios after just a few hours. Still, the potential behind this format and the reverence for the beloved horror classic it’s based on is clear, even when it does feel a tad half-baked coming out the gates. "
39,Atlas Fallen ,7.0,"I keep wanting to love Atlas Fallen. I mean, it’s a delightful Prince of Persia-inspired open-world action RPG with big ideas, big monsters, and even bigger weapons to fight them with, so it’s got that going for it. And I did enjoy myself as I explored each of its four unique zones, which stretch as far as the eye can see and deliver some mouthwatering, if kinda washed out, vistas. After spending about 18 hours with its mix of respectable monster slaying and brisk platforming, I can comfortably say it’s a good time – especially if you bring a friend into its seamless drop-in co-op. At the same time, its C-tier story is so campy and bone-dry – in both writing and character performance – that it’s clear Atlas has fallen a notch or two.   The middling story, which centers around a generic clash between a human rebellion and a tyrannical regime, starts out rough. No, there are relatively few bugs and the opening is pretty short – I mean, like, physically rough for my custom avatar, a rugged yet scholarly desert dweller. After a few introductory conversations with other desert dwellers in the first area, it was promptly implied that he’d been blasted in the face with a whole bunch of sand and left for dead before the opening cutscene, which kinda sucks considering his indentured servitude as one of the Unnamed. That’s the bottom caste of Atlas Fallen’s sand-strewn medieval world – which, as we learn through some apocalyptic mumbo jumbo narration – is ruled by an evil sun god named Thelos and ravaged by giant sand monsters called wraiths. This is a pretty cool setup, but the execution of the plot that follows is thinner than the middle of an hourglass. For example, poorly synced lip movements and unenthusiastic voice acting sap the life out of cutscenes. On top of that, there’s no action in any of them, so they’re pretty dull – and each of Atlas’ major characters is a cardboard cutout with no personality to speak of. You’ve got the generic thief with the heart of gold, the upstanding knight girl who introduces herself by punching said golden-hearted thief in the face (but secretly has a soft spot the whole time,) and Nyaal, the other sun god. He spends his waking hours talking at you while looking like a knockoff of Jake Sully from Avatar, but more importantly, he inhabits the magical gauntlet at the center of the story which gives you your powers and a new hope for the rebellion against Thelos and his imperialist thugs. Unfortunately, this sun god is always there with you and rarely shuts up.  Luckily, if you can ignore all that, it’s relatively easy to see Atlas Fallen’s joy as an online co-op adventure where you and a friend run around a sprawling open world battling monsters. It’s a well-crafted map, with plenty of opportunity to unearth rare treasures, build up powerful characters, fight big monsters, do a little platforming – or just chill out and collect cosmetics for the excellent transmogrification system to your heart’s content. It balances simplicity and depth so expertly that it’s easily one of the best games to share between two online friends since It Takes Two.  That’s especially true when you get into the rhythm of the open questing system: this game lets you complete side-quests and interstitials between major story events separately while enjoying the same rewards – even when you’re across the world from one another. Given just how many main story quests scatter you to the wind in search of hidden gauntlet pieces, it’s fantastic to be able to freely split up and cover more ground – who knows, your friend might find something you missed instead of making you run around in circles or backtrack by yourself. That said, it’s a missed opportunity that couch co-op is nowhere to be found, and it’s thoroughly disappointing there’s no cross-play to let you and your buddies on other platforms team up. It’s clear that the main quest is paced around unlocking new mechanics rather than telling a good story. Atlas Fallen spreads its story across four open-world maps, such as the underground fortress of Bastengar and the crater-filled Wildlands, each of which carries a distinct vibe and is packed with enough hidden treasure and decently rewarding side-quests to feel like there’s always something new to find.  Fetch quests make up the bulk of it, with Nyaal frequently asking you to “find three shards” to complete the latest relic and achieve the next major gauntlet upgrade. But I didn’t feel like I needed to work overly hard to find each of the scattered components, and the rewards were always worthwhile. For instance, unlocking the triple air dash was a game-changer that let me reach distant ledges, and Reveal lets you manipulate ancient artifacts that reveal hidden platforming challenges you didn’t even know were there.  Both of these new abilities unlock previously inaccessible areas, giving all four zones extra room to breathe and slowly unravel themselves to those willing to backtrack. But Atlas Fallen doesn’t power-gate its best loot behind that kind of repeated searching, meaning you can choose to only do the main story, skip all that extra spelunking, and comfortably beat the rather underwhelming final boss without the added trouble.   That said, the one thing you can’t skip is sand. Your weapons are made of sand, you move around quickly by surfing across sand dunes, and each of the various monsters is literally made of sand. The only things not made of sand are the many anvils found dotted across the world of Atlas Fallen, which serve as places to save your game, upgrade your armor, and fast-travel to other anvils. Still, that’s a lot of sand in one land, let alone to conjure out of one hand – but there’s enough variety within this concept to not feel overly repetitive. Boss fights, quests, and random finds often give way to useful loot, armor, and Essence Stones that contribute to the deep customization and combat systems. Granted, many of these finds are cosmetic or simply merchant fodder with some bits of lore attached, but all the rare crafting items and Essence Dust (basically, Atlas’ version of experience points) make all that treasure-hunting feel worthwhile, even when there isn’t another powerful Essence Stone or armor piece around the next corner.  Meanwhile, power climb feels steady from start to finish – making combat encounters balanced as you venture into higher level zones, without making you grind for it – as long as you’re upgrading your armor, perks, Idols, Essence Stones, and Momentum Gauge at an anvil every so often. Those all help with a different aspect of character customization, but the main driver is your armor, which determines your character’s level and most of your combat stats like how much damage your attacks deal and how quickly your health can regenerate mid-combat. Speaking of combat, Atlas Fallen’s action-packed battles are simple but highly dynamic, thanks to a small number of moves that grow in power as you land hits. Fights center around two basic attacks that work differently based on the weapon you assign them to, but the twist is that your character’s movement style changes depending on which weapon you strike with. For instance, the sword-like Sandwhip homes in on an enemy from a distance before pushing you backward, letting you whip around the enemy mid-air if you dodge around mid-combo like Sora from Kingdom Hearts. Alternatively, the punchy Knuckledust lunges you forward as you pulverize your opponents with both hands. There are three of these, and they all encourage very different styles. Atlas Fallen also includes a deeply satisfying parry button, offering a generous window to counter enemy attacks, and a perfectly timed parry can turn the tides of any battle by freezing opponents. There’s also a two-handed slam attack that combines the styles of both equipped weapons, and you can top a chain of attacks off with an extremely powerful finishing move. That’s plenty to keep anyone busy in a typical encounter against a group of two or three large enemies like the marauding Tailguarder and the giant crab-like Shellbasher. And it’s a lot of fun to bring these bigger foes down piece by piece – it reminds me of hunting Rathalos across a vast desert in Monster Hunter. I’m delighted at how Atlas keeps a nice balance between its moment-to-moment smashing and slashing and its resource management systems. This is thanks to the Momentum Gauge, which fills up as you land direct hits and successful parries against enemies, gradually unlocking abilities you’ve slotted along the gauge. These collectable abilities make up the meat of Atlas Fallen’s customization, and they can be crafted, upgraded, and mixed and matched to build any sort of character you’d want – including healers, damage dealers, crowd controllers, tanks, you name it. One of my favorite Essence Stones is the Evasive Burst, which creates a shockwave after every dodge roll or air dash while active. This let me deal incredible amounts of damage while whipping around airborne foes with the Sandwhip. The catch is that it can be difficult to maintain high momentum since you receive more damage as your gauge reaches its limit. This risk and reward element keeps things interesting, since the strongest abilities sit on the upper end of the gauge, and it’s always tempting to unleash your highly gratifying finishing move to deal heavy damage at the cost of reducing your gauge to zero. It all comes together toward the end of the campaign, where every other fight has several enemy types filling the screen with lighting effects and clouds of yellowy dust – it’s kind of like the heavier moments of Doom Eternal, but with sand instead of viscera.  I’ve developed what I can best describe as a “love-hate” relationship with Atlas Fallen’s visual style. I’d often be wowed at how gorgeous some of its zones look – some of it made me feel as if I were standing inside a piece of elegant concept art. Especially once I’d unlocked my favorite suit of armor: Red Company, a suit that gleams brilliantly in direct sunlight as tufts of fabric unfurl around it. That looks fantastic on its own, but even better once I’ve dyed it with gold and blue dye I purchased from a traveling merchant. I’m also pleased that Atlas Fallen produces consistently high frames in the PS5’s Performance mode, but I’m not as impressed that it struggles with its fidelity even in Graphics mode – which is a shame because of how pretty and detailed its zones and armor designs are. Many of its animations are clunky, but what really bothers me is the compressed textures, low-quality models, and graininess that look flat-out ugly on my PS5 in both visual modes, as if I were playing a poorly made port of a Nintendo Switch game. Atlas looks much clearer on PC with none of the aforementioned compression issues, but its character models still evoke the uncanny valley more than most games. Atlas Fallen is a solid open-world action RPG with plenty of platforming and large monsters to fight. Putting aside its weak story and the console versions’ gritty graphics there’s a hidden gem of excellent combat, robust exploration, and surprisingly deep customization to uncover in the sinking sands of its arid wilderness. It’s slightly disappointing that co-op is online-only with no cross-play, but thanks to solid technical performance, it sticks in my mind as one of the better worlds I’ve explored with a friend lately. "
40,F1 Manager 2023 ,8.0,"F1 Manager 2023 takes all the excitement of a race weekend and shifts the focus to behind the pit wall. If you’re a fan of the Codemasters F1 games, you know how stressful the tight turns on some of these street circuits are. I can't tell you how many times a qualifying lap has been ruined by a ""light touch"" of the wall at Monaco. In F1 Manager, that's not my problem; my only job is to tell the driver to watch their tires, fuel consumption, and about a dozen other metrics – on not just one F1 car, but two. F1 Manager 2023 fixes minor mistakes from the series debut last year and adds new ways to play, and it remains a compelling motorsports management simulation that’s committed to helping you grow both your knowledge and love of the sport. Juggling multiple metrics and managing a pair of the most elite race cars on the planet may sound overwhelming on paper but, in practice, everything feels like an opportunity to learn. And to help you learn, F1 Manager 2023 adds a brand new scenario mode called Race Replay. Race Replay features both full race replays and team-specific objectives for each track. The first moment I tried was a moment at Silverstone that required me to push both McLaren cars up to the podium after a yellow flag restart. It was the very first thing I played, so I was still trying to get my bearings. Despite the text of the challenge telling me that Norris needed to pit, I waited for about half a lap for Norris to suggest the pit stop himself. This resulted in him taking longer to get into the pits, but there was also a pit stop error – which resulted in Norris dropping to 10th position and causing me to fail the challenge. When I restarted, this time I immediately told him to pit as soon as the game let me. On this occasion there was no pit stop error and Norris held track position in fourth, making it very easy for him to overtake and win the challenge.  It’s this ability to A-B test your own actions that makes me feel like F1 Manager 2023 genuinely wants to teach the value of confident decision making and how crucial that is to becoming a world champion constructor. This ethos is the thing that shines brightest in F1 Manager, and is so inviting that I often find myself wanting to play Race Replay more often than the flagship career mode. If any of this sounds interesting, the deluxe edition of F1 Manager 2023 includes 14 additional race moments, including a scenario at the brand-new Las Vegas Grand Prix if you’re itching to see how it drives without simming most of a career season. That career mode allows you to take control of any of the ten teams on the grid and manage everything a team principal would. You have the ability to design car parts, build or upgrade team facilities, and manage the staff and drivers that work under you. You can even micromanage your pit crew and have them run drills as a unit to help cut down on errors and make them faster. All of these decisions end up producing confidence from your Board of Directors. Keep them happy, and you can manage your millions as you see fit – but if you’re unable to meet their demands, you may see yourself getting walking papers rather quickly. Which team you decide to manage will determine a lot about how detail oriented you need to be. Red Bull is not only flush with cash, but regularly cleans up race after race; even if you automate an entire weekend, they will do fine. This means that they can afford to take a long-term approach and aim for a locked-up championship at the halfway point of the season. Meanwhile, at the other end of the paddock, you have a team like Alpha Tauri (which, despite having good drivers, just has an outright lousy car). This means that they need to scrap and claw every weekend just to make it out of the first qualifying session. It’s this wide spectrum of challenge that makes F1 Manager stand out. Even if you manage to have a perfect relationship with your board and amass millions thanks to your sponsors, you’ll eventually run into the Cost Cap. The Cost Cap is a rule put in place so that teams can’t just dump billions into their teams. While it helps promote fairness, as each season has gotten longer and longer, even the top dogs like Red Bull and Mercedes have to be careful not to just burn through car parts. It means that in F1 Manager 2023, you always have to be making decisions. Sure, you can decide to save your money now and not upgrade your car parts, but that might cost you three races down the line. F1 Manager 2023 also makes sure to keep its authenticity intact by adding the two new tracks that were added to the 2023 calendar, as well as the sprint weekend format for six race weekends. These two simple additions make the strategy layer of career mode entirely different from last year. Sprint weekends forgo a practice session in order to run a shorter-distance race on Saturday for a crack at more constructor points. While it’s caused heated debate among F1 fans, it’s a perfect example of what makes F1 Manager stand out: it’s an opportunity to collect data and feel comfortable. F1 Manager also goes an additional step further than its Codemasters cousin by including not just F2 drivers but F3 as well. That said, drivers from these feeder categories were also available in F1 Manager 2022; I’d actually love to see this fleshed out more by letting you create custom drivers that you can sign and build from the ground up. Once you’re ready for a race weekend, you have three main mechanics to push the pace of your cars on track. Asking your driver to increase the heat on your tires will cause them to speed up, at the cost of literally burning rubber. Run your tires too long and too hard and you’ll turn a two-stop race into a three-stop race and likely force your driver and team out of the points. Managing your tires throughout an entire weekend can be difficult if you aren’t careful. Certain tracks are harder on tires than others; if you use up most of your soft tires in practice or qualifying, you might get stuck starting the race on a worn set. It’s an authentic juggling act. Fuel is a bit more straightforward. Ask the driver to keep his foot on the accelerator, and he’ll also have to hammer on the brake, thus burning more fuel. Because refueling is banned in F1, if you run out of fuel, you literally cannot finish a race. Once a race gets going, you have the ability to look at six different onboard cameras at low speed and a seventh camera that zooms all the way out and shows the entire track. This is the mandatory view if you choose to go any faster than 2x speed. You can go as fast as 16x speed. Be careful about using the first-person cameras at 2x speed; while I’ve never had any issue with motion sickness before, spending too much time at 2x forced me to stop playing for the night. I doubt it will be an issue for everyone, but it's something to keep an eye on. The Energy Recovery System (ERS) is the internal battery of the car that charges the engine and is, for me, the toughest part of the on-track mechanics to master. While F1 Manager 2023 thankfully doesn’t let you shoot yourself in the foot by draining the battery completely and shutting down the car, it does force you to go back to 1x speed when you hit zero. You can also give your individual drivers some very basic commands to shape their on-track behavior. While your AI drivers can do a decent enough job of overtaking and defending themselves, mastering when to issue these commands yourself can help you avoid getting stuck in the middle or back of the pack. However, it's slightly disappointing that there’s no way to design full team plans, like telling your A driver to swap positions with the B driver because the B driver has better pace. Drivers don’t have a relationship with each other but are simply there to take instructions. It stands out because team orders are a divisive but common facet of F1 authenticity, and it’s something missing from F1 Manager 2023. I hope it’s something Frontier can improve on in future games. Management games have always had a bit of difficulty deciding how to present themselves. Doubling down on intricate systems often means that developers can’t invest as much in stunning visual quality as their traditional sports game cousins. While it’s true that graphics aren’t necessarily at the forefront of Frontier’s focus, F1 Manager 2023 nonetheless looks pleasant in motion. That said, the studio’s level of achievements with this year’s audio is extremely commendable. Getting to hear real pit wall audio from the drivers is an absolute joy. Hearing my favorite driver, Yuki Tsunoda, swear at me after he dropped back to last place genuinely made me cackle – and took the sting out of a race weekend that was otherwise a failure. F1 Manager 2023 proves that Frontier isn’t one and done; it’s a championship contender. Race Replay is an absolute show stealer, and there’s nothing better than solving the strategic puzzle laid out for you in a single go. F1 Manager 2023 is as enjoyable to listen to at normal speed as it is to play, and although you can rush at 16x speed for an entire season in an afternoon if you want, it’s far more relaxing to treat it like an actual race and just chill out and watch. F1 Manager 2023 is a deep sports management experience that understands that racing can be a sport everyone can enjoy and, if you enjoy any type of management game at all, you should consider adding this to your collection.

41,Disney Illusion Island ,7.0,"With the cost of living going up and the quality of superhero movies going down, it feels like we could probably all use a cuddle right now. Disney Illusion Island seems to sense this, because this co-operative platforming adventure for up to four players features a dedicated hug button to give your partner an instant health boost whenever they’re struggling to go on. It’s an endearing bit of mouse-to-mouse resuscitation, and it’s just one of a handful of examples of kindhearted collaboration that helps to make Disney Illusion Island approachable to players of almost every age and aptitude level. There are certainly more innovative modern Metroidvanias on the market as far as level design and boss encounters are concerned but, on the strength of its warm and fuzzy feel-good factor alone, Disney Illusion Island is worth throwing your arms around. Its whimsical charm is evident from the outset. Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy arrive on the mysterious island of Monoth intending to indulge in a picnic, but are soon tasked with retrieving three magical tomes that have been stolen from the island’s library and spirited away to three interconnected biomes that make up Monoth’s vivid 2D landscape. Disney Illusion Island’s adventure is presented in a classical, hand-drawn art style that recalls the House of Mouse’s earliest forms of animation, but its irreverent and self-aware sense of humour feels noticeably more contemporary in tone. Although most of the interactions with the eccentric cast of island locals you meet along the way is purely text-based outside of a handful of major cutscenes, Disney Illusion Island still managed to elicit regular chuckles from my son and I as we breezed along through its ever-expanding world and busily ticked off its growing list of upbeat story quests.  While its map eventually becomes a sizable rabbit warren – or perhaps mouse hole – of 2D tunnels that spiral out in all directions, Disney Illusion Island is not the kind of Metroidvania that expects you to get stuck for long. Checkpoints are generously staggered, directions to specific areas are clearly marked with in-game signposts, and there are even some handy teleportation devices at several story junctions that allow you to skip return trips entirely in order to beam Mickey and the gang directly to the next mission marker. As a result, while the story took me around six hours to complete, very little of that time was wasted retracing my steps or getting confused about where to head next. It makes for a journey that maintains a strong sense of forward momentum to match the fluid set of movements of its four main characters. Each member of Disney Illusion Island’s quirky quartet is indeed a joy to steer around, with a simple and responsive set of inputs and just the right amount of floatiness to allow for split-second corrections in midair. New abilities are unlocked at regular intervals in order to gain access to previously gated areas, from wall jumps to earth-shattering ground pounds and grappling hook swings. While there’s nothing here that hasn’t been seen elsewhere in the platforming genre many times over (you can even pull off a Mario-style side-flip when you reverse direction just before a jump), it’s all implemented so smoothly that performing a series of leaps, swings, and slides in quick succession often had me feeling higher than the pitch of Mickey’s voice. All of the four playable characters feature the same expanded moveset – presumably to cutdown on squabbling at the character selection screen – but I appreciated the uniquely entertaining ways in which they’re presented; Mickey’s glide move sees him whip out a pedal-powered gyro-copter to slowly drift down to earth, while food-obsessed Goofy pulls out a giant bottle of mustard to slow his descent with a spluttering squirt. To be clear, none of these unlockable abilities are combat-based. Although Disney Illusion Island is home to a rogue’s gallery of ill-tempered ‘toons ready to trip you up at every turn, each and every one of them is to be carefully avoided since you’re not even equipped with a basic butt-stomp to fight back with – which is possibly for the best due to the fact that most of the enemies have spiky exteriors and Donald Duck still stubbornly refuses to wear pants. That said, there are still a handful of boss encounters, but they put the emphasis on passive platforming rather than direct assaults. In one you have to hop between a shuffling sequence of buttons to trigger the drop of giant capsule toys onto the head of a robotic thief, while in another you must grapple and swing off a number of perches in order to shake acorns loose that crash down onto a feathered foe. If those two examples sound somewhat similar, it’s because they very much are, and I wish developer Dlala Studios had channeled a little more creativity into these showdowns because Disney Illusion Island’s boss fights feel more like one-dimensional, paint-by-numbers contests rather than full-on Fantasia-style spectacles. Its cooperative play, though, is truly commendable – particularly if you have a balance of experienced players with more novice adventurers on the couch. Aside from hugging it out anytime you need an extra heart added to your health bar – which never stops being both useful and utterly adorable – Disney Illusion Island equips each player with additional methods of assistance to ensure that no mouse, pantsless duck or pants-wearing dog gets left behind. If another player is struggling to reach a platform higher up, you can drop a rope down to give them a shortcut. If they’re too intimidated to swim through a swirling school of enemy fish in one of the underwater passages, you can drop a marker and teleport them directly to safety. Seasoned platforming fans might ignore these sweet-natured support measures entirely, but they’re invaluable in ensuring the weakest link in your co-op chain is rarely forced to suffer or sit out for stretches of time simply because they died too soon.  Of course, Disney Illusion Island can also be played solo if you choose, and it’s certainly the most effective way to experience the adventure if you’re after any form of challenge, particularly towards the story’s end where constant prickly surfaces and waves of projectiles put your platforming reflexes to the test. On your own there’s no way to skip obstacles, and extra hearts need to be sought out and collected in the world rather than coaxed out of a co-op partner with a cuddle. However, checkpoints remain abundant and even during its most taxing passages of level design this is still relatively gentle stuff for the genre, with wide timing windows for wall jumps and grappling hook throws that are practically magnetic. If Super Meat Boy is close to the pinnacle of punitive platforming experiences, then Disney Illusion Island is positively vegan by comparison. While I did play chunks of the adventure on my own, I certainly had a much better time of it with my son riding shotgun. The Glimt you collect – an analogue for Mario’s coins or Sonic’s rings – contributes to the one pool rather than individual purses, so there’s no real reward for whoever can hoover them up first. However we still found ways to indulge in a bit of friendly rivalry. One of the best examples of this are the selfies you can take with Mickey symbols hidden throughout the world. It quickly became a competitive game within a game for one of us to find one before the other, not unlike trying to be the first to spot a certain colour of car on the highway during a family road trip. It did strike me as being a little cumbersome that I was forced to quit out to the main menu and then restart at a checkpoint any time my son wanted to join or leave my game, though. For a 2023 multiplayer platformer, no drop-in drop-out feels like a bit of a co-op cop-out. Glimt, which can be invested in permanently increasing the number of hearts for each player, is not the only collectible to be found in Disney Illusion Island. While progress through its main quest may be heavy on handholding, there’s still some joy of discovery to be found poking through suspect walls that reveal numerous hidden secrets, including mementos from Mickey’s most famous appearances on screens both silver and small. I rolled credits on the story at only 70% total completion, and I’ve since spent a couple of hours trying to seek out all the character cards and memorabilia I missed. While I’ve enjoyed the extra time spent in Disney Illusion Island’s vibrant cartoon kingdom, the more I explore it the more I lament the absence of a mini-map in its HUD. It’s somewhat of a shame to stall your smooth platforming motion from one corner of the map to the other simply because you have to constantly pause and un-pause the game to consult the full map at each fork in the path. I expected a mini-map, but all I got was a Minnie Mouse. Disney Illusion Island’s platforming may be extremely polished but it’s not particularly inventive, and nor is it likely to appeal to anyone who favours a more combat-oriented Metroidvania experience – its enemies are strictly for dodging rather than destroying, and its small assortment of boss fights are mostly anticlimactic. Where it excels, though, is in providing a wholesome co-operative journey through a charismatic cartoon world that’s well-suited to pairings of parents and their children, or perhaps older and younger siblings. It effectively gives every member of the party the means to happily bound along on the ride without ever being made to feel like a burden. If you’re after a frictionless, family-friendly platforming adventure that’s heavy on charm and light on challenge, then Disney Illusion Island fits the bill better than a muzzle on Donald Duck. "
42,mnant 2 ,9.0,"When you look back at the history of new games and their sequels, oftentimes it’s not until the second attempt at a bold new idea that things really hit their stride. Following in the footsteps of breakthrough sequels like Borderlands 2 and Assassin’s Creed 2 before it, Remnant 2 iterates on the original to phenomenal effect. Combat is even smoother and more satisfying, loot and buildcrafting have been greatly improved to allow for countless possibilities and reasons to grind, boss fights have been completely overhauled to ditch spongy bosses aided by endless waves of minions, and each of the realms feel diverse and brimming with things to do and secrets to uncover. But procedurally generated, impressively replayable levels remain its killer feature, and here they have been improved in so many ways that it's alarmingly easy to lose half a day by jumping back into the same area just to see other possibilities. We don’t have to wait for the next one: when it comes to games, the second time’s the charm.   Back in 2019 a lot of us, myself included, lovingly referred to the original Remnant: From The Ashes as “Dark Souls with guns,” and the sequel seems to nod in violent agreement with that characterization. You and up to two allies will navigate gloriously hazardous areas packed with devilish enemies who make short work of anyone without the skill or patience to overcome its intentionally challenging levels. All the familiar soulslike ideas are present and accounted for, from limited-use healing items to enemies who respawn whenever you rest at a checkpoint, but like the first game, Remnant 2 doesn’t content itself with throwing a science-fiction skin onto a tried-and-true formula. Instead, it expertly blends the best parts of fellow co-op looter shooters like Borderlands and Outriders, including an extraordinarily deep loot grind and buildcrafting, and adds plenty of interesting twists that are all its own, like procedurally generated levels and a strong set of diverse worlds for you and your teammates to jump between. The result is a unique hodgepodge of great ideas that go together like peanut butter and chocolate, but with a whole lot more shooting monsters in the face and getting murdered by blobs of sentient meat. What’s not to love? Just like its predecessor, the surreal story has you playing as a nameless survivor in a post-apocalyptic Earth where a race of evil trees called The Root are attempting to take over the multiverse. Super weird, right? That setup is mostly used to justify you teleporting to different realities to do really awesome looter-shooter stuff and save the day, but it only ever becomes slightly more interesting than that one-sentence premise. You get to chat with new and returning characters at your base, Ward 13, (most of whom have a lot to say while giving you as little actual information as possible), learn more about The Root and what’s going on with the multiversal war, and eventually come to a dramatic conclusion that’s immediately reversed so that you can continue playing without dealing with the consequences of the finale. It’s not that the writing is bad – in fact, some of it is quite good and there’s definitely some interesting concepts at play here that the community will doubtless be crafting theories about in the weeks and months ahead – it’s just that very little of that has any impact on your blank slate of a character, and it’s all so high-concept it often doesn’t gel with an adventure that’s so squarely focused on shooting alien lobsters in the thorax. The good news is that the different worlds you travel to on your journey contain bite-sized stories of their own, which are expertly told and far more compelling than your main quest. You might find yourself in a high-fantasy world of elves trying to solve a murder mystery, or aboard a starship helping a huge Gundam Wing-looking robot recover his lost cargo. Not only are those stories better, but you also spend the vast majority of your time in those worlds resolving them rather than concerning yourself with the main story. It’s just a shame that anytime I was back on Earth or dealing with the primary conflict my eyes glossed over while I listened to rambling from characters I felt I barely knew at all.  No matter which stretch of the adventure you’re working your way through, though, every second of its challenging gunplay is a total blast. Every new area is a dramatic dance of shooting, dodging, making clever use of abilities, and doing your best to not get surrounded by whatever relentless enemy is trying their best to maim and dismember you. What starts as a relatively simple toolbox containing a primary and secondary weapon, something to swing in melee combat, and a single archetype skill quickly spirals into a treasure trove of weapons, armor, highly customizable character classes, and mods that hasn’t come close to feeling stale after my first few dozen hours. A major part of what makes combat continuously feel so fresh is that you keep hopping between different worlds in the multiverse, each with their own distinct feel and new enemies to battle. One of them, N’Erud, is a sci-fiction reality filled with violent robots, electronic gizmos, and laser guns, while Losomn is a fantasy realm with cockney elves who wear bowler hats and try to cut your throat in between what I can only assume are their busy chimney-sweeping schedules. The worlds are so starkly distinct that sometimes I could hardly believe I was still in the same game I’d been playing just minutes prior. It's quite jarring – in a good way that makes each transition between them memorable – to go from battling stone golems in a multiversal labyrinth to hunting beasties in a lush, primordial forest, and the novelty of that hasn’t gotten old one bit. It certainly helps that every area is jam-packed with optional quests to tackle, secret areas to explore, and an extremely surprising number of legitimately challenging puzzles to noodle on.  Really, the only thing that nags at me about combat is that, despite there being a handful of very different worlds to explore, most of them only have a handful of unique enemy types to fight, so you end up fighting a lot of the same brand of baddies all in a row. It’s not that enemy diversity is weak overall, because taken as a whole there are probably more types in Remnant 2 than in most games, but since they’re divided among so many worlds and you typically spend about five or six hours at a stretch going through each one, I did get a tad bit tired of seeing the same group of flying gargoyles and armored knights in the world of Losomn for so long. However, moving on to the next area quickly washes away any would-be monotony. Each world also includes, as you’d expect, a bunch of boss battles, and this is one of those areas where you can tell that the developers listened to community feedback about the first Remnant’s boss fights lacking any real personality. Often they’d pit you against a forgettable enemy and then throw massive amounts of henchmen at you to artificially inflate the encounter’s difficulty. I’m extremely happy to report that Remnant 2 has not only corrected this weakness, but now counts its boss fights as one of its main strengths. Remnant: From the Ashes delivers a beautifully deranged vision of the apocalypse overflowing with twisted creatures hellbent on making you suffer. The thrill of finally beating a boss that’s had your number for hours is right up there with the Souls games that so clearly inspired it, though the underwhelming gear system sometimes brings down the high of overcoming the frequent difficulty spikes. Overall it’s a solid game that offers one of the best and most rewarding co-op experiences in quite some time, as long as you have a hint of desire to challenge and punish yourself over and over. While there are certainly some uninspired fights, like a random lady who throws Molotov cocktails at you and a blob monster who’s just a beefier version of an existing enemy you see a lot already, the vast majority are not only delightfully difficult tests of your skill and your character’s build, but also have plenty of interesting mechanics. There’s one fight where looking at the boss for a few seconds makes your character go mad and die so you have to quickly turn your back while you compose yourself, and another where a ghost traps you in a haunted house and pops out of the walls to scratch your face off. My personal favorite is an unforgettable encounter where you become trapped in a maze and have to physically fight the labyrinth itself as you navigate it and avoid getting crushed by giant cubes. In fact, that encounter might be my new favorite boss fight in any game, period – it’s that good. In order to stay ahead of the increasingly powerful enemies and boss fights that Remnant 2 has in store, you’ll need to spend a lot of time gleefully optimizing your build. The most significant and exciting decision you’ll make – and then constantly iterate upon – is your archetype (aka your class). At the start you’ll pick from four core archetypes including a support-focused Medic, a badass close-quarters tank called the Challenger, a long-range sniper and scout called the Hunter, and the Handler, which gives you an extremely useful dog companion. The Hunter, for example, has an ability that highlights all enemies on the battlefield and a passive perk that makes critical hits extend the duration of any skills they’ve got equipped, while the Challenger can do an area-of-effect war stomp at enemies in front of them and automatically gets back up after taking fatal damage. Leveling up your archetype unlocks new possibilities too, from perks that affect you and any teammates in your group, to bonuses that trigger for a limited time after you use your relic – your consumable healing item that’s the equivalent to Elden Ring’s Flask of Crimson Tears.  Remnant 2 sagely allows you to switch archetypes at will, so you’re free to experiment and level up every role on a single character instead of restarting from scratch. But the real fun comes once you unlock the ability to simultaneously equip a second archetype in the middle of the campaign; this opens up a whole new world of possibilities. Equipping The Handler and The Hunter at the same time, for example, has some great synergy where you can direct your furry ally to distract and obstruct the enemy while you pick them off with a sniper from a distance. Better still, there are an unknown amount of other archetypes you can unlock by completing specific quests hidden throughout the fractured worlds you’ll journey through. In one area, I made an offering to a secret vendor that granted me the fantastic Summoner archetype, turning me into a monster summoning witch. In another, I tracked down an elusive enemy that gave me the consumable-focused Alchemist archetype, which allowed me to use powerful thrown concoctions to control the battlefield. It took me a dozen hours of hunting just to find the handful of archetypes I discovered and there are undoubtedly plenty I still haven’t found, and searching for these awesome game-changers has me practically foaming at the mouth.  Beyond archetypes, there’s an absolute ton of weapons, rings, amulets, and armor to round out your build, and half a dozen ways you can further modify and upgrade your equipment to your exact liking. It’s a veritable buildcrafter’s Shangri-La, and with most of the equipment being hidden throughout the world (including many that are locked behind obscure secret puzzles and quests) and others that drop from powerful enemies, there’s always a reason to get back out there and explore. All of this combines into some of the most spellbinding combat I’ve seen in a looter-shooter in a long time, and I spent way too many hours just experimenting with different permutations of my loadout and hunting for new tools to add to my collection. In fact, I somehow have more than 80 rings so far – and I get the sense I’m not even close to finding them all!  There is one major disappointment in Remnant 2’s buildcrafting, however, and that’s in the quite underwhelming armor. While there are plenty of sets to find or purchase from vendors, there aren’t any ways to improve or customize armor in the same way you can with weapons, mods, and practically every other facet. It’s an especially surprising omission considering Remnant: From The Ashes has an armor upgrading system that allows you to invest in your favorite sets and improve your resistances and armor. I miss that. While it only took me 20 hours to “complete” Remnant 2, that’s only the beginning of the time I’ll actually spend playing it. One of this series’ characteristics – virtually unique within its genre – is its procedurally generated levels, storylines, and sidequests that make each run feel different. It’s both impressively unpredictable and so well organized that you could play through all of Remnant 2 without knowing that anything wasn’t hand-built… right up until you talk to your friend about your respective playthroughs and almost immediately realize that you aren’t playing the same campaign. You’ll almost certainly end up in different worlds in a different order, fight different bosses, and find completely different quests. That’s possible because every world contains two possible storylines and various other permutations along the way. This isn’t just a matter of rooms being haphazardly stitched together to add minimal diversity in lieu of unique content – the differences between each run can be so dramatic they hardly even feel like they’re part of the same world.   In one playthrough of a realm called Yaesha, I spent almost the entire time indoors traipsing through dark corridors full of crazed cultists, while on another I found myself in dense woods with a blood-red moon looming overhead, and in another still I was lost amid a maze of hovering platforms, surrounded by floating aliens who bombarded me with plasma projectiles. In one run of the fantasy world Losomn, I spent my entire run among the slums and sewers of that world’s lower class, fighting off vandals and ne’er-do-wells; in another I spent most of my time in the gilded palaces of the noble elites, fighting winged angels and armored paladins. They’re almost entirely different.  You don’t have to start a new campaign to experience them, though. After you’ve beaten the final boss on your first playthrough of any given world you can immediately and infinitely reroll that area any time you want, generating new possibilities and a fresh set of quests to complete along with it. At a minimum, you’d need to run through each world two times just to see all the major stuff. And even if you manage to get some of the same sidequests multiple times, as I sometimes did, you can make a different decision at the end to see what would have happened (and which rewards you would gain) had you let things go the other way. I don’t know that I’ve ever seen a more effective and creative use of procedural generation before, and the near-perfect execution in that regard makes Remnant 2 ridiculously replayable.  Speaking of different worlds, since this is a cooperative multiplayer game you can hop into one of your friends' worlds to help them out, gain XP, and share in their rewards, and see how different their worlds are from yours. Playing in co-op is an expectedly good time, though it does come with worse performance than in solo play (playing on PC I saw more frequent framerate hitches and occasional disconnects) and some questionable enemy scaling that can make combat less welcoming to groups. It’s a bit of a bummer, for example, that I was breezing through one area in solo play, then got utterly hammered when I invited two of my lower-level friends to join me. Whatever level adjusting happens behind the scenes at least ensures lower-level players won’t immediately get torn apart when joining a higher-level player, but it definitely makes it much harder for the whole group to succeed by bumping up enemy health and damage output by a whole heck of a lot. You’d think with drop-in/drop-out co-op, a game would want to welcome newcomers to join their friends and with the current damage scaling it makes them more likely to just get frustrated and leave. (Also, it’s worth noting that Remnant 2 does not currently support cross-play between PC, PlayStation, and Xbox versions.) It’s astounding to think that if I were to create a list of my favorite soulslikes, my favorite looter shooters, and my favorite procedurally generated games, Remnant 2 would appear on all of those lists. This is a triumphant sequel that doesn’t just reimagine the soulslike genre as a co-op looter-shooter, but absolutely nails that concept in nearly every way – including many that the original did not. With completely engrossing combat, challenging and memorable boss fights, ultra-dense buildcrafting options, incredibly cool procedurally generated levels, and a clever multiversal concept that allows for a ton of different adventures in one package, it’s very likely going to become one of my most-played games this year. No matter which part of the multiverse you find yourself in, you should do yourself a favor and play this gem. "
43,Pikmin 4 ,9.0,"Ever since the original Pikmin sprouted up out of nowhere on the GameCube, this oddball puzzle-strategy series has always held a special place in my heart – but when I played Pikmin 4, my heart grew two sizes that day. While the earliest hours started out slower than I would have liked, it reminded me of an onion – in the best kind of way – in that every layer I peeled back added more and more depth, eventually growing into the best version of the idea at the heart of it. Not all of it is as challenging as I’d have liked, but with twice as many enemy types and nearly four times the amount of hidden treasures I loved gathering in past games – along with its fantastic musical score, improved graphics, and next-level post-game content – I just couldn’t put it down until finishing everything it had to offer. Right from the very start, there’s a series first: While previous games have starred fan-favorite heroes such as Olimar and Louie, Pikmin 4 allows you to customize your character’s hair, body type, and suit color. Though it’s not the most spectacular character creator next to something like Street Fighter 6, it’s a nice touch as your color choices apply to your ship and everybody in your space crew as well.  However, I spent far more time taking in the beautiful worlds of Pikmin 4 than checking out my own character. Pikmin 4 continues the series’ tradition of playing as an alien the size of an ant exploring an Earth-like planet that is probably actually Earth. Charmingly most of the treasures you end up collecting are named after their appearance, so “Space Spinners” and “the Stone of Advancement” are really just fidget spinners and a Game Boy Advance SP. Thanks to all of the Pikmin games being made available on the Switch, it made it very easy to see just how far the series has come. Pikmin may not be as popular as Nintendo’s other biggest names, but what it often lacks in mainstream popularity is the intensity that some fans have for the series including renting out ad space on a billboard in Times Square to promote it. Everything from the soil on the ground to the foliage everywhere on the maps is vibrant, and each location feels distinct. A simple garden filled with (literally) larger-than-life insects and flowers that tower over you is filled with obstacles like a broken potted plant that blocks a passage and a puddle in the dirt that becomes a small lake. A sandy beach reveals new paths to navigate and enemies to battle after the tide recedes, and a house with multiple sets of stairs becomes mountainlike until you find a way to create ramps so your tiny followers can recover the treasures hidden inside. Much of the fun and strategy of Pikmin games comes from collecting and commanding different types of obedient little plant creatures to do your bidding, and generally avoiding sending them to their doom. It’s not a full-on real-time strategy game like StarCraft, since there’s no base-building and outside of the newly added night missions you don’t have to worry about an enemy army attacking you back, but there’s always a lot happening on screen when you have dozens of these multicolored minions doing things like digging tunnels and carrying treasures and you’re literally hurling them into combat.  For those jumping into Pikmin for the first time, it can seem like a lot, especially with nine types of cutesy creatures to master, having to split your attention between multiple objectives, and learning to manage your resources. To its great credit, Pikmin 4 does a gentle job of rolling out new Pikmin, items, and abilities at a pace that won’t overwhelm with too many options too soon. Your first steps onto this world come with a large number of tutorials and explanations – though someone like myself, who has been playing Pikmin games for 22 years, may not be able to skip the dialogue fast enough because it rarely covers anything we don’t already know. One of the most immediately noticeable differences between Pikmin 4 and its predecessors is that here there’s no limit to the number of days you have to finish the story like in the original, nor is there any threat of running out of supplies like in Pikmin 3, making it more of a casual rescue mission than a race against the clock. This decision is especially great for newcomers because it removes the pressure or worry of doing something wrong and being punished for the rest of your playthrough, but I enjoyed it too because it allowed me to tackle objectives in any order I liked and fulfill my inner need to see that 100% completion on each stage. It’s comparable to how Dead Rising removed its time limit in the fourth game in recognition of the fact that, more often than not, people play games to escape from the tension of impending deadlines that haunt us in school or work. Even without a lot of time pressure, mistakes will still happen: maybe you’ll misjudge an enemy attack range and become frozen, allowing a nearby enemy to crush or devour your Pikmin before you can react, or maybe you’ll just accidentally chuck a few Pikmin off the map while you were trying to toss them at a piece of treasure hanging from a spiderweb to weight it down and break the web so you can bring it back to your ship. In previous games careless errors like these would’ve meant spending precious time replenishing Pikmin before you can progress, but in Pikmin 4 we get a handy feature that can bail you out: Until you finish the current day, you can choose to rewind and replay parts of a level to improve your efficiency. It’s effectively a method of quickly reloading a checkpoint save, and as a perfectionist at heart, I found myself taking advantage of this system constantly in order to maximize my efficiency or save my valuable purple and white Pikmin that are scarce early on. It makes much more sense to retry a section rather than spending a chunk of my time the next day replacing Pikmin I lost. The ability to rewind extends right up to the end of your expedition, which is a huge relief – if you have played Pikmin before, you are aware of how stressful it can be when that 10-second warning appears, signaling the end of the day, while you still have 60+ Pikmin carrying multiple objects from different locations. In Pikmin 4, if you are unable to gather them all before nightfall it will tell you how many you stand to lose if you choose to continue, but ask if you would like to rewind time to one of the checkpoints to try again instead. This was a huge time-saver and kept me from having to replay entire levels when I’d only messed up the home stretch. Pikmin 3 Deluxe makes an already excellent game even better and transplants it onto a console where far more people have a chance to see how good it really is. Its Side Stories and difficulty modes aren’t massive additions, but they gave me more of the already clever and fast-paced fun that made me fall in love with the original game seven years ago. And while not as flashy new missions, there are a downright impressive amount of smaller touches and quality-of-life adjustments throughout (including replacing the Wii U’s Gamepad screen with Switch-friendly controls) that make this the best the Pikmin series has ever felt. There’s plenty of reason to come back for returning players, and if you missed Pikmin 3 on the Wii U then you absolutely shouldn’t repeat that mistake here. That’s the real trick to Pikmin 4’s combat because the 110 unique enemies (including new elemental variants of returning creatures like Bulborbs and Dweevils) increase the need to adjust the composition of your army to counter them. For instance, if you try to battle a Fiery Bulblax with anything other than red Pikmin they’ll ignite and run off screaming to their doom, meanwhile the Horned Cannon Beetle kept its backside weak point hidden unless I tossed one of the larger Purple, Ice, or Rock Pikmin into its blowhole above its head. Discovering my Otachi strategy early was great because it allowed me to spend less time replacing Pikmin lost in combat and more time collecting the 239 treasures across the six locations and 22 cave sub-levels I explored. Though once I fully leveled Oatchi’s Rush ability, it never got old being able to charge through a line of enemies and see the souls of my enemies ascend into the sky. Some of those sub-levels place you inside machine structures with conveyor belts, a kid's room filled with structures made from wooden blocks, and a freezer filled with cold-emitting dry ice that will freeze most Pikmin in their tracks. Navigating these kinds of hazards never failed to put a smile on my face – though it’s a different kind of smile than the one that creeps in when I hear the cries of my loyal Pikmin that I sometimes tossed to their certain doom in order to reach my objective. There are also some very cool Easter eggs that I won’t spoil for you, other than to say you will definitely want to give a close look at the musical items. Most boss battles are saved for the lower floors of the various cave sub-levels, and while there are plenty of returning faces here we also encounter a fun handful of new ones, like the Sovereign Bulblax and the Foolix, the latter of which is a clever evolution on the Goolix from the very first Pikmin. At first he caught me off guard (making me look like a fool, appropriately) thanks to its clever disguise as a drop of nectar. Considering all the new types of enemies with elemental properties and the fact that Pikmin 4 only lets you bring out three types of Pikmin at a time, I felt encouraged to plan out my strategy for the day accordingly. Rock Pikmin are a staple of mine, as their hardy core both deals high damage when flung at bosses and prevents them from being crushed under the weight of larger enemies like the Yellow Wollywog, but I’d often switch between ice, winged, and white Pikmin when I knew I’d need to counter threats like the airborne Lesser Spotted Jellyfloat or the toxic-based Moldy Slooch. Between those and Oatchi’s list of skills, the scales usually felt tipped in my favor. You can control Oatchi directly, but I found him more helpful as Pikmin 4’s method of splitting up your party so you can tackle more objectives simultaneously. From the map screen you can give him commands to find treasures, lost team members, and specific Pikmin types while you take care of tasks on the other side of the map. This gave me more options in general: while exploring the Serene Shores level, I would send Oatchi and Blue Pikmin to locations only accessible to them. At the same time, I took an army of Yellow and Red Pikmin across the beach, defeating enemies and digging up buried treasure.  Getting the hang of this multitasking is a necessity to earn the best rewards in some of the later challenges.   This leads me to a minor gripe about how co-op works in Pikmin 4. Unlike Pikmin 2 or 3, where a second player could take control of another character and the two of you could split up to help reduce the time it took to find everything on a stage, Pikmin 4 instead has your co-op partner play as a reticle floating around the screen that can throw pebbles to move objects or hit enemies as your character does his usual thing. I would consider it more of an assist mode, like what we saw in Super Mario Galaxy, rather than an actual co-op mode. That’s a bit of a letdown for anyone wanting to play through with a friend or significant other like we did in the previous games, but I imagine it will be great for allowing kids to help out a parent or older sibling – or vice versa. As for the two new Pikmin types, the first you’ll encounter are ice Pikmin, and with them comes the ability to freeze bodies of water and enemies. They quickly became one of my favorites thanks to their freezing effect, which works in tandem with Oatchi’s stun and allows you to chain status effects on enemies big and small – instead of spending time defeating enemies, you can just freeze them for long enough to get in and out. They are also key to destroying various ice barriers, and for navigating some of the caves with freezing temperatures that slow other Pikmin down, making them a solid option in most situations. Glow Pikmin are the other new additions, but they are only really available in the regularly occurring night missions. There, you’ll trade in your real-time strategy-style gameplay for a simplistic tower defense format where you’re challenged to protect various anthill-like structures until morning (or until all enemies have been defeated) using only Glow Pikmin. The lower difficulty stages started out basic and short but soon evolved into levels with multiple points to defend from hordes of enemies, often requiring me to leave Oatchi on defense while I explored on foot to figure out the optimal routes for protecting multiple points from waves of enemies. I didn’t really care for these early on, but around the midway point of the campaign they added some new terrifying creatures and secondary points to defend, finally introducing the complexity and enemy variety I craved. As someone who seeks out challenge, I wasn’t a huge fan of one of the other additions: a set of overpowered single-use items. Alongside the standard ultra-spicy spray that temporarily boosts Pikmin performance and the bomb rocks that destroy concrete walls we get single-use items like Lightning Shock that can paralyze everything on the screen with electricity. Being able to toss bombs with homing or proximity effects kills all the tension in battles that otherwise have me frantically dashing around and flinging Pikmin to defeat enemies while keeping my little guys from being eaten or crushed. After testing them all out I felt like I had to artificially limit my use of them in most situations because they removed any need to be strategic. This, again, is great for younger players who are still learning the ropes of Pikmin, and they will surely appreciate the assistance, but since Pikmin 4 doesn’t offer any difficulty settings (like some of the previous games in the series have) they feel like too easy of a solution. The one limitation on the power of these special items is that the raw materials you use to purchase them is also tied to building bridges to give you shortcuts through levels and permanent upgrades for yourself and Oatchi. Even without using many items, sometimes I would find myself without enough raw materials to build a bridge because I spent too many on upgrades, requiring me to circle back and gather more from deeper in the level to build them.  Upgrades were my favorite use of raw materials because they include everything from boots that increase your movement speed to suits that grant elemental immunities and armor to increase your HP and Defense. While most upgrades aren’t required to finish the story there are some locations, like an entrance to one of Pikmin 4’s many sub-levels hidden in the center of a stove’s burner, which require you to have an elemental immunity for both yourself and Oatchi just to get inside. Purchasing these sorts of upgrades early on made obstacles less of an issue as I scoured the levels for more raw materials and other items, and kept me excited for the next upgrade to become available.  The story took me around 20 hours to complete, but in classic Pikmin tradition, that is less the real ending than a signal of more to come. While I can’t go into detail, I will say that the post-credits content in Pikmin 4 might just be the best the Pikmin series has ever delivered. In fact, Pikmin 4’s greatest folly is that it saves the best of its new tricks until you have completed the campaign’s first ending and seen the credits, because I would’ve liked to have dived right into all of these creative locations, met their bizarre inhabitants, and unlocked its homage to previous Pikmin games.  Beyond the story and what comes after, Pikmin 4 offers a pair of modes designed to test your aptitude at the concept of Dandori: a Japanese word for the practice of organizing tasks strategically and working effectively to execute plans. In the Dandori Challenges you must gather all the treasures in a set location with a limited number of Pikmin, and the final couple of courses buck Pikmin’s trend of being kid-friendly and are sure to test the best Pikmin players out there if they want to earn the coveted Platinum medal. Some of these took me more than a handful of attempts!  And then there’s the Dandori Battle mode, a chaotic mix of combat and gathering, and it’s an enjoyable way to challenge my multitasking skill against an opponent who wants to win just as much as I do. You can play against the AI or a friend in local multiplayer, which is nice, but it’s a shame there's no online capability. Like the three wonderfully weird mainline games before it, Pikmin 4 has once again captured my heart with its charming creatures that fearlessly follow commands regardless of their own well-being. The difficulty leans a bit too much toward the easy side, but all-new features like ability upgrades, a pair of new Pikmin, and our loyal sidekick Oatchi add some variety to the traditional gameplay by offering options other than the grab-and-throw Pikmin formula of the past. Coupled with the largest number of enemies to battle, treasures to collect, and awesome post-game content that incorporates some great callbacks to the earlier games, I’m left with not just a positive outlook on Pikmin 4, but the direction the series is heading as a whole. "
44,Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals ,7.0,"As with a lot of sequels, Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals sticks with what works. The first Oxenfree became an instant favorite because it’s a horror game about being on the edge, both literally and metaphorically. It centers on teens on the cusp of adulthood battling terrifying ghosts trapped on the boundary of reality between space and time. Those were two edges that worked extremely well together, especially with time-travel elements that make possible futures and outcomes feel more real. In some ways, Lost Signals feels familiar to the point of being somewhat repetitive, but it still goes just a bit further. You have a similar array of secrets to uncover, dialogue to engage in, and choices to make that can drastically impact the ending and the relationships you might build. The watercolor-inspired art style does a lot to make it feel like a dream, and the audio design continues to be hard-hitting. It doesn’t outdo the impact of the original, nor is it as scary, but it still finds its own way thanks to some subtle but impactful changes that come together for an emotional and surprising ride rather than a lackluster rehash.   It’s eye-opening how characters’ experiences can change so drastically just by aging them up to adults. Instead of basing a second story around teenagers, the developers at Night School created Riley and Jacob, two 30-somethings who have to figure out how to move forward into the next stage of life while battling those same stranded ghosts (and also some rebellious teens). Between that reoccurring idea, a lot of the gameplay carrying over, and the fact that Lost Signals takes place in a town that neighbors the original setting, it doesn’t take any large swings. But that doesn't stop the core story from being any more impactful. Riley and Jacob are working overnight for an environmental research group that wants to place transmitters across Camena, the coastal town where they grew up that, coincidentally, is near Edwards Island, the old military and tourist location where the first game takes place. People who played the first game already know that there’s nothing good over there, and thankfully, Lost Signals doesn’t devote too much time to re-explaining it. There are recaps, but they’re spread out over the course of the first act to get you caught up or remind you if you’ve forgotten the details since Oxenfree came out in 2016, and it’s just enough to get the characters up to speed, too. The duo quickly comes up against the antagonists — if they can be called that:  a group of teens from a mysterious religious group who are trying to reopen the portals from the first game and unleash whatever’s beyond them. Their leader is a boisterous girl named Olivia, who has readily apparent motives, and it’s frustrating at first because Riley and Jacob take way too long to realize what’s happening, but thankfully, the developers have a few tricks. What is really going on with Olivia and her friends is the big reveal, not why they’re doing it in the first place. I’m still not sure how I feel about this revelation, which simultaneously works with and against the events of the first game, but it’s enough to really change things up before the final act. Riley and Jacob are, understandably, out of their depth, and not just in regard to the ghosts. They are your typical aimless millennials with generational baggage. Riley, who is our point-of-view character, is clearly holding back a lot of intense emotions when we meet her for the first time sleeping at a quiet bus stop. She pairs neatly with Jacob, a meek but generally optimistic guy who can best be described as an airhead. A lot of the story hinges on the conversations these two have as they hike around Camena’s winding trails, and just like in the first game, you can satisfyingly control the vibes and direction of those talks. You can choose to be emotionally distant or open with Jacob; engage with his weird tangents or cut him off. They’re different takes on Riley as a character, but they all still manage to feel like things Riley would do or say, and that’s even before you learn about why she is the way she is. The same range of conversation options goes for the teens as well, who you can befriend and get on your side if you play your cards right. And their interactions are largely interesting because Riley is someone who hasn’t done the best job taking care of herself, so there’s little chance she can change the lives of some aimless kids with a few pep talks. All of this creates a dynamic that sometimes feels like it’s adults vs. teens, which can become grating during times when it’s not handled fairly or realistically. For example, while Olivia’s motivations are understandable, she came off as one-dimensional during my playthrough because she seemed to have absolutely no redeeming characteristics that would explain why people choose to follow her or support her. But I’m left wondering about her because I didn’t do a lot to make her feel heard, so maybe that could be altered in a different playthrough. However, it was obvious who I was going to relate to the most from the start. I’m around the same age as Riley and Jacob, and watching them (sometimes literally) face their baggage and potential futures hit a little too close to home. Like them – and a whole lot of other people in this part of their lives – I’m also sitting on a bit of a precipice between a present that’s not emotionally fulfilling and a potential future that I could work toward. And as somebody who also had some rough teen years, I definitely projected quite a bit on these characters. Riley is an especially relatable figure. She’s clearly closed off and always on the edge of a nervous breakdown, but it isn’t her entire personality. If you allow her, she can reveal a lot of dimension, especially as Lost Signals opens up to reveal what she’ll be experiencing in the years ahead. Just like in the first game, introducing time travel into a personal story is a great way to have characters literally face their future and have them reckon with it, and it still works well here as a way to understand what everybody is dealing with. Naturally that’s all based on personal experience; your mileage will vary with how much you relate to the characters, but their conversations feel real enough that I think most people who would consider picking up a game like Oxenfree in the first place will find something relatable. I particularly enjoyed one section where Jacob leads Riley through one-word story time (where you create a story one word at a time) as a way to distract himself from a particularly traumatic portal event. You can brush him off, but this is just one of the many moments of downtime that allow the characters to really show off who they are. The voice acting is exceptional across the board, but Elizabeth Saydah and Joe Bianco (Riley and Jacob, respectively), also imbue their characters with a lot of personality, which certainly helps with making them seem like actual people. They’re subdued, with the proper amount of “ums” and pauses to make their conversations feel real. Just like in the last one, the crux of Lost Signals is these conversations, where you can respond in one of three ways. I don’t know how many different combinations there are in Lost Signals or how many endings they amount to (there are three major ones I can spot, but it’s possible there are dozens of variations). But there are so many ways to take interactions, which you use to build relationships, which in turn have a big impact on much larger events. If you don’t forge bonds with Olivia’s followers, for example, it can lead to negative consequences when confronting her. Although depending on what kind of Riley you want to play, you might want to keep them at a distance – choices aren’t “good” or “bad,” in the traditional video game sense, so you aren’t compelled to do either except if you want to do multiple playthroughs. One where I sought out secrets and did sidequests took around eight hours, but subsequent runs will likely be shorter. And depending on your ending, you might want to immediately jump into another. After my extremely bittersweet ending, I definitely will be. Oxenfree is elegantly simple, using branching dialogue and a little something supernatural to develop three-dimensional characters and drive the coming-of-age story. There’s not much else to it in terms of gameplay, which is absolutely a good thing, but pacing issues in its story can make it feel sluggish between conversations. Mostly, though, it’s like walking through a stunning painting, listening to the idle chatter and revealing talks of (sometimes unnatural-sounding) teenagers.Beyond a whole new set of characters, the developers made other changes to Oxenfree’s template, including a larger setting. This brings more places to explore, but it also creates more empty space that you have to fill. There are quite a few places where you’ll be walking through them and nothing will happen, or you have to backtrack over trails you’ve been across a few times already with nothing new to refresh them. But thankfully, there’s enough that happens throughout the runtime that these moments don’t bog you down too much. The developers do manage to fill Lost Signals out with some new and clever ideas, the biggest being the walkie-talkie. In the first game there was only the radio, but here, there are nine channels where you can talk with other characters. Most of them are optional, but if you choose, you can reach out to a park ranger on channel 1, a fisherman on channel 5, and a high schooler running an advice radio show on channel 8 (make sure to check in on her when you get the chance). It also provides another outlet for some strange transmissions that deepen the weirdness, which is always welcome. These are all characters that feel properly fleshed out, which is impressive considering you never see any of them.  Around Camena you can also find letters from Maggie Adler, a tertiary character from the last game, and complete tasks for some of your walkie-talkie friends. Most of them don’t have a huge impact on the story, but they give you more chances to engage in decision-making, and they explain what’s happening in the wider world as the portals start to wreak more havoc. The same goes for the main story quest as well. You have to visit a few different peaks to plant the transmitters, and you can technically do them in any order. This means you’ll hit certain encounters out of what must’ve been the expected order, which in my playthrough meant a location was ransacked before I got there. It gives way more weight to your choices when even the smallest ones have immediate effects. Hiking around the island also isn’t too easy, which also helps to break up the monotony when quests send you back and forth. Camena is more mountainous than Edwards Island, so there’s a new mountain climbing mechanic. This cuts off specific areas until you get certain equipment (in classic adventure game style), which makes completing the task of placing transmitters at the highest peaks more difficult. It doesn't do a ton to change it up, but it's enough to make Camena feel distinct from Edwards Island, and it does more to fill in the emptiness of the map. It also gives Lost Signals reason to open up new areas like caves and beaches that are off the beaten path and contain secrets and important storylines.  If an area is particularly inaccessible, there’s a chance you might get to take advantage of some portals through time. These dump you out in the past and allow you to cross a bridge that might not be there anymore or use a lift that’s since collapsed. However, this isn’t used nearly enough considering how much much time the developers dedicate to teaching you how they work. These barely tapped puzzle ideas are a missed opportunity to add more to Lost Signals and separate it from its predecessor just a bit more. While the similarities with its predecessor can make Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals feel too familiar, highlighting a few missed opportunities for expansion of its puzzle mechanics and for fresh worldbuilding, it still creates an intimate but epic adventure. The world is built out just enough to feel fresh and to lead you to some unexpected and surprising places. However, its real strengths are its characters. Riley’s story is a standout, but she and Jacob come together to form a bond that carries you through to the (possibly) bitter end. The choice is yours. "
45,Everybody 1-2-Switch ,4.0,"Everybody 1-2-Switch might be the first party game I’ve played where I ended up with fewer friends afterwards – and not for any of the good reasons either, like a contentious Mario Kart match that tears friends apart. After roping numerous groups into playing with me, a few of those people aren’t returning my calls. Instead, these former companions live in fear that I’ll ask them to play again, because this game is full of bad ideas that unfortunately soured a good chunk of my holiday weekend. Sadly, Everybody 1-2-Switch is an incredibly disappointing sequel to 1-2-Switch. While its predecessor served as a tech demo – and mission statement of sorts – for a console that was breaking new ground with its controllers, this meager follow-up manages to feel like a major step backwards by hosting a slim collection of uncreative and poorly designed minigames that make shoddy use of what’s still unique about the Switch’s tech.   The idea is that two teams battle it out in a series of non sequitur minigames that have you perform competitive chores, like jumping rope or pumping up balloons, until a winner is declared. The most interesting change from the original is that now there’s a mode where you and your friends can use Apple or Android phones instead of Joy-Cons, so you don’t need to buy a ton of extra controllers to play in a group. The addition of phones does result in a few unique minigames that the Switch wouldn’t be able to do on its own, although they aren’t very entertaining more often than not. There’s one where you literally just play Bingo is a great example of how uncreative they are; this is exactly what we, the under-70 crowd, were all hoping to do on our phones at a party, right? There are a few that are mildly better though, like one where you’re shown a color on-screen then have to search your surroundings for something of a similar color and take a photo of it with your phone’s camera, with the closest match claiming victory. That at least has some novelty to it. Of course, anytime you add cell phones to the mix you can expect some odd technical roadblocks to occasionally gunk up your flow. For example, sometimes we’d get a minigame that required camera or microphone access only to find out that some of the more security conscious in our group had blocked camera access on their browser. That would give us a message saying that the minigame had been canceled because not enough of us could use a camera. Why we weren't able to just give those people an opportunity to enable cameras on their browsers before calling the whole thing off I couldn’t tell you – just don’t be surprised if you have to Google around for tech support. There’s also a more traditional Joy-Con mode that’s filled with by-the-numbers motion-controlled games, like one where you and your friends have to scoot your butts in each other’s general direction in order to bump one another out of a virtual arena. These are about as uninspired as they come, since they ask you to basically just repeat the same motions – in this case involving butts – in each one, whether it’s jumping up and down or swinging your arms to and fro. They’re also very easily exploited by unscrupulous party-goers who’d rather flick their wrist around instead of actually performing the activity – and, in many cases, those party poopers will win handily using their shady tactics. You’ll find only 17 minigames in total (compared to the last game’s 28) and yet even with that low volume many of them are not winners. There’s a samurai dueling game that’s just a carbon copy of the Quick Draw cowboy dueling from the last game, a trivial trivia game that has you answer really difficult questions like, “Is the nose used to see things?” or “What letter comes after C in the alphabet?” and another where you repeat the same motion over and over again to summon little gray aliens so that they can perform the same motion back at you and then leave. There’s certainly some novelty in the bizarre competitions you’re asked to participate in, but what precious few are fun the first time you play them definitely aren’t at all the second and third time. That just makes an already underwhelming curiosity progressively worse the longer you play it.  I’m normally a big fan of the “do this random thing” style of party games, like when Warioware asks me to tickle an old man or pick my nose or whatever, but Everybody 1-2-Switch is just a bundle of some of the least creative minigames I could imagine. Worse yet, they also happen to be terrible showcases of the Switch’s novel technology. There’s a relay race minigame that has you shaking the Joy-Con before passing it on to another player, and another where you have to listen to children order ice cream before you’re quizzed on how many scoops of each flavor were ordered. It’s crazy to me that, in a limitless creative landscape where you could dream up anything you want, you’d choose to make me perform a crummy retail job as a party game. How is that the best Nintendo could come up with in the past six years? 1-2-Switch is the Switch’s version of Wii Sports, in that it acts as an overall mission statement for the console itself. The quirky, bizarre nature of the unique mini-games make it a funny, memorable experience, but some games are hard to play at first due to unclear tutorials and dialogue cues. Despite its oddities and flaws, I have had so, so much fun playing and watching 1-2-Switch with a small group of friends that I can recommend it in that specific situation, but I don’t have much desire to go back.  After just a couple rounds, you’ll more than likely already find yourself begrudgingly forced to replay the same minigames a second or third time, since your fate is decided by a roulette wheel of options that frequently has the same minigames you just played. With irritatingly few changes to be found through repeated play, the handful of game modes becomes annoying very quickly. Usually there will be only very slight adjustments, like the squatting exercise that adds more fakeouts where the instructors say “squash” or something, but in many cases they’re somehow made even worse in their more advanced forms. For example, the auction minigame asks you to place bids much faster in its later iterations, which takes away a lot of the communication that’s encouraged in the original version and strips out most of the anticipation. Then there are others that change basically nothing at all, like the UFOs minigame that simply has you say goodbye to the aliens you greeted earlier. (More like good riddance.) Thankfully there are a few games where Everybody 1-2-Switch shines, like Joy-Con Hide and Seek, in which one player hides their controller and the other team searches for it, armed with the ability to make the hidden controller vibrate violently to aid their search. There’s also an entertaining game of musical chairs where your reaction speed is tested against your friends in a way that’s less likely to result in injury compared to the original version. It was nice to see neat pockets of creativity in an otherwise-dull collection of uninspired ideas, even if they didn’t do much to improve the group’s enthusiasm for the festivities overall.  Those bright spots certainly don’t balance the scales when so many are just poorly designed, like the ninja game where one team is meant to surround an opposing player and throw ninja stars at them while they defend with a sword. The problem is that the direction stars come from has absolutely no impact – so long as the defender swings at the right time, they’ll block whatever’s thrown their way. And because there’s a clear sound effect every time an attacker throws a ninja star, the defender can literally play with their eyes closed and it’s not even difficult. In my group, the response to this complete lack of challenge was something we started calling “going banshee mode,” where the attackers would scream at the top of their lungs throughout the entire round to make it impossible for the defender to hear the sound effects. Just as there’s no rule that a golden retriever can’t play basketball, there was nothing in the tutorial that prohibited audio interference. As hilarious as that meta was, it felt pretty awful that we were able to master and then undermine minigames so quickly. That’s not the kind of replayability games usually shoot for.  Beyond that, there’s a bunch of the usual issues with motion tracking devices not functioning well enough for competition to feel on the level. One of our Joy-Cons had connectivity issues that made a team fail a rhythm minigame, while input lag during the ice cream parlor game regularly caused losses due to people not being able to get their answer in fast enough. Anyone who’s played party games of this kind will know these certainly aren’t unique problems, but it definitely feels worse when the party favor in question was never fun to begin with. Everybody 1-2-Switch is a tedious and surprisingly small catalog of unoriginal and mostly poorly designed minigames that’s guaranteed to bring any party grinding to a halt. Even with a few interesting ideas, like Joy-Con hide and seek or the color scavenger-hunting modes, there are simply too few options to keep a group’s attention for one game, much less for multiple matches. Throw in the fact that many ideas are mind-numbingly boring, and others are rehashes of stuff found in the original, and you’ve got yourself a great way to rid yourself of unwanted friendships but not much more than that. "
46,Crash Team Rumble ,7.0,"On paper, Crash Team Rumble doesn’t seem like it should work. It’s a team-based, competitive platformer that breaks a lot of the rules we associate with other multiplayer games like it. For instance, instead of getting ahead by KOing members of the enemy team, you’re racing to collect 2,000 Wumpa Fruit before they do. But while this concoction may seem strange at a glance, it comes together in surprisingly fun fashion thanks largely to its excellent map design. After spending a week with it after launch, I can confidently say Toys for Bob’s multiplayer take on Crash Bandicoot is one unique and tasty fruit – but it only comes in the one flavor and its character balance could use some work. Rumble’s 4-on-4 matches pit teams of iconic Crash Bandicoot characters against each other. There are currently eight to choose from, each broken into one of three archetypes: Scorers: Crash, Tawna, and Catbat; Blockers: Dingodile, Dr. N. Brio, and Dr. N. Tropy; and Boosters: Coco and Dr. Neo Cortex. It’s a good starting roster – so far I’ve enjoyed playing as every character, and they all feel very different even if they come from the same archetype.  Scorers are, naturally, the best at scoring. They can hold more Wumpa Fruit at one time than the other archetypes, tend to be pretty good at fighting off enemies trying to stop them, and usually have special movement abilities that make them tough to corner. Blockers are good at blocking scorers from scoring. They can sit on the other team’s bank for a long time if played well, with strong offensive capabilities and knack for controlling the space around them. Boosters are a little less straightforward; their job is to support their team, but they do so in a couple of interesting ways. The first is by capturing groups of Gems scattered around the map by jumping on them. Wumpa Fruit may be the name of the game, but capturing Gems is essential because they provide a significant scoring boost. There’s a big difference between turning in Wumpa Fruit normally and turning them in when you control every group of Gems on the map because that means you’re doubling your score. Even capturing at an additional 30% makes a huge difference, and Boosters are custom-built for capturing fights, which can be won and lost in an instant. They excel at keeping other players away from them (or their location), but they’re not just there to capture Gems. The real game-changer is when you take your Booster – who can collect Relics more quickly than Scorers or Blockers – to the stage-specific Epic Relic Stations and cash them in for power-ups. There’s only one of these on each of the nine launch maps, and they’re more expensive than standard Relic Station upgrades that only affect your character, but the rewards are enormous. Just Beachy’s is a Bonus Bank that doubles your Wumpa turn-ins as long as it’s up. City Scrape’s summons TNT drones that chase your enemies. Serenity Gardens’ gets you a Big Bonsai, a tree full of Wumpa Fruit. Others summon dragons, spaceships, sandstorms… there’s a lot. Best of all, each one is specifically tailored to its map’s themes and design, which has helped each and every map feel unique. Matches have an interesting ebb and flow to them. They start out as races to capture as many Gems as possible and build early leads, then turn into ongoing battles over Wumpa, Relic Stations, and Gems when they pop back up again. What each team does often depends on how well the first minute or so plays out: If your team secured most of the map’s Gems, you’ll probably want to cash in your Wumpa advantage; If you didn’t, you’re probably going to need to focus on blocking the other team from scoring or building up a huge Relic cache. Even then, you have interesting choices to make: do you go all-in on the Epic Relic Station or focus on getting a lot of little ones? If the other team looks like they might snag the Epic Relic Station before you, do you try to catch up or just focus on scoring and playing defense? And how dedicated are you to fighting over the Gems when they come back up? There’s no right or wrong answer here; I’ve seen teams get steamrolled because they couldn’t capture any Gems and make huge comebacks because they focused on scoring while the other team put too much emphasis on getting Relics. It all comes down to your ability to adapt to the way the match is going at any given time, and how well you pull off your gameplan. Each match (which usually lasts about five minutes) is fun because you never know how a game will go, and you’re never truly out of it until you lose. Crash Team Rumble asks you to make a lot of important decisions on the fly during the action, but picking your team composition beforehand matters more than most because you can’t change your mind once the match starts. My go-to is Dingodile; his vacuum sucks up Wumpas and enemies from afar; his spin attack hits hard, can be charged, and holds an area well; and he’s pretty tanky, which is just my style. That said, a team of four Dongodiles probably isn’t a good idea because his mobility is limited and he can’t keep up with the Scorers in sheer Wumpa collection, so if someone else beats me to him I’d be inclined to switch to someone else. Locking in a character doesn’t mean you’re stuck doing one thing, though. Sure, Dingodile is a Blocker, but his vacuum lets him suck up Wumpa Fruit quickly and he can hold more of them than the average Blocker or Booster, so he can still score in a pinch. Crash’s speed and ability to carry a lot of Wumpa is core to being a Scorer, but he’s also handy in a fight and his Slam and Super Slam attacks work great if you’re trying to control space or KO another player – ideal for double-duty as a Booster or a Blocker. Each character is different: Tawna has a grappling hook for zooming around the map and pulling herself to enemies, Dr. N. Tropy can hover and create energy balls that knock opponents away, Coco’s shields can keep other players off of platforms, and so on. Everybody feels useful in Crash Team Rumble, which is awesome because you only start with three of them: Crash, Dingodile, and Coco. You’ll have to unlock the rest. I don’t mind unlocking characters - this system makes it easy to learn each archetype’s ins and outs without overwhelming you - but it does lead to some issues Crash Team Rumble wouldn’t have if you could just pick whoever you wanted from the jump. The problem is that some characters just seem better than others, largely because of their movement abilities in a game about staying one step ahead of the other team, and a lot of those are the ones you have to unlock. Sure, Crash can do well in just about any match, but Tawna’s grappling hook lets her move faster than Crash can dream of and she has better options in combat. Catbat can fly, heal themself and their allies, and constantly divebomb you from the air. Catbat has the lowest health of the Scorers, but low health doesn’t matter when no one can catch you or knock you off the map. The other two archetypes have the same issue. Dr. Neo Cortex is fine, but I don’t know why you would use him when Coco has better abilities and more health – unless you just really like him from previous games. There’s a reason you see Coco in almost every match – a good player can take over a game and is almost impossible to KO. Dr. Neo Cortex, on the other hand, is far rarer. This problem is most noticeable in the Blocker role, however. My beloved Dingodile struggles against characters who have great mobility, like Catbat, and Dr. N. Brio is only really strong when he transforms. The best character of the group is easily Dr. N. Tropy, who has excellent mobility, good damage, and high health – and the only check on her power is that it takes way too long to unlock her by scoring badges by scoring badges as a Blocker. Gathering 15 Scorer or Booster badges is enough to unlock the next character in the other archetypes, but unlocking Dr. N. Tropy means accumulating a whopping 50 Blocker badges, which takes forever and feels unfair given that it puts the most powerful character in the hands of only a few hardcore players. The unlock system isn’t a dealbreaker – again, every character seems viable and they’re all fun to play because of how unique they are – but it is annoying that the bar is set so high to even try out all of them. Every character also gets a Power that charges up throughout the match. They’re not character specific – you can choose from a list no matter who you’re playing as, but like characters, you can’t switch mid-match – but they can make all the difference in a close game. The Wumpa Stash builds up over time once you activate it, letting you score big when you turn in Wumpa if you can stay alive long enough. There’s also a refrigerator that will heal any allies, the Gasmoxian Guard, whose lightning pulses are great for holding areas or playing keepaway, and the Flytrap Spitter, which attacks enemies from range. My team has stolen several games because I saved my Gasmoxian Guard until the last second – it knocked the entire enemy team off our bank, allowing us to score for the win. The issue, again, is that some – like the Gasmoxian Guard, which you’ll see in literally every match – are just better than others and the unlock conditions are less than ideal. You earn them over time by turning in Relics at Relic Stations, but some require you to activate Common Relic Stations, and others need Epic Relic Stations. Because most games revolve around fighting over Epic Relic Stations, you’ll turn in a lot of those first. Unlocking the other Powers means focusing on activating Common Relic Stations, often at the expense of Relics that could be better spent on the Epic Relic Stations. So you have a choice: play the long game to unlock Powers like the Wumpa Stash, which are quite good, for use in later matches or spend your Relics in a way that’s more likely to win the game you’re in. It’s rough. What I like most about Crash Team Rumble, though, is its map design and how it forces you to use your character's skills. The maps here remind me of old-school arena shooters like Quake or Halo in that you’re always able to get to where you want to be quickly – and developing routes that maximize your Wumpa pickups, Relic collection, Gem activation, and drop-offs along the way feels as crucial to winning as knowing where and when weapons will spawn. Most surprisingly, I found that I enjoyed every single one. Usually there’s a stinker or two in any multiplayer game’s map rotation, but every map in Crash Team Rumble is distinct and fun to play. Some have a lot of tall structures and are cut into different segments, so positioning is key to winning fights. Others are flat and open, inviting all-out brawls. I prefer the more vertical maps like Surreal Summit, N. Sanity Caverns, and City Scrape, but I liked playing all of them because each requires a different strategy. Nine maps may not seem like a lot, but Toys for Bob has done a great job making colorful, creative, and memorable environments to explore in your battle for Wumpa Fruit. Naturally, there’s a Battle Pass, and each character can also be leveled up individually by completing challenges. Either way, the reward is the same: cosmetics. I’m not normally a fan of stuff like this, but Crash Team Rumble does it better than most games. It’s fun to dress Dingodile up like a hockey player, equip Tawna with a teddy bear backpack, or give Coco a cowboy hat. I’ve spent a lot of time with these characters and I enjoy going into a match knowing they’re mine, not a carbon copy of someone else’s or one of only a few skin options. I think what truly holds Crash Team Rumble back from greatness, though, is a lack of alternate game modes. There’s a tutorial, practice matches (which don’t allow you to make progress toward unlocking anything), private matches for friends, and competitive matches. That’s it. There are no other game types to fool around in and no distinction between casual and ranked play. While matchmaking is fast and going from one game to the next is a breeze, there just isn’t a lot here. Crash Team Rumble is a lot of fun, and it’s easy to get into the “just one more match” cycle that leads to staying up until three in the morning, but not even the best games can survive a lack of variety for long. Crash Team Rumble is a very tasty bite of Wumpa Fruit. I just wish it was more filling. Crash Team Rumble may not be a traditional Crash game, but it is a very fun one. Some characters and powers definitely seem to be stronger than others based on the fact that the community brings them into every single match, but everything and everyone is viable in the right hands. Matchmaking is a breeze, the maps are absolutely incredible, there’s a lot of depth for those who want to mine it, and it’s easy to lose yourself in the hunt for Wumpa Fruit for hours at a time, especially if you’re playing with friends. Even the cosmetic upgrades are fun to mess around with. But those hours come to a close a bit too soon due to a lack of game modes, limited matchmaking options, and an unlock system that is often downright annoying. That leaves Crash Team Rumble feeling a lot like Wumpa Fruit itself: it’s a great snack, and it’s got a lot of flavor, but you’ll probably be hungry again 30 minutes later. I know I was. "
47,Park Beyond ,5.0,"The magic of a park sim is its ability to make time disappear. When you are in the zone building your park, managing the wants and needs of your attendees, and creating a self-sustaining financial juggernaut, there’s potential for an almost euphoric Zen from the best of the genre. At its best, Park Beyond hits these highs with interesting rides, a simple and compelling upgrade system, and a whimsical sense of imagination. But, like a poorly maintained rollercoaster, there’s a looming threat that things will fall apart with disastrous results. It’s this tendency for things to come off the rails that left me feeling queasy after spending a few days in this park.   A game like this lives and dies by its building mechanics, and Park Beyond is pretty solid in that regard. Crafting a thriving and growing park from scratch is a lot of fun: building paths, flat rides, roller coasters, and shops is easy, thanks in part to a simple interface and controls that are straightforward when it comes to the simple stuff. After your grand opening there’s a linear, step-by-step process to upgrading and expanding your park that’s easy to understand and fun to execute. The capacity, and by extension income potential, of the park is limited at first. In the beginning there are only a few rides that can be built to entice customers. The amount of fun people have and the cleanliness of the park increases Park Appeal. Earn enough appeal and the park ranks up, increasing capacity and unlocking additional rides and shops. Which upgrades to select presents an interesting tactical choice. You can focus on obvious things, like unlocking shops to fulfill basic needs like food and drink and add some more basic ride options. Or you can be more strategic, unlocking options that appeal to a specific demographic (such as adults), or rides that prioritize fun over profitability to gamble that you can build a large base of customers quickly and then capitalize on them later. The moments when I’m clicking back and forth between different options, torn about what to select, is agonizing and engaging in the best way. The key differentiator between Park Beyond and other park sims is its fantasy concept of “impossificaiton.” As the amazement of your guests accumulates, you earn the ability to pull out a magic pencil and supercharge rides or employees. Suddenly that Shining Pendulum transforms into a colorful launcher of human-filled spinning tops, or that Ring of Fire loses the top of the arch, and launches riders from one side to the other while spinning like someone juggling on a turntable. It’s hilarious and wondrous, with a whimsical imagination that one would expect from a Roald Dahl book. I couldn’t help but smile the first time I impossified one of my janitors and he started cremating the nearby trash bins with a full on flamethrower. Some rides can even be impossified twice to become… impossibler? Each upgrade increases potential fun, amazement, and profit, but also adds to upkeep cost, and that’s unfortunately one of many areas where poor economic tuning becomes an issue for Park Beyond. Some rides become devastating financial drains after the upgrades, which turns the promise of a park filled with joyfully ludicrous machinery into a trap leading to financial ruin. Often the best long-term strategy is to play it safe with conventional rides, which can suck the soul out of these fantastical parks and reduce them to something run-of-the-mill.  That kind of oversight is unfortunately par for the course when it comes to the fiscal aspects of managing your park. Customer appeal, for instance, is unpredictable to the point of feeling random. A ride can be red hot one moment, then a money pit the next without any changes to ticket prices. Some evolution in park-goer taste over time makes sense, especially as rides age, but the wild swings from crowded to abandoned defy strategy, and mature parks have an unfortunate tendency to go from extremely positive cash flow to hemorrhaging money, seemingly in the blink of an eye and without explanation, which can be a miserable experience. What’s much more dependable are the roller coaster construction options, which should feel familiar to park sim veterans whether you’re building from scratch or selecting from prefabricated rides. Simple rail and chain lift options are enough to get a roller coaster going, and building simple rides is a breeze while more complex ones can be a challenge, as you’d expect. Unfortunately there’s an issue that crops up here as well when you get into the fancier options: there are enjoyably absurd modules that can fire cars out of cannons, or send them across open fields in giant hamster balls a la Jurassic World, but those come with the catch that getting tracks to point in the desired direction is like wrestling a fire hose. I often found myself giving up on opportunities to use the terrain in neat ways with tunnels, switchbacks, or loops, as the simple act of placing tracks became more trouble that it was worth. That stifled my more creative urges in a disappointing way. Even so, I was generally satisfied with the rides I was able to produce, but that just made the abysmal staff managing them that much more aggravating. Roles that keep your park clean and running are essential to earn income and raise your park appeal, but the people available to hire to do them operate with a terrible lack of basic sense. Is that ride shooting sparks and about to catch fire? Better fix up this seldom-used vending machine instead! Janitors will ignore heaps of litter in the streets to empty far-flung trash bins, and mechanics will ignore rides on the verge of collapse. That would be excusable if this were the kind of game where you could directly control them or manually set priorities, but no such options exist: you are fully at the mercy of the AI. The only solution is often to overstaff and hope for the best, which is a frustrating feeling when you are trying to grow your park on a shoestring budget.  Then there’s the park attendees themselves. They’re the true villains of Park Beyond, but through no fault of their own. The people you need to please and collect money from simply break at times. On several occasions I had a park that I thought was fully dialed in with great rides, plenty of food, drink, and bathroom options – earning strong metrics all around – only to have a total collapse of customer sentiment because entire crowds of people became frozen in place, unable to satisfy their basic needs or spend money at rides. Sometimes you can fix it by closing and reopening a ride, other times I had to delete chunks of my park, and in some cases I had to restart missions entirely. Eventually I just started checking every inch of my park for glitched attractions for customers every few minutes, a tedious necessity to keep things operating. That bugginess unfortunately doesn’t stop there. I’ve had immaculate parks’ scores ruined by invisible garbage, seen sidewalks disappear below ground, and entire shops lose their identity and become groups of dissociated parts. Some of these things are annoying, like employees getting stuck in the staff lounge until I delete it, and others are soul crushing, like the handful of hard crashes that undid untold amounts of focused park construction. It’s aggravating, and any large park feels like a ticking time bomb, ready to rob hours of work seemingly at random. Reverting to a manual or autosave is an option, but often introduces new bugs, and an inexplicably crashing balance sheet that had been healthy on the previous run through.  The threat of bugs dangles over you regardless of which of the two main modes you choose, but they do a good job mixing up the ways you can approach park building. First, there’s the Campaign, which throws you into eight increasingly difficult park-building scenarios, acting as a cross between a tutorial and story-driven challenge. While the story and characters are a forgettably generic group of scrappy park builders, the first few missions do a great job introducing a unique wrinkle that gives each one a different feel. One has you taking over a failing park that’s in need of your deft touch to turn it around. Another places you at the center of an archipelago, racing to earn money fast enough to buy the surrounding islands before they get turned into parking lots. It keeps things fresh and exciting, and makes for some good park-building puzzles.  The later missions, however, are a slog. The difficulty spikes considerably, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing when done well, but a slim margin of error just isn’t compatible with the unpredictable systems and unreliable tech. Rather than a triumphant culmination of all my skills, beating the last mission after about 40 hours felt more like the end of a prison sentence.  Sandbox is a much more consistent experience, and a more fun way to play. There are over two dozen maps to start with and build from. I like that you can assign yourself optional goals and starting funds, or just take unlimited money with no objectives and focus on creative freedom. This is where the whacky construction really shines, and it’s easy to lose hours (which, again, is the mark of a good park sim) to creating increasingly impossible roller coasters. It doesn’t have nearly as many customizations options as something like Planet Coaster, especially on the flat rides, but pulling the magic marker out and turning all the rides into delightful absurdities is well worth the tradeoff. Park Beyond does a great job tapping into the childhood whimsy that theme parks can elicit. There's a great sense of wonder to be had by impossifying rides, and the simple interface makes it easy to do. Incrementally unlocking new rides and increasing park capacity is rewarding, and creating something utterly ludicrous can be a blast. But that joy dissipates quickly when parks become unmanageable, as the attendees get stuck, staff ignores pressing needs, and financial ruin springs seemingly out of nowhere, while bugs and crashes make a late-campaign difficulty spike a miserable slog. Like riding an unfinished roller coaster, there’s fun to be had until the eventual crash, but it feels like this park just isn’t ready to be opened. "
48,F1 23 ,8.0,"After roughly 940 million kilometres, the Earth has reached the point on its 12-month celestial march around the sun where it’s time for another Formula 1 game. Fitting, perhaps, considering I feel like I’ve driven roughly 940 million kilometres in this series over the past decade-and-change. Jokes aside, it’s a testament to the incredible robustness of Codemasters’ brand of open-wheel motorsport magic that climbing back into the cockpit each year remains a pleasure, and F1 23 is no exception. Alongside noticeably improved handling for the new-era cars, F1 23 also adds the next chapter of the Braking Point story mode introduced in F1 2021 – plus a new reward-based progression system with daily, weekly, and seasonal goals. The result is plenty to keep us busy, even if your personal mileage may vary substantially depending on your taste in both curated, solo campaigns and live service-style game modes. Last season’s sweeping regulation changes ushered in a field full of brand-new F1 cars, and with their bigger wheels and tyres they were the best-looking cars the sport had seen in some time. However, they were also the heaviest cars in the championship’s history. In F1 22 this translated to a model that made manhandling that additional bulk quite tricky. Relearning the limits of these new cars was admittedly an absorbing challenge, but it wasn’t always a fun one; there was definitely a fickleness to the way the cars had a tendency to both understeer coming into corners and oversteer while trying to throttle out of them.  In F1 23, driveability has improved dramatically. There’s still a sensation of bulk here in the hefty new-era cars, but they feel considerably more cooperative; grippier and more stable, especially clipping kerbs. Better still, for those of you without a wheel there’s a truly excellent intuitiveness to the game pad controls this year. This was most evident to me while navigating slow corners in narrow street circuits and snapping out of early slides when getting on the throttle a little too hard. I don’t know if I’ve ever really been able to catch oversteer so effectively on a humble analogue stick in any F1 game, ever. F1 23 is easily the best the F1 series has ever felt on a traditional controller. The cars feel lively and dangerous, but they respect your commands. It’s like walking an obedient Dobermann through a butcher’s shop. Braking Point 2 is the continuation of the story Codemasters kicked off in F1 2021 and, despite the fact its 17 chapters ultimately only lasted me a few sessions over a couple of days, it’s definitely my favourite part of F1 23. For the purposes of a good yarn, Braking Point 2 adds a fictional eleventh team called Konnersport to the grid (much like we’ve been doing ourselves in My Team mode since F1 2020). The upshot here is that it seems to have resulted in a story with a bit more substance this time around. Emotion and conflict both run a little higher than I would suspect might have been possible within the bubble of an existing team with real-world sponsors. Also, while Braking Point 2 may move to a predictable enough conclusion, I was pleasantly surprised to be caught unawares by at least a couple of unexpected developments. While the original Braking Point concentrated on the chalk-and-cheese driving pair of rookie Aiden Jackson and retiring Dutch journeyman Casper Akkerman, Braking Point 2 broadens its lens. The focus here is really the whole Konnersport team, from the drivers (Jackson and his long-time nemesis Devon Butler) to likeable team principal Andreo Konner. Also in the frame is Davidoff Butler, Devon’s father and the CEO of Konnersport’s primary sponsor – plus up-and-coming F2 driver Callie Mayer, who’s being managed by Akkerman. As with the original Braking Point, the events in Braking Point 2 are a mix of scenarios with specific challenges to achieve as Jackson, Mayer, and even Devon Butler himself. Some events are full races but most are mid-race situations where you may find yourself asked to finish ahead of specific drivers or teams, salvage or defend your position after dealing with some bad luck, or capitalise on some smart strategy. Overachieving this time around can earn you bonus objectives, and doing so ranks you up within the story mode to unlock new responses to press questions and internal staff queries, but it doesn’t change the overall story – just minor side stories and conversations along the way. That said, I really like the structure; I appreciate the variety and I enjoy having goals. Make up so many spots. Don’t finish behind so-and-so. Maybe I just like being bossed around. Perhaps surprisingly considering his role in F1 2021, Jackson takes a bit of a backseat in Braking Point 2. This actually may be for the best as I found him even harder to warm to this time around, although some of that may be to do with the fact he’s still probably the least fleshed-out character. We learned very little about Jackson in the first Braking Point and we learn even less here. The spotlight instead has shifted to the ambitious Mayer and the smarmy Devon Butler. Intriguingly, while his stint as Braking Point’s heel continues, Devon easily emerges from Braking Point 2 as its most interesting and layered character. Braking Point 2’s cutscenes are a big improvement over the original and the facial performance capture in particular is far stronger. The interview sequences make for some clever script segues but I do wonder whether it would’ve benefited from a more documentary-style, fly-on-the-wall approach to the dramatic scenes also. The inability to prod the mode with the team you actually chose in the original is a minor miss, but it seems like it would’ve been an easy win for immersion’s sake. As it stands, the Braking Point 1 recap has Jackson and Akkerman wearing Alfa Romeo gear – in my game two years ago they drove for Haas. The other big new addition in F1 23 is F1 World, which is a standalone mode that appears to be built on the bones of the naff, lifestyle and apparel focused F1 Life mode from F1 22. You could probably describe F1 World as a secondary career mode where, instead of taking on traditional championship seasons, you complete a range of daily, weekly, and seasonal goals and races to earn rewards and upgrade your F1 World car. I don’t really know what to make of F1 World, but I do know I keep bouncing off it. I can certainly appreciate the appeal of a mode more suited to dipping in and out for short bursts of F1 action than the more time-consuming full race weekends in the normal career mode, but I’m just not attracted to the upgrade loop that comes alongside it. Upgrades in F1 World come in the form of miscellaneous and eccentric parts and performance boosters, like brakes that will make my tyres last a tiny bit longer – but only on North and South American racetracks. Or a bloke called Robert who will make my engine more powerful for 60 seconds after I make a pitstop, like some kind of motorsport warlock. There’s an elegance in having what’s essentially an evolving quick play mode all housed under a single umbrella that rewards you for time spent, but there’s a mobile game tone here that I’m just not sure I have the constitution for. If you’re in the same boat, the traditional career and My Team modes remain present. Just know they’re essentially the same as last year, only with some extra tracks: Lusail and Las Vegas. It’s hard to say what kind of race the Vegas Strip street course will make for in real life this November but it’s a cracking-looking track in F1 23, daubed in a busy neon background and brimming with verticality just beyond the track boundaries. It’s extremely eye-catching.  F1 23 is a far heartier package than F1 22, with 26 tracks, the enjoyable next chapter of the Braking Point story mode that began in F1 2021, and – for players who love to recline back into the couch and race – the best gamepad handling in the series, ever. The racing-focused secondary career mode F1 World is also likely to be a step in the right direction after last year’s F1 Life for some, although it's equally probable its arcade-inspired, loot-based upgrade system will be divisive amongst traditionalists. "
49,Amnesia: The Bunker ,8.0,"Amnesia: The Dark Descent changed the face of horror games 13 years ago, and 2020's Amnesia: Rebirth seemed to bring the story seeds it planted to a bone-chilling and climactic final bloom. So Amnesia: The Bunker, a smaller and more self-contained chapter, has its work cut out for it in getting me excited about this frightening franchise again. And while a lot of the fundamentals of its stealth and exploration have stayed the same as they were when I woke up as Daniel more than a decade ago, this gloomy, open-ended cat-and-mouse thriller proves you can teach an old hellbeast some new tricks. Set in a dim, doomed World War I bunker in 1916, we take on the role of a French soldier who is wounded in battle, and wakes to find the exits destroyed and nearly all of his comrades-in-arms slaughtered by something lurking in the dark. The first and biggest shake-up to the usual Amnesia routine is that the entire bunker, which feels bigger than it looks on paper, is available to explore from fairly early on. Similar to Metroid or Resident Evil, you'll have to track down a small arsenal of tools to access certain areas and progress the story, but you're given very little direction in terms of where to go next. This helps to build tension, because every expedition out of the lamp-lit central safe room is a drain on your very limited resources, and probably your resolve, too.  Whereas most enemies in other Amnesia games are scripted to patrol a specific area in a specific way, The Bunker takes a refreshing page out of Alien: Isolation’s book and features a single, ever-present threat called the Stalker that lives behind the walls and above the ceiling of your concrete prison. It's attracted to noise, which can be anything from running, to firing off a weapon, to using your hand-cranked flashlight. The fact that its behavior is somewhat unpredictable dials up the dread and adds some much-needed dynamism. And you'll know when you've gotten its attention by scraping and growling that use effective sound design to further fuel your paranoia. Amnesia made a name for itself as a horror game with no weapons, so it seemed odd to me at first that The Bunker hands you a pistol and even sometimes grenades. But the joke was really on me as these can, at best, make the Stalker leave you alone for a few minutes. Munitions are situationally useful, but ultimately end up making the foe even scarier. After all, what's worse? A monster you can't fight at all, or one you've seen can take a bullet to the face and merely get a bit annoyed? Where this beastie failed to impress me, though, was its AI. The alien in Isolation would slowly learn more about you the more times you encountered it, especially if you had a go-to strategy like hiding in lockers. The Stalker, sadly, doesn't seem nearly as savvy. On the default difficulty, in almost all cases, I could simply crouch under a table and it would never find me even if I was practically breathing on its ankles. Figuring that out deflates a good bit of the tension The Bunker worked so hard to build. Luckily, it has another, clever way of making you sweat even if you're an expert at hiding. See, the whole bunker is powered by a central generator that guzzles down fuel like a thirsty elephant, and there are only so many refills available on the whole map. You can explore without the lights on, but it's… well, it's very bad. The Stalker is free to roam the halls in the darkness, whereas it would normally stay in its tunnels until it detects you. Worse, your only reusable source of light is that stupid flashlight that makes a bunch of noise and alerts it to your position. What this means is every trip out into the far corners of the bunker comes with a sense of urgency and purpose, embodied by a pocket watch you can sync up to the amount of remaining fuel to know how much time you have before lights out. If you choose to hide every time the Stalker is around, you'll be burning a precious resource, as it can sometimes take a minute or two for it to stop patrolling and go back into the tunnels. This is definitely The Bunker's most effective new trick for making me feel the way the first Amnesia did all over again. The story is a relatively simple one, especially compared to the interdimensional cosmic nightmare that was Rebirth. A timeline of events slowly comes into focus as you find notes written by the various enlisted men and officers who once called this box a home away from home. There is a fairly clever twist toward the end that managed to subvert my expectations as an Amnesia veteran. Whereas the past games have largely been about remembering and coming to terms with your character's sins, that's merely a prelude to what The Bunker actually has in store. There are certainly some little peeks into the larger Amnesia universe, but I found it refreshing how much smaller and more self-contained this tale is. If you did play Rebirth, you'll be rewarded by understanding the context behind some of the weirder stuff that shows up. And if you didn't, you'll get to be surprised and perplexed by these moments in a way I wasn't. Then you should probably go play Rebirth so you can understand what is actually going on. I found the ending itself extremely predictable though. If you think about what you're doing throughout The Bunker for even a second, I imagine most people will be aware of what ""escape"" would actually mean the whole time. But it is still effective, reminding us that we, as humans, can create horrors far worse than any writer's most eldritch imaginings. And knowing where it's going certainly doesn't spoil the journey. As a final little twist, a lot of stuff in The Bunker, including the monster's behavior, locker codes, and the location of some key items, are semi-randomized on every playthrough. This is supposed to keep things interesting if you decide to replay it. I didn't feel like there were especially compelling reasons to do so, but it's nice to know if I ever get the itch that I won't just be speedrunning through the same route again. A first playthrough ran me about eight hours by Steam's count, but only around five by the in-game clock, which no doubt has something to do with how many times I tabbed out to look at funny animal videos to get my stress under control. There's also one irritating little technical issue: When transitioning between areas, the screen hangs as it loads in, sometimes for up to a couple seconds and even when installed on a fast SSD. Considering these areas aren't very big, and developer Frictional’s games don't exactly look like Crysis, this seems poorly justified. I can't say Amnesia is still a groundbreaking horror franchise like it was at the beginning. The larger story it was building has already been played out with Rebirth. But Amnesia: The Bunker proves that smaller, anthology-style episodes within its universe can still bring the tension and the scares. And Frictional's bag of tricks is far from exhausted when it comes to getting our hearts pounding and making us carefully consider how to use the limited tools available to us. It's not an unmissable experience, but as an Amnesia fan, it definitely sated my appetite for some gut-churning horror and moody, bleak storytelling. "
50,System Shock ,9.0,"Trapped in a hell he helped make, a lone hacker aboard a space station far from home sneaks and fights his way through horrible mutants and killer robots in order to take down the monstrous artificial intelligence behind it all: SHODAN, one of the all-time great gaming villains. System Shock pioneered so many first-person shooter concepts back in 1994 that now feel fundamental, simultaneously paving the way for the entire immersive sim genre. Nightdive Studios has done masterful work with this 2023 remake, taking a fantastic game that the years have made hard to play and updating it with modern conveniences that will let it be enjoyed for decades to come. Nominally a shooter, System Shock is more about exploring the labyrinth that is the TriOptimum corporation's Citadel space station than any combat that takes place within it. Your Hacker and their military-grade neural implant are responsible for the significantly degraded situation here, having disabled the AI SHODAN's ethical limitations. So, naturally, SHODAN has chopped everyone into bits and stitched them back together as horrible cyborgs, made her own strain of a world-ending mutagenic virus complete with freaky mutants, and now wants to export her godlike divinity to Earth proper. We love SHODAN for this, because she's just so delightfully unnerving while she does it. Evil artificial intelligences can often be depicted as cold, calculating super geniuses – SHODAN isn't that. SHODAN is completely, transparently bonkers, inflicted with the delusion that she is a god and delightfully obsessed with both herself and her often extremely bad plans.  If SHODAN's body is the giant Citadel space station, then you are a horrible little parasite killing her from the inside out. Figuring out the extent of her plans and then foiling them is what you do. System Shock is old school in the oldest-school way, with levels that are deliberately-designed mazes of interconnecting corridors, rooms, and locked gates. It's basic design that holds up thirty years and a hefty visual update later, giving you a space to delve out that's hard to navigate by its nature and providing a very satisfying challenge to learn your way around. There isn’t really any main-quest hand holding, no log of what you're doing next (though there is now an optional difficulty setting to change that), so stopping SHODAN means you actually have to explore, listen to audio logs, and figure out what plans the now-dead crew had cooked up. The awesome setting and style as you poke around is fuelled by one hundred per cent pure grade uncut spaceborne cyberpunk vibes. Cyberware? We’ve got that. Cool smart guns? We’ve got those as well. An evil corporation-turned-government? But of course. The revamped visuals and effects are great, and I loved the semi-pixelated textures and blocky objects at work, probably best exemplified in the power interface panels. The new music and sounds are a superb accompaniment, too. It all works together to remind you that you're still playing a game that's 30 years old, but that this version of it has been brought forward in time for you to more easily see what made it so special in the first place. You can even tweak the interface color if phosphor green isn't your thing. As you might expect, you are going to have to bash, shoot, burn, and blow up some nasty monsters to escape Citadel. While the heart of System Shock is undoubtedly exploration, there's still a lot of fighting to do along the way, with some enemies requiring a pure firefight to take down while others necessitate the exploitative stealth ambushes of a survival horror game instead. Brute force won’t always work, so you’ll often have to cleverly sneak around corners and through maintenance shafts to take down enemies that are far tougher and more dangerous than you are. Combat is probably the place where this new System Shock changes most from the original game. Enemies were previously fairly slow and unintelligent, and the whole concept of what a first-person shooter even was hadn’t been nailed down in the way it is today. That meant many of the coolest weapons on paper were hard to use in practice, and enemies weren't very good at fighting back. Most experienced players would just run at everything and rip it to pieces with the Laser Rapier, a kind of electro-charged lightsaber, but that’s no longer as much of a viable option. That's not to say the Laser Rapier is weak now. Please note: The Laser Rapier is still awesome. But other weapons are cool now, too. I don't think I ever did anything with a grenade but kill myself in the original, whereas this time around I not only used them, I got to fire them out of a really cool grenade launcher. Other weapons like the magnum and assault rifle also come into their own thanks to more modern design sensibilities, and for the first time I felt like System Shock was a real FPS. It's a testament to how thorough and thoughtful this remake is that I kept having to check if certain weapons and moments were in the original at all. The new stuff just feels completely natural. The cyborgs, mutants, and robots that serve SHODAN have received even bigger improvements. The clunky movements of times past are long gone in favor of enemies with proper AI that know how to maneuver out of your line of fire, duck behind obstacles, and rush you in groups. The gruesomely gooey spliced-together cyborgs are really the ones that benefit most from their visual upgrade, going from kinda-goofy movie frankensteins to brainwashed surgical nightmares. I really appreciated the unique designs that went into how each of these enemies fights and behaves, too. The jury-rigged work robots rush at you, as do the more brainless mutants, but most of the cyborgs will try to out-shoot you. The heavily armored enemies will move implacably towards you, shooting all the while, before ripping you apart in melee. Bosses that were once simply tedious encounters – like the vicious Cortex Reavers, militarized gun platforms powered by an unwilling human host – are now tense fights that require you to gather the right equipment from around the station to win, and probably not without dying a few times. On death, you revive at the nearest medical chamber you've unlocked, gear and equipment intact. It's a pleasant respawn mechanic that punishes without ever frustrating and serves the goal of encouraging you to explore really nicely. Rushing through levels can work, but it's easier if you've found a way to revive nearby when you accidentally step off a platform and fall to your death. It's a nice bit of older design that aged well, which is good because how you move around the station hasn’t. Your hacker's movements can at times feel clunky and slow, unable to perform some actions that have become staples of modern games like sliding down ladders. That one I can forgive, but I'm not sure we needed to be forced to crouch-jump in order to get on top of objects anymore – that's a bit of old game wisdom best left in the past. Speaking of the very few things I didn't like: Cyberspace. At certain points in System Shock you find terminals that let you enter the station's cyberspace mainframe, where reality is instead a kind of “six degrees of freedom” shooter with mediocre wireframe graphics. Questionably, but perhaps to its credit, the remake is very faithful to these sections by leaving them intact, but that still doesn't change the fact that they could often bore me to tears. Extremely to its credit, however, the remake lets you adjust individual difficulty settings for four separate areas of gameplay: combat, puzzles, cyberspace, and the main story missions. If you dislike exploring blindly and scouring audio logs, the lowest mission difficulty will give you clearer directions to follow. If you, like me, hate cyberspace, just turn the difficulty down and quickly blaze through those bits. If you want a more hardcore survival experience, you can crank up the combat and get absolutely dunked on by Cortex Reavers. I did this and it ruled. I do expect that the most commonly tweaked difficulty will be puzzles, however. The Pipe-Dream-esque power rerouting minigame is ubiquitous in System Shock, and second to finding a security access keycard is needed to open many doors and activate pieces of sensitive equipment that have been locked off. I find these puzzles almost therapeutic. They ask you to step back, take your time, and let your pulse settle after being chased around by, for example, two-faced zebra gorilla mutants. I also just really like the clacky in-world interface of plugging and unplugging power cables. Where many modern games invite you to sit back and enjoy the ride, System Shock wants you to sit up and experience the SHODAN. Tweaking the technical workings of Citadel station to come out on top and foil SHODAN's machinations is just as compelling as it ever was, making the original System Shock one of gaming's classics for a very good reason. Nightdive's remake masterfully brings most of the aspects that haven’t aged as well into the present day, with excellent new graphics and nearly all the modern gameplay conveniences you could want. Get out there and give her hell, hacker. "
51,Diablo 4 ,9.0,"Like seeing your favorite band play their greatest hit live, Diablo 4 is completely awesome to behold even though you know exactly how the song’s going to go from the moment you hear the first iconic note. Diablo 4 doesn’t do much to reinvent ARPGs or push the boundaries of a genre its series helped pioneer, but the tweaks, improvements, and borrowed ideas it does introduce have forged this latest model into the best Diablo we’ve ever had. The finely-tuned combat, extensive build options across each class, stellar graphics, and strong live-service foundation are all among the most impressive in the genre, and the endgame activities and grind are so well thought out that I struggle to find any fault in them – as rare an occurrence as rainfall on Mars. A weak story and some irritating bugs do occasionally throw a wet blanket over the fires of Hell, but the 80 hours I’ve spent in Sanctuary have still been overwhelmingly positive, and even after all that demon slaying and obsessing over loot rolls, I’m still very excited to play a whole lot more. Diablo 4 is the latest in a demon-centric series quickly approaching its 30th birthday, and it largely succeeds at modernizing the depths of Hell enough to finally match its more recent ARPG peers. You’re once again sent on an endless string of dungeon crawls where mastering your hotkey-bound abilities, optimizing your DPS, and improving your survivability are generally more important than things like an engaging story or explaining the insane diarrhea of flickering lights and elemental effects that typically occupy the screen – and practically every moment of that is really, really enjoyable whether you’re playing alone or with up to three friends. Running dungeons captures that familiar but just as compelling loop of killing hordes of enemies, completing objectives, and downing bosses, and running sidequests to learn more about the world’s lore and characters is usually a very good time even while the main plot meanders.  If you were hoping Diablo 4 would shock the ARPG world with massive innovations to the genre, however, you’re likely to be disappointed in that specific regard. Instead of trying to revolutionize ARPGs in any major way, Blizzard mostly seems content to play it safe by making smart but unsurprising changes to the formula, with things like more customizable skill trees and more diverse playstyles between its iconic character classes. This series had a lot of catching up to do in the 11 years since Diablo 3, and whether it’s borrowing combat inspiration from Path of Exile or online elements from Lost Ark, there isn’t really anything about what Diablo 4 does so well that is completely unprecedented. But while there may not be much in the way of game-changing innovations, the good news is that lack of experimentation has resulted in a game that’s unbelievably well-designed and succeeds at practically everything it tries. I’m one of those weirdos who actually closely follows the story in Diablo, and although Diablo 4’s probably isn’t going to win any awards, it is still a massive step in the right direction compared to its predecessor. The quest to find and stop Lilith, daughter of one of the Prime Evils of Hell, after she unleashes her fury upon Sanctuary serves as a fantastic kicking off point that I was still eager to unravel even after my eighth playthrough of the first act during the pre-launch beta. Gone are the days of WWE-like voice performances and dreadfully cheesy dialogue, and the queen of succubi is one of the most complex villains the series has ever seen, with motivations that even made me question the justness of my own cause. But before you get any real payoff for what’s expertly set up in the first act, you’ll spend the vast majority of the next four going on tangentially related errands with more filler than a packing peanut factory, before finally getting back to the task at hand. The result is an interesting but disjointed story with a payoff that doesn’t quite stick the landing. The real shame is that anytime Lilith is on-screen or closely involved in whatever action is going on, it’s absolutely engrossing stuff. But she’s largely hidden behind a curtain waiting for the final act for the vast majority of the campaign, and the diversions you’re sent on along the way consistently feel like unnecessary detours. Combine that with some seriously disappointing boss fights I won’t spoil, especially the campaign’s final one, and it’s hard not to feel let down by what this could have been. It does help that Diablo 4 looks and sounds fantastic regardless of what’s going on in the story. Between the rare but breathtaking CGI cutscenes and the more numerous in-engine cutscenes that happen in between major story missions, as well as the detailed, disgustingly corrupted environments found in dungeons and out in the world, Sanctuary is rarely not a gorgeous sight to behold. It’s no small feat, then, that Diablo 4 sounds even better than it looks, with one of the most memorable OSTs in recent memory, mostly great voice acting, and lots of gross demon roars and shrieks as you lay waste to the minions of Hell. The ending of the story at least nicely sets up a whole host of possibilities for Diablo 4’s live-service future and inevitable story expansions, but I find myself excited about the potential of where things might go more than I am happy about the base campaign we got overall. It’s no wonder that Blizzard allows you to skip the campaign entirely for every character you make after the first time you complete it – a five-minute recap video would be just as effective as replaying the roughly 15-hour story. That might have been more disappointing if the brief campaign were meant to be the main course of this meal, but thankfully rolling credits in a Diablo game means you’ve only just finished the appetizer. When it comes to the things that really matter in the long run like combat, buildcrafting, hunting for gear, and especially the endgame, Diablo 4 absolutely knocks it out of the park in practically every way. Even if they aren’t perfectly balanced, all five character classes are a ton of fun to play as. The rogue darts around to deal extreme damage either in melee or from afar with a deadly bow in an exhilarating high risk/high reward tradeoff; The sorcerer creates horrifying cocktails of destruction, like an absolutely disgusting lightning build I brewed up to stun everything around me constantly; The necromancer raises an army of the dead, steals life, and manipulates the corpses of fallen enemies to carry out their foul desires, for when I’m in the mood to keep my distance and let someone else do the hard work for me; When I just want to Hulk my way through the depths of Hell, the barbarian is an expert in all forms of smashing who can charge forward to destroy everything in their path; And the druid uses their Animorph abilities and the power of mother nature to wail on all manner of demons, with probably the most build diversity of any of the classes. Part of what helps make each option feel unique are the class mechanics that unlock at various points in the campaign. For example, the Sorceress gains access to the enchantment system in Act I, which allows you to enchant a couple of their spells to augment how they work. I used one of my enchantments on my teleport spell to turn the standard dodge every class gets into a second teleport cooldown, greatly improving my mobility. Each class has their own unique twist, whether it’s augmenting your ranks of the dead as a necromancer or bonding with spirit animals to gain beastly enhancements as a druid, and that goes a long way to making your playthrough and buildcrafting on each character feel distinct in some really cool ways. Gear can also substantially affect the paths you might choose to take a character down. For example, after completing a job for a demented tree, you could be rewarded with a magical pair of pants that heals you over time when standing close to enemies, warranting a shift in your build from slaying enemies from afar to something close quarters. Or maybe, like me, you’ll get devilishly lucky when you find a weapon that has a chance of casting a random lightning spell for free whenever you cast an initial one, leading to absolute mayhem when you bring your electrical might to bear upon an unsuspecting huddle of bandits. There’s so much to like about Diablo Immortal that it really pains me to see it so close and yet so far from being a game I can heartily recommend. As a casual, purely free-to-play experience it offers a lot to do, with its empowering ARPG combat and interesting skill system, whereas for those that want to be competitive in PVP it quickly becomes restrictive, punitive, and money-grubbing. And for everyone in between? It just doesn’t offer good value for money spent. If the Empowered Battle Pass and Boon of Plenty offered more, I could definitely see myself renewing them each season and steadily working my way through the many difficulty levels as I ascend Immortal’s 600 paragon levels, and gradually – oh so gradually – ranking up my legendary gems. Instead, that dream is so far out of reach that it’s not feasible, and the further in I get the less the rewards offered by those paid services are actually likely to be meaningful. I’m still going to keep playing Diablo Immortal, but without overhauls to the monetisation and the many restrictions, it’s going to be a dip in, dip out game, as opposed to a world I want to live in. Trying out new builds and experimenting with powerful new pieces of equipment is one of the best parts of Diablo 4, and I spent most of my time on my sorcerer, where I continuously discovered new and extremely rude ways to be the best glass cannon I could be, like equipping an ice shield that froze enemies for the sin of attacking me to remove said shield. The variety of systems available to optimize your character are so numerous that it can be pretty dizzying at first, even for a Diablo veteran like me, but when properly mastered this is easily one of the best buildcrafting toolboxes of all time. Whether it’s the dense skill trees, the endgame paragon boards and powerful glyphs that can be upgraded and socketed into them, the plethora of loot options across various world tiers and rarity levels, the gems and vendor upgrades you can use to make that equipment even better, or the fact that gear perks can be tweaked to optimize them for a certain build, Blizzard seems to have thought of just about everything. And all that control meant I never came close to feeling like my time wasn’t being respected when a loot drop didn’t happen to go my way. There are just so many ways to interact with your build and make smart use of your gear. For example, whenever I outleveled a cool piece of gear with an effect I loved, I could extract its key perk and keep it in my inventory to be imprinted on a more powerful piece of equipment down the road. And thankfully, Blizzard has backed down from its previous promises to make skill tree respecs prohibitively expensive. Instead, they merely hurt your in-game wallet enough that switching high-level characters to a new build is a serious consideration, but not one that’s impossible or sends you straight to the poor house. After 80 hours on a single character, I was still discovering new ways to tweak and improve my build or new equipment perks that opened up exciting possibilities. That makes it very difficult to log off even when I found myself playing nearly until the sun came up once or twice. Running through murky halls with my decked out murder machines feels significantly more streamlined since the dungeon tweaking Blizzard rolled out in response to feedback from the beta weekends, with far less backtracking and wasted time. That keeps things moving along at a great pace and makes diving into the bone-riddled halls of an ancient tomb or what I can only assume is a demon body parts exhibit a consistent joy. No matter what class you’ve chosen, shredding your way through piles of wretched reprobates is usually effortless fun that lets you flex your unrivaled power, though some of the more difficult activities like Nightmare Dungeons are bound to put those skills to the test. There’s also a good chance you’ll run into a random event that might have you rescuing some poor souls who find themselves lost in a crypt, or get attacked by The Butcher, a familiar demon who enjoys meat hooks more than I thought possible. Admittedly, regular minions have very few unique mechanics I could discern in the few seconds it took to send them back to Hell with my coldest regards. Most just run at you while yelping or hurdle some pointy object at you from nearby, which doesn’t make them feel all that different to fight even when they are part of some distinct and cool-looking enemy faction. But you do get the occasional breath of fresh air, like shamans that summon new enemies to the battlefield, making their summary executions a high priority, or skeletons that slowly shamble toward you with big, beefy shields until you’re able to tear through their defenses and finish them off. Dungeon bosses have a bit of a similar inconsistency – I can only fight so many big, floating demon wizards called “The Curator” or some such nonsense before it all just blends together into one big pile of satisfyingly defeated gore. But others are much more memorable, like one where a laughing cultist repeatedly summoned waves of freaks until he ran out of steam and was quickly turned into a bowl of mashed potatoes by me and my friends. Speaking of friends, Diablo 4 is great for making them, as an online connection is required to push back the forces of evil. While this comes with the expected but rare hitches like getting disconnected from the live servers in the middle of your adventures or having to wait in short queues to get play during a particularly busy time, the benefits far exceed the drawbacks. There’s a much greater sense of discovery now as you encounter other players out in the wild (or murder them in cold blood in a PvP zone), and those chance encounters when you’re taking down a world boss, for example, can turn into new online friends. It’s especially cool that trading and clans seem to have greatly increased in prominence compared to previous Diablo games, and there’s a real sense of community around taking down endgame group activities together and helping one another optimize your builds. That’s the kind of magic you can get in an online game and I’m very excited to see what ridiculous shenanigans the community gets into. Optimizing your build and coordinating with your squad means nothing if there aren’t endgame activities waiting to be conquered, and Diablo 4 has quite possibly the best day-one endgame experience I’ve seen. Once you’ve beaten the campaign, you’ll be able to run bounties for the Tree of Whispers, an evil plant with dismembered heads hanging from it, which spawns new activities infinitely in exchange for high-level loot drops. Doing so at higher world tiers (essentially harder difficulties) also gives you keys to Nightmare Dungeons, which are more challenging versions of existing levels that add crazy stuff like an invincible crystal that magically chases you around the entire time trying to crush you and your dreams while you fight suped-up versions of the dungeon’s enemies and bosses. I was around level 43 when I finished the campaign, but at level 50, you’ll also be ready to tackle the first Capstone Dungeon – a mostly by-the-numbers dungeon that serves as a power and skill check in order to unlock the third world tier, and which grants access to a variety of new activities and loot drop ranks. Some of those are called Helltide Events, a completely awesome type of activity where blood begins raining from the skies in certain zones, and uber-deadly enemies swarm everywhere. Killing them and collecting nonsensically named Aberrant Cinders without dying allows you to open special chests that are positively crammed with sacred loot. But PvP is possibly the endgame activity with the longest tail. You’ll find two PvP zones in Sanctuary where you compete to slay NPC enemies to collect materials while keeping your head on a swivel to defend against rival players who might decide to kill you and take your resources for themselves. Running around in these chaotic zones is completely nerve-wracking and hilarious, especially since even your own party members can betray you by scooping up the valuable materials that are not shared between players, leading to rifts in even the strongest alliance – you might even be tempted to leave the party to rid yourself of that pesky friendly fire protection and lash out at a former ally. Then at level 70, you get another Capstone Dungeon to unlock the final world tier, which gives you access to even better loot, tougher enemies, and more XP, and, there’s yet another final endgame dungeon designed for level 100 characters after that – the treadmill of things to conquer is so well designed I didn’t want to get off even when I felt like I had seen 95% of what was on offer. The whole time you work towards the max level of 100, you’re earning Paragon points to make your character ever more deadly against your increasingly formidable foes, which serve as a carrot to keep grinding your way through Tree of Whisper Bounties, Helltide Events, and PvP zones. Even after more than 80 hours on my primary character I haven’t reached level 100 yet, but there is a cap on both leveling and earning additional Paragon points once you do, a smart move away from Diablo 3’s philosophy of letting players earn nigh-endless stat increases in favor of a system that forces you to make meaningful choices with the limited upgrades your Paragon Boards can contain. I prefer that approach to the bloated monsters that Diablo 3 characters were known to become, and the endgame grind to reach that max level is practically perfect in terms of variety, replayability, buildcrafting, and more. Even if you somehow run out of things to do in the endgame for one character, rolling a second or third character instantly becomes a fresh experience since the campaign is optional and many unlocks like Altars of Lilith (fonts of power hidden throughout Sanctuary) and potions/skill points granted from gaining renown in regions of the map are account-wide bonuses that instantly apply to your character. The most important of these instant unlocks is your mount, which allows your new characters to hop on a horse and race off to faraway parts of the map so you can begin leveling by playing whichever activities you want, rather than being stuck to the campaign’s railroad tracks every time you want to try out a new class. Tackling dungeons or participating in PvP from the fresh perspective of a whole new class immediately shakes off any dust Diablo 4’s lengthy grind might gather and extends the good times even further than I thought possible. The retail version of Diablo 4 will include a digital store where players can spend real-world money on cosmetic items for their in-game characters, as well as a battle pass with both free and paid tiers of rewards. Unfortunately, these weren’t available in the review build we were given access to, so we don’t know the specifics of what items will be sold, how much they will cost, or if they’ll even look interesting enough to be worth the price. Blizzard has at least clearly stated that the online store will only contain items that are purely cosmetic, with no impact on actual gameplay, and will include a small selection at first which will be expanded in future seasons, but for now that’s all we know. That means there isn’t necessarily a ton of cause for alarm at the moment, but we won’t know for sure if there are any problematic aspects hiding in these systems until we are able to see them for ourselves at launch. The best part about Diablo 4’s endgame successes, though, is that all of it’s built upon a live-service foundation that will allow the world, meta, and activities to evolve over time. Whether or not that model will be updated with content frequently enough to keep people interested remains to be seen, but even without it, the vanilla endgame experience is strong enough on its own. I can only imagine how exciting it’ll be when new experiences are added to the Diablo 4 playground that challenge your maxed out characters in exciting ways and expand upon the story or available character classes. Live-service games get a lot of hate nowadays, and I understand why when there are so many recent examples of how not to do them (I’m looking at you, CrossfireX). But that model can also breathe endless life into a game when done right – we don’t know yet if Blizzard will do it justice, but right now I couldn’t be happier that the groundwork has at least been well laid for Diablo 4 to potentially thrive going forward. Hopefully some of those updates come sooner rather than later, too, as Diablo 4 does suffer from a few nasty bugs at the moment. For example, if you enjoy teleporting around as a sorcerer, be prepared to get stuck in the ground literally hundreds of times, as Blizzard apparently didn’t account for vertical geometry changes when zipping around the top-down levels. Thankfully the issue can be resolved by just teleporting back to town, but it also forced me to retrace my steps to my original location, wasting tons of time…only for it to happen again when I teleported a few minutes later. There’s also some weird rubberbanding that sometimes goes on when you try to go from one region to another that prevents you from entering a zone. In some instances, my friends and I had to use one another as teleporting waypoints to get into regions we were completely unable to enter. Most of Diablo 4’s issues are extremely specific things that will likely get patched, but they were bad enough to tangibly impact my enjoyment a bit in the meantime. Diablo 4 is a stunning sequel with near perfect endgame and progression design that makes it absolutely excruciating to put down. The story is a pretty big disappointment despite still being a noticeable improvement over Diablo 3 and there are some annoying bugs that need squashing, but the combat, the loot game, and both the sights and sounds of this world are impressive enough to smooth over those rough edges. Diablo 4 takes the strategy of refining things the series already did so well rather than giving it a more substantial overhaul, and that careful and reverent path has shaped this massive sequel into one of the most polished ARPGs ever created, which makes slicing through the legions of the damned a hell of a good time. "
52,Street Fighter 6 ,9.0,"Remember when Street Fighter 5 came out and a lot of people were disappointed by its distinct lack of meat on its bones? Street Fighter 6 is the polar opposite. Complete with an excellent 18-character roster of both new and returning fighters rendered in a killer new art style, an incredibly ambitious online Battle Hub that puts all other online fighting game lobby systems to shame, and just about everything you could ever ask for when it comes to training tools and systems to help you get better at fighting games, it’s a spectacularly feature-rich fighting game. Street Fighter 6 takes many swings in many different directions, and though not every blow connects, the ones that do are absolute knockouts. The gameplay of every Street Fighter game since Street Fighter 2 can generally be defined by a unique mechanic. Street Fighter 3 had parries, 4 had focus attacks, 5 had the V-System, and now Street Fighter 6 has the Drive System. And for my money, it’s the best the series has ever seen.  Every character gains access to five powerful abilities that are all governed by their Drive Gauge: Overdrive special moves, Drive Rush, Drive Parry, Drive Reversals, and Drive Impact. Overdrives are essentially the new EX Special Moves and cost two bars, Drive Rush allows you to quickly close the distance between you and your opponent at the cost of one bar (or cancel out of specific normal attacks at the cost of three bars), Drive Reversals allow you to get an opponent off of you while you’re blocking their attack at the cost of two bars, and Drive Impacts… well we’ll get into those in a bit. I love this system for a lot of reasons, but chief among them is that it opens up so many options, and at the start of every round you have a full meter and have access to all of them. There’s no building this meter up, or worrying about the amount you’ll have left over for the next round. I could start aggressively by using a Drive Rush right out of the gate to put on pressure; I could save my meter for Overdrive special moves to increase the damage of my combos; or I could fish for a crouching medium kick and then Drive Rush cancel it to convert big damage off of a single hit. Those are just a few of the options, and managing them makes the already extremely cerebral fighting of Street Fighter 6 even more enjoyable. The way it’s handled when you run out of Drive Meter is also excellent: your character enters a Burnout state where you’re completely unable to use any Drive Meter-related techniques; your opponent’s attacks become more advantageous on both block and hit; you take chip damage, and Drive Impacts are even scarier than before (I swear, we’ll get to Drive Impacts in just a bit). Being in Burnout is a terrible position, but it is far from an unwinnable situation. You still move at the same speed, your attacks do the same damage, you still have access to all of your super moves, and while your opponent’s Drive Impacts are a huge threat, you know that they’ll be looking to do them, which can lead to some interesting mind games on both sides. Some of the most tense and fun matches I’ve had in Street Fighter 6 have been when I managed to pull out a victory even while in Burnout. Now let’s talk about Drive Impact, because I have a feeling that for a lot of people, whether or not they enjoy Street Fighter 6 is largely going to come down to their feelings on this one move. Drive Impact only costs one bar of drive meter to use, it has super armor that can absorb up to two hits, and if it hits while your opponent is in the middle of their own attack they will be knocked into a crumpled state, giving you a full combo. And that’s not at all! Even if they block it they get blown back and lose half a bar of Drive Meter, and if they get backed into the corner you get to follow it up with a combo. That’s not all either! Remember how I said that they’re even more scary when you’re in Burnout? Well, if you block a Drive Impact and you’re close to the wall you get stunned and you’ll eat a full combo in the corner, even though you blocked their attack. It’s one of the most powerful universal mechanics I’ve ever seen in a fighting game, and if you don’t respect it, you will get crushed by it. And yet, I love Drive Impacts, because they’re tuned so that they’re just reactable enough to be defended against if you’re looking out for them, but also still fast enough to catch you by surprise if you’re not. All you have to do is Drive Impact them right back: you’ll absorb their attack, hit with yours, and now the roles have reversed so that you get the opportunity for a full combo. Countering Drive Impacts is just so incredibly satisfying, especially when it’s the key to you turning the tables and winning a tight round. Street Fighter 6’s roster of 18 characters is mostly familiar, with 12 returning characters and six being entirely new, but even the returning characters feel fresh thanks to new quirks added to their move sets. Ken’s command run, for example, now changes up the properties of several of his special moves when he uses them out of it, giving them EX-like properties without having to spend Drive Meter on them; Cammy can now charge her special moves and give them V-Trigger like qualities; and Dee Jay has a ton of new feints that make him an extremely tricky character to use and play against. The new blood, meanwhile, are some of the best additions Street Fighter has seen. Kimberly is a clear standout, with a ninja-inspired moveset that has her closing the distance with quick teleports, piledriving you into the ground with Izuna drop-like air throws, and mixing you up with tricky leaps from half a screen away. Jamie, meanwhile, is a drunken melee powerhouse who is able to buff himself by taking swigs of his flask, and once he takes four drinks pretty much all of his moves become extremely dangerous with multi-hitting attacks that left me totally clueless on when it was actually my turn to try and fight back until I labbed against him in training mode. Pretty much every Street Fighter character archetype has representation here. You’ve got your grapplers in Zangief and Manon; your rushdown fighters in Ken, Jamie, and Cammy; your zoners with Guile, Dhalsim, and JP; and your powerhouse bruisers in Marissa and Honda. It’s everything I want out of a roster. World Tour is an ambitious single-player mode, and while it is a big step up from Street Fighter 5’s attempt at a cinematic story mode (and anything else Street Fighter has done before) it’s certainly the weakest part of Street Fighter 6. It’s at least a great idea: It’s a surprisingly enormous RPG that allows you to take a created character into the world of Street Fighter, interacting with the playable roster by becoming their disciple and learning their moves, and then building them up from scratch by leveling up, equipping various types of stat-altering gear, and selecting powerful skills. It also does a good job of teaching new players the fundamentals of Street Fighter 6 by including lessons as sidequests, with steadily increasing difficulty over the course of about 20 hours. However, RPGs live and die by their stories, and the story of World Tour is unbelievably dull. With paper-thin characters, predictable plot twists, and a mute protagonist whose main purpose is just to be an errand boy for various gangs and factions, there’s nothing to get excited about. It feels like it was written with the primary purpose of having your character jump around to various countries to meet the roster characters, and yet it never really bothers to justify those trips. In one chapter, a random gangster all of sudden tells me that I need to get her bag back that my buddy stole. And so without any objection, the most reasonable solution is for me to make a global trip to Rome in order to fashion a counterfeit bag that I can hopefully use to fool the gangster into thinking I got her bag back. In another chapter I had to go to Jamaica and Brazil because my original mentor, Luke, wanted souvenirs from those places and doesn’t know how to shop online I guess? At least the tone is goofy and fun, which is a great fit for Street Fighter. You can fight just about anyone on the street, regardless of whether they deserve a Rising Uppercut to the face or not; it’s fun to use ridiculous-looking moves like the Spinning Bird Kick to cross gaps like you’re a human helicopter, and there’s a surprising amount of enemy variety, many of which do an admirable job of teaching newer players how to deal with specific situations that will come up outside of story mode. Some enemies will favor blocking high, making them vulnerable to low attacks; others will stay permanently in the air and must be brought down by anti-air techniques; and others still will try to hang back and pepper you with projectiles, forcing you to fight them like you would a zoner-type character. And then you can also fight refrigerators… And Roombas. It’s weird, but in a very amusing, Yakuza-esque kind of way. There’s also a variety of fun minigames that do a great job of “gamifying” techniques that you actually would use in a typical fight. In one of them you have to chop bottles by holding back for a second and then quickly moving the stick in the opposite direction and pressing a button, which is how you’d perform charge-type special moves on a character like Guile or Blanka; another has you making pizza by quickly performing special move inputs as they appear on screen; and another still has you using your combos to quickly destroy a big rig in a nod to the original car-busting minigame from Street Fighter 2. The best thing about World Tour, though, and the thing that really serves as the carrot at the end of the stick, is the promise of being able to outfit your character with moves from every other fighter. By the end of the campaign I could use Dhalsim’s teleport to instantly appear behind an opponent, hit them with Zangief’s Spinning Piledriver, and then use Ken’s Dragonlash Kick to get right back up in their face. Being able to customize my character in ways that would make them absolutely broken in the real game is a lot of fun. The issue is that it takes forever to level up a character’s style to the point where you learn new moves from them. You do this simply by using them, but even though I only used Luke’s and Ken’s throughout the entire mode, I still didn’t max out either of them. Those who love a good grind may enjoy having plenty left over to unlock after the 20 or so hours it takes to complete World Tour, but I would've liked the drip feed of new unlocks to be substantially faster considering the sheer amount of rewards there are to unlock by maxing out the ranks of each character. I have many more issues with World Tour, but even despite them, I still had a fun time with it in the end. It’s a mode that’s more directly aimed toward people without a lot of fighting game experience, and I think those people will get a ton more out of it than I did. The character customization elements are great, the way it incentivizes fundamental lessons of how to play Street Fighter 6 by dressing them up as side missions and minigames is extremely well done, and there’s just an overwhelming amount of content to discover with two very large open worlds to explore (both of which have day and nighttime versions that each have their own set of side-missions to discover). Another reason why you might want to go through World Tour mode is that you’re able to take your character and all the gear they’ve earned into the online Battle Hub, which is an online social space where you queue into both ranked and unranked matchmaking, or pull up on a cabinet much like you would in a local arcade and await challengers. Online lobbies are not a new thing in the world of fighting games, and truthfully, I’ve never been the biggest fan of them, but Street Fighter 6’s implementation of the Battle Hub has won me over. For one, it’s super cool to look at because Street Fighter 6’s character creator is absolutely wild, and gives you the freedom to make beautiful creations with finely tuned features or unspeakable monsters with out of this world bodily proportions, and it’s fun to just wander around the hub and see what people have come up with. There’s also a lot of things to do beyond just parking at a cabinet playing with either friends or random players. There’s a section of the hub where you can play a rotating selection of classic Capcom games like Final Fight and Street Fighter 2; another section where you can play Extreme Battles with party-like rule sets and gimmicks; a store where you can purchase more customizable clothes for your avatar with in-game currency; and you can even pit your created character against others in Avatar Battles. But the most important thing about Battle Hub is that it’s all optional. If you don’t want to deal with it, you don’t have to. You can simply queue up for ranked or casual matches via a menu, go into training mode while you wait, or create a custom room for multiple friends without ever having to go through the Battle Hub – which is exactly how it should be. What really pushes Street Fighter 6 over the edge is how it completely nails virtually everything outside of its main modes that you could ask for in a fighting game. Based on my experience playing pre-launch and in all three betas, including the open beta, its netcode is excellent; it’s got the best training mode I’ve ever seen in a fighting game, complete with frame data and cancel window data; it’s got extremely helpful character guides that make it very easy to learn a new character from scratch; combo trials that teach you practical combos for a variety of situations; load times are extremely quick and rematches are nearly instantaneous; you can search for replays with a ton of different filters to help you learn matchups; there’s crossplay across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC; you can create and join clubs; and so on. Many fighting games also have these features, but very few have all of them, and especially not right out of the gate. Street Fighter 6 also deserves credit for really making an effort to welcome newcomers in innovative ways. On top of the World Tour mode, there’s also a new Modern control scheme that allows you to play without having to worry about character-specific command inputs or combo routes. Special moves are mapped to a button and a direction, much like Smash Brothers – there’s one button each for light, medium, and heavy attacks, you can execute combos by holding down an assist button and mashing one of the three attack buttons, and you can use super moves just by pressing two buttons at the same time. The playing field is kept even by the fact that those using Modern Controls don’t have access to a character’s full repertoire of normal moves, but being able to perform special moves with just the press of a button is a tradeoff that makes the Modern Control style appealing even for those who aren’t beginners. And for those who just want to hold forward and mash on one button to execute special moves and combos, there’s a new Dynamic control scheme that’s only usable offline and essentially lets the AI choose the attacks for you. Capcom’s really covered all the bases here.  Street Fighter games are always benchmark moments for the 2D fighting game genre, but Street Fighter 6 feels extra special. The Drive System is an incredible addition to the fighting mechanics that gives you a veritable Swiss Army knife of options and meter-management decisions right from the start of every single round, the starting roster is the best Street Fighter has ever seen, its online netcode through three betas has been impeccable so far, and the number of smaller details that it nails right out of the gate is unprecedented. It’s so good that even the poor story and extremely slow progression of the single-player World Tour amounts to only a jab’s worth of damage on its metaphorical health bar. Whether you’re completely new to fighting games or are a seasoned vet, Street Fighter 6 is a must play. "
53,LEGO 2K Drive ,8.0,"LEGO 2K Drive may sound like it was named at 5:40 on a Friday afternoon – seriously, if blending the publisher’s name and a five-letter verb describing what you’ll be doing most is all it takes these days, I look forward to the next Call of Duty being christened Activision Shoot – but hey, don’t hold that against it. Highly charming and imaginative, 2K Drive fuses confident kart racing with a virtually unlimited custom garage, making it a place where you can spend just as much time fastidiously building vehicles as you do frantically racing them. LEGO 2K Drive cribs from a lot of existing racers, which makes it fairly easy to explain. Forza Horizon 4’s dearly-loved LEGO expansion rates as an automatic mention as a fellow open-world, LEGO-themed racer (and they certainly both share the idea of having races and challenges spread out across the map to organically discover as we explore). However, despite that obvious LEGO link, 2K Drive is arguably more in-line with Ubisoft’s The Crew 2 and its hot-swapping system. Vehicles in 2K Drive transform between street rides, offroad racers, and boats as the terrain changes, complete with a satisfying brick-clicking sound effect.  The ability to have multiple different trios of vehicles saved in your loadouts is very handy, though I would say the system is a little overzealous when set to shift automatically. The effect of your ride rapidly blinking from street to offroad and back again, after spending just a split-second on the shoulder, is a bit manic – but you can turn automatic switching off if you’d rather swap manually. If you’re unfamiliar with The Crew 2, Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed’s similarly mighty take on morphing motors may give you some idea of what to expect – their brands of multi-terrain, vehicle-swapping racing around regularly crazy courses while blasting opponents with weapons are very alike. 2K Drive definitely deviates from the Horizon brand of LEGO racing in terms of scale, too; it’s far more akin to Hot Wheels Unleashed in this regard. That is, there’s an effective feeling that bucketfuls of LEGO have been assembled within life-sized environments, with huge, non-LEGO items like tools, tyres, and tree roots scattered amongst colourful plastic dioramas in each of its four separate open worlds. Unfortunately, 2K Drive doesn’t nail this toy-sized idea quite as consistently as Hot Wheels Unleashed does. The lighting isn’t as convincing, and the illusion is occasionally disrupted by items that feel out-of-place at the scale it’s trying to suggest – like, say, miniature real leaf litter that should’ve been life-sized. Also, unlike Hot Wheels Unleashed, 2K Drive doesn’t measure distances in centimetres or inches, which is a slight shame because it’s those last pieces of attention to detail that would make a pint-sized toy racer like this really sing, if you catch my drift. On that note, drifting is executed in a slightly peculiar way in 2K Drive, and by default it requires us to hold both the brake and throttle at the same time throughout an entire drift. It’s actually very easy to grasp, but it does feel a little odd to have the brake squeezed fully down for considerable parts of a race. It’s possible to switch to a more typical tap-to-drift mechanic but that’s a little less predictable and I have found my drifts ending prematurely, leaving me to battle understeer or jam down the brake mid-corner to get another drift going. That said, the sensation of long, high-speed powerslides is well translated by 2K Drive’s handling model. It’s simple to pick up and play but arguably more complex than it first seems – especially once you start to exploit the mild air controls possible via the rocket jump and nitro boost, or feel the subtle effects of weight as your vehicles lose bricks from collisions and combat (in a clever touch, crashing through trackside objects will replenish the LEGO in your own damaged ride). Also, the dedicated handbrake button – or quick turn, as 2K Drive dubs it – is a crucial and welcome addition. It’s very useful for tight switchbacks and an absolute necessity to effectively complete some of the missions – particularly the destruction-based ones that require swift changes of direction. The rubber-banding might be a fraction too flagrant at times, but it does at least keep the racing chaotic and close, and it rarely feels unfair. The track design is also generally strong, with plenty of technical segments, environmental hazards, and rewarding shortcuts. 2K Drive performs smoothly on Xbox Series X, but I have had a friend lose hours of save game progress on PS5 without warning, which appears to be a known issue. 2K Drive is probably guilty of leaning a little too heavily on some of its non-racing mission types, some of which are riffed upon several times throughout the career mode. The collection missions are the most egregious and they’re essentially just padding to stretch out proceedings. The story itself lasted me around 10 hours sticking at it, but I have been left with a lot of uncompleted side objectives. It does a slightly poor job of spelling out why certain later missions are unavailable until you unlock the next batch of races, especially since younger players may just stumble across them and think they’re broken, but the story is very cute. I absolutely found myself smiling along with the cutscenes, which emulate the same photoreal stop-motion style nailed by The LEGO Movie. My kids loved the villain, who is frankly far funnier than the token bad guy in a licensed racing game probably had any right to be. Now, the last LEGO racing game I played – beyond Forza Horizon’s take on it – was LEGO Racers back in 1999, which is fondly remembered by gamers of a particular vintage for its rudimentary custom car building. 2K Drive pays homage to that game with a customisation tool of its own that would’ve seemed like witchcraft in the late ’90s. Seriously, if you can dream it – and it fits in the allocated space – you can build it. It’s honestly quite remarkable. In fact, my stats tell me I’ve spent more time building than I have driving. The amount of options and controls was a little intimidating at first but after a few hours I felt quite comfortable relaxing and piecing together my first project – which became a chunky caricature of Mad Max’s iconic Interceptor. Snapping pieces together is occasionally finicky, but generally it’s very cooperative. Pieces can be painted any colour you want, whether they’re officially available in the real world that way or not. You can group pieces, duplicate them, mirror them, and make fine angle adjustments. You can even delete and add pieces without pulling entire segments apart, like you’d have to do in real life. A range of pieces are held in reserve as rewards or available to purchase for credits from the in-game store – meaning you may not be able to perfect your build immediately upon booting up – but the customisation system in 2K Drive is nothing short of excellent. It’s not mandatory to spend a bunch of time here, though – if you don’t want to start from scratch, you can edit the existing models for a head start on builds. Don’t feel you have to put together large projects like mine, either. If you want to keep it simple, you can grab a palm-sized chassis and simply whack together a quick little kart with a handful of bricks. You’ll be back in 1999 in no time. Moreover, if a meathead like me is able to put something like this together after just several years of riding shotgun on my kids’ LEGO building, imagine what true LEGO experts are going to be able to assemble. Finding that out is where 2K Drive stumbles, though, as the ability to share creations is not available presently. It’s been clarified that custom vehicle sharing is a feature that will be included in a post-launch update, but what form that takes is a mystery. Will it be limited to friends? Or will there be an in-game browser to see the best models from anybody? I hope it’s the latter. What’s particularly unfortunate is that an in-game microtransation store has apparently taken precedence over players sharing user-generated content, especially considering the prices of the content in it seem very high relative to the payouts of in-game currency I’ve received on the way to reaching the end of the story. Most new cars appear to cost 10,000 credits, though some limited-time items can cost over twice that. It appears as a standard service game storefront, complete with the typical obfuscation of what you’re actually spending with a secondary currency. Personally, I’m not interested in engaging with it, and the only reason I’ve used it is to buy more brick types to make my own vehicles (which have thankfully been cheap enough to pick up with credits earned simply from playing). However, I don’t doubt there’ll be kids conned into hassling their parents for credits for new cars and minifigs. How will an ability to disseminate free custom user vehicles work in concert with this? I know people are going to build some amazing stuff, and I would like them to be able to share it.  One part The Crew 2, one part Mario Kart, and one thousand parts… LEGO parts, LEGO 2K Drive is a wild and whimsical all-ages kart racer that’s buried itself under my skin like the pointed edge of rogue plastic brick underfoot in a messy kid’s bedroom. Better still, it’s one that embraces the total creative freedom real LEGO affords like few games before it, with an incredible custom vehicle creation tool that’s just about worth the price of admission alone. The current inability to share those designs with others is disappointing – particularly in the shadow of another tedious microtransaction store – but LEGO 2K Drive is certainly the fastest and funniest way to rock out with your blocks out in recent memory. "
54,The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom ,10.0,"Ask yourself this: what do you want from a sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild? More enemy variety? Better dungeons? Totally unexpected new ideas? Or is simply more Hyrule to explore enough for you? Thankfully, you don’t have to pick just one, because Nintendo’s response to all of those answers is a casual but confident, “Sure thing.” The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom doesn’t necessarily revolutionize what already made Breath of the Wild one of the greatest games of all time, but it’s not a sequel that’s simply more of the same, either. This sandbox is bigger, richer, and somehow even more ambitious, with creative new systems like vehicle building, ridiculous weapon crafting, and a revamped map with a dizzying amount of depth further fleshing out the intoxicating exploration that made the original so captivating. Breath of the Wild felt far from unfinished but, inconceivably, Tears of the Kingdom has somehow made it feel like a first draft. Before we dive too deep into Hyrule, a quick note about spoilers. I won’t spoil the (actually pretty great) story Tears tells, but these games are about so much more than the plot. That magic the first time you see one of BotW’s dragons soaring overhead is around every corner here too, and the last thing I’d want to do is steal the many moments that made my jaw literally drop from you. That said, there are some huge parts of Tears that are introduced fairly early on that I will be talking about because of how fundamental they are to why this game is so impressive. I am going to preserve as much of the magic as I can but, if (like millions of others) you’ve already decided you are going to play Tears, you should probably just go play it and then come back to share in the wonder with me later.  The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a masterclass in open-world design and a watershed game that reinvents a 30-year-old franchise. It presents a wonderful sandbox full of mystery, dangling dozens upon dozens of tantalizing things in front of you that just beg to be explored. I’ve had so many adventures in Breath of the Wild, and each one has a unique story behind what led me to them, making them stories on top of stories. And even after I’ve spent more than 50 hours searching the far reaches of Hyrule, I still manage to come across things I haven’t seen before. I’ll easily spend 50 to 100 more trying to track down its fascinating moments. On top of that, you’ll likely want to have played BotW to fully understand much of what I’ll be discussing here – not to mention because it’s an incredible game and you’re depriving yourself by skipping it. Tears looks even smarter and more expansive when you know what came before it, but many of the recognizable basics shine just as brightly. Things that are as simple as being able to climb nearly any wall or glide as far as your expandible stamina will take you, or the concept of shrines acting as self-contained puzzle chambers you can solve to boost your abilities are things I don’t have time to get into here simply because there’s so much new to cover. I can safely say people who enjoyed BotW will almost certainly like Tears, partly because of just how similar these two games are. The initial structure is a very familiar one: you start in a masterfully crafted introductory area where you learn the ropes and get a new set of powerful abilities, then dive into the open world with a main quest marker that quickly splits into four. From there you are free to do whatever the heck you want. You can even march right to the finale of the campaign if you know where to look, though that’s not quite as straightforward to attempt this time around (which is probably for the best, as I do not recommend it for anybody but the inevitable speedrunners, whom I proudly salute). The bulk of the cutscenes and big story moments are also once again collected at specific spots around the map, shedding light on the history of Hyrule and the source of the “Upheaval” – a bombastic event at the start of Tears that opens up menacing chasms, causes the ruins of an ancient civilization called the Zonai to appear floating in the sky, and peppers the surface with new structures and strange anomalies. This still might not be the best storytelling structure over the course of such a large game, as it leaves you without much direct interaction with its central characters for most of your time playing, but that’s very easy to forgive when the story itself is so dang cool. Sure, it’s about stopping some evil jerk (welcome back, Ganondorf) and saving Princess Zelda as usual, but the direction that familiar shell is taken is buck wild at times in the best possible way. I’m still a bit amazed Nintendo decided to go the way it did, and the freshness that surprise provides helps Tears stand out amongst your typical Zelda plots. It’s not storytelling on the level of a game like God of War or anything, but it can be a legitimate high point instead of simply the entertaining background flavor it was mostly relegated to in BotW. Exploration is the lifeblood of the recent Zeldas, though, and doing so is still an absolute delight in Tears – especially when the new building system empowers you to slap together custom cars, boats, and flying machines that truly let you navigate its world however you want. BotW has influenced countless other games since its release in 2017, but one of the most important lessons that very few of them seemed to learn is that a blank map can be more powerful than a full one. There is an enormous amount of stuff to do and see, and if you were handed a checklist of waypoints to methodically clear off right away it could easily feel overwhelming rather than exciting. Instead, you are given the bare minimum you need to complete the main quest, a pile of pins, and a blank map just begging you to fill it in yourself. Marking down points of interest as you dive in from the sky, hearing rumors as you talk to townsfolk, or simply getting lost and stumbling by something interesting is so much more rewarding than following an arrow to your next destination. It comes from experience, but Nintendo has incredible confidence that we will seek out the map’s secrets without being led directly to them – and if we don’t see absolutely everything, that’s okay. It makes the whole adventure feel so natural, so much less “video gamey” than you might expect, which is particularly important when Tears basically doubles the size of this world. While this is the same fundamental map of Hyrule, it in no way feels repetitive to explore – even as someone who’s scoured BotW for secrets. The story doesn’t give you a hard number, but it’s been a few years since the defeat of Calamity Ganon, and the people are rebuilding. The main town is a brand-new outpost that has sprung up in Hyrule Field just outside of the castle, giving you a hub that evolves in entertaining ways as you progress. It’s a ton of fun to recognize characters or locations and see how they’ve grown or changed, but even beyond those explicit differences, Tears simply sends you along unexpected paths and to unfamiliar locations. That made me constantly see parts of Hyrule I knew and loved from a different perspective, breathing plenty of life into a map that clearly still had more than enough to give. And if that’s not enough for you, there are also more substantial changes. I’ll leave many of the fine details for you to find on your own, but I will say that whole areas have been drastically altered by the Upheaval, causing unexpected weather anomalies or creating brand-new terrain for chests and shrines alike to hide in. The main quest has you marching toward many of those areas head-on, but there are also plenty of examples off the beaten path that I’ve discovered across the more than 100 hours of playing (and I’m sure there are many more I’ve missed). For example, the beach town of Lurelin in the southeast didn’t play a huge role in BotW, but almost immediately Tears tells you it’s been attacked by pirates, putting both its rescue and its rebuilding in your hands. And if that’s not enough for you, there are also dozens and dozens of caves, wells, and sky islands to explore. These are all largely self-contained little encounters to complete, ranging from hidden fairy fountains to expansive obstacle courses that put your cleverness and combat prowess to the test. I loved stumbling upon a new cave and fighting my way through winding halls full of monsters to find some hidden piece of armor at the end – or sometimes even a larger boss monster guarding a shrine. Meanwhile, looking up instead of down, using one of the new Skyview Towers to launch myself into the air let me easily find shrines on the surface before gliding to a nearby floating archipelago filled with its own challenges to take on. And if that’s still not enough for you, then boy oh boy did I save the biggest for last – and let this also serve as a final warning that if you want to know nothing beyond what’s been shown in trailers and previews, turn back now (granted, this part is revealed to you very shortly after the introductory area). Even with all of what I’ve talked about so far, I can understand if someone might think Nintendo took a safe route by reusing the same (if altered) map, but it was when I dove down one of the angry, red chasms that dot the surface and into the Depths below that all my doubts melted into pure, joyous amazement. Rest assured that the generally small sky islands do not represent the entirety of the new area to explore, because waiting beneath is a dangerous, pitch-black map that is literally the size of Hyrule itself. It is massive. I have played over 100 hours of Tears and I have revealed maybe half of this wondrous new area. While roughly the same size as the surface, the Depths doesn’t have as much in the way of side quests or story moments but is full of treasure chests to seek out and plenty of surprises worth discovering for yourself, many of which are brilliantly hidden in plain (if very dark) sight. It acts as Zelda’s version of a “poison swamp”-style nightmarescape, too, thanks to a red substance called Gloom that coats both its terrain and enemies. When you take damage from Gloom, your max health is decreased until you either return to the light or eat a Gloom-removing meal, adding an enjoyable mounting pressure to every fight. What do I mean by “return to the light?” That’s a whole different can of worms. The Depths is completely dark (like, Advanced Darkness dark), meaning you have to throw out collectable Brightbloom Seeds as you walk to see where you are going, which gives exploration a totally different and much tenser feel. There are no shrines in the Depths; instead, there are dozens of structures called Lightroots that heal your Gloom damage and illuminate a part of the map around them when activated, giving you another completionist goal that’s equal parts compelling and extensive. Taken all together, the Depths and the sky islands act as brilliant complements to the more traditional surface activities, stretching a structure I was already intimately familiar with into beautiful settings and wild situations I very much wasn’t. Whether it’s lighting up the darkness below, flying a custom glider between floating rocks hundreds of meters up, or just seeing what’s down at the bottom of some random well, there is so much to do in Tears that it’s easy to spend hours upon hours completing tasks without ever once looking at your quest log. You might be heading to a point of interest only to get sidetracked by some cave worth exploring nearby or a citizen with a quest for you, and suddenly you’re off getting hopelessly distracted by a delightfully spontaneous activity that’s just as exciting. That was part of the magic of BotW too – as well as plenty of other great open-world games – but now there are uncountable opportunities to end up wildly far away from where you thought (almost always incorrectly) you were going. One time I was making my way toward a tower hoping to chart a new section of the map when I stumbled upon a friendly drummer in need of some honey, so I promptly switched priorities and headed toward a nearby forest in search of bees... and of course, it wasn’t very long after that I was in the literal underworld being murdered by a giant robot as a result. I just wanted some honey. Nintendo had different plans for me, and I couldn’t be happier about that. In 2017, I had played just over 80 hours of BotW when I finally decided to beat the final boss, feeling content that I had done all of the side quests, shrine hunting, and other odds and ends that I wanted to do. Not quite all that existed, mind you, but definitely a significant majority and certainly all of what really tempted me. Similarly, I beat Tears’ main questline around the 82-hour mark, but this time I feel like I have barely done half of all the things I still want to. Even more than 20 hours after that, I still have dozens of Lightroots to find, plenty of shrines left to complete, two maps marked up with loads of unexplored points of interest, a laundry list of side quests waiting for me, and so much more. I took my time playing through the main quest stuff, too, letting myself wander and get distracted as I so love to do. It’s hard to overstate how big this game feels, even in the context of a predecessor that made me say that exact same thing. The in-game tracker tells me I’ve barely passed 50%. Send help. So much of Tears feels like a direct response to BotW and what people have said about it since its release, a fact that can be seen clearly across its bolstered enemies and weapons, but perhaps most obviously in its dungeon design. The Divine Beasts got a lot of flack for bucking usual Zelda dungeon trends, and while their equivalent in Tears doesn’t scratch that itch of collecting a compass, map, and key item like in older Zelda games either, they are at least a lot more thematically interesting and varied this time around. The tasks themselves aren’t actually very different from the Divine Beasts, but their flavorful new context and the epic paths that generally lead up to them are a thrill, making them all far more entertaining than the rather restrictive insides of those ancient machines. The other huge improvement throughout all of Tears is the boss variety. No longer are you fighting four variations of the same Ganon-adjacent enemy; you’re now facing unique and often wildly entertaining foes that can occasionally stand with the greats of the series. I don’t want to give away too much about them, but a standout for me was certainly a gooped-up monster that felt like a Splatoon villain had somehow infiltrated Hyrule. New boss-like enemies abound all across this map, in fact, with the returning Hinox and Talus joined by leaping Frox and fearsome three-headed Gleeok. It’s not just the bosses – enemy variety as a whole has been vastly improved, and it’s elevated the still rather straightforward but extremely satisfying combat as a result. At the simplest level, Bokoblins can now carry baskets of throwable items or wear armor you have to break specifically with blunt weapons, but they can also be led by a huge Boss Bokoblin that coordinates their attacks. New Horriblins menacingly crawl along cave ceilings, Constructs can shoot rocket arrows at you, Like Likes will devour you whole, and Little Frox will scurry out to eat the Brightblooms you’ve worked so hard to collect and plant in the Depths. It’s a wide and impressive menagerie that can genuinely push you to play differently depending on what’s in front of you. That’s also true of the absolutely absurd new weapon fusion system, which lets you attach any item or object onto any other weapon, shield, and often even arrowhead. Monster horns now act as powerful blades or bludgeons to buff your base weapons, letting you do sweet things like replace the blade of a rusty sword with the katana-like saber of a Blue Lizalfos horn. You can also do extremely dumb stuff, like put a bomb on the end of a stick to blow both you and your enemies up the moment you jab them with it, or put a minecart on a spear because… I don’t know, why not? It’s a system that just says, “Yes” to whatever you throw at it, and then trusts you to figure out what’s good, bad, or incredibly funny. Even though the somewhat controversial weapon durability system is back, so you should prepare for the heartbreak of your favorite sword shattering in your hands all over again, it’s been totally recontextualized by this new fusion system. Suddenly, you can essentially farm strong weapons simply by killing powerful enemies, because having a bag full of monster parts is the equivalent of having dozens of backup weapons just waiting for a handle to be attached to. You won’t find fire swords just lying around anymore – you have to make them, and any base sword will do fine if you’ve got the horn of a fire dragon to slap onto it. There’s loads of room to min-max and build high-damage weapons that are tailor-made to take down the hardest enemies Tears can throw at you here, but so much of the power and playstyle of a weapon coming from the attachment instead of the base meant I was always excited to hunt down more powerful parts rather than hoard what I managed to find. (Or I would just stick a stick on a stick so I could poke an enemy from twice as far away, whatever sticks for you!) Tears adds additional nuance to combat by giving you even more options to explore, too. Throwing items are now a key part of every encounter, letting you hurl everything from bombs (which are now an explosively powerful consumable item rather than a weaker but infinitely reusable ability) to special plants – like the excellent Muddle Bud that makes enemies attack each other, or the Dazzlefruit that causes them to drop their weapons. These items can be attached to arrowheads for the same effect from afar, and shields can even have objects like flame or ice throwers slapped onto them to transform them from a defensive option to an offhand weapon. The controls for throwing and attaching arrowheads started out a little tricky, since you have to select the items you want to use one at a time, but once I got the hang of it I found it to be a super-intuitive system that let me pull off cool mid-fight maneuvers I would never be able to do in BotW. The complementary ability to weapon fusion is the boundlessly creative Ultra Hand building system. Essentially, BotW’s Magnesis power got a huge upgrade that now lets you pick up, rotate, and attach almost any object to another with ease. This is supported by dozens of special objects, called Zonai Devices, that you can pull out of your inventory at any time, giving you immense freedom in how you navigate the world around you. It’s amazing how often I would take a Zonai glider and a few fans out of my pocket to build a makeshift airplane and fly somewhere extremely far away extremely fast, and I loved experimenting with powered wheels to make cars that could take me from town to town faster than any horse. Your creations can even be effective in combat, with one Zonai device acting as a Roomba-like base that automatically drives toward enemies, waiting to be loaded up with whatever instruments of doom you can concoct. These building tools walk the line of powerful but approachable extremely well, being fairly snappy and easy to use while allowing for a level of customization it’s hard to find the limits of. Why climb that cliff when you can just strap a hot air balloon to a log and ride it up? Why swim across that river when you could quickly assemble a speedboat instead? One time I was driving a little car I’d built, only to reach a dead-end mountain next to a deep valley – but instead of abandoning my creation to climb over, I channeled my inner Doc Brown and turned it into a flying car that was able to hover around the mountain instead. Did Nintendo mean for me to go that way? I have no idea. I didn’t earn anything for it, but that simple act might still be one of the most rewarding gaming moments I’ve had in a long time. “I’m not sure I was supposed to do that, but it worked” sort of feels like the unofficial slogan of BotW to me, and Tears leans even harder into that creativity. These building tools are woven into every part of Tears, with most of its shrine challenges asking you to make use of them in inventive or inspiring ways. However, this isn’t The Legend of Zelda: Nuts &amp; Bolts. That is to say, this system doesn’t warp Tears into something unrecognizably about building. In almost every scenario where a contraption would be the best or “intended” way to do something, you’ll find the pieces for a simple creation sitting nearby. There’s also an Autobuild ability that lets you save designs and hunt down schematics for developer-designed creations. That means Tears provides shortcuts if you aren’t really interested in this side of it while simultaneously empowering those of us who are to essentially play Kerbal Space Program within The Legend of Zelda. I had tons of fun using these tools to find solutions to the problems put in front of me. A highlight is a recurring character who needs help holding up a sign at dozens of different locations around Hyrule, asking you to use nearby resources to prop it up in progressively more ridiculous situations. Getting from point A to point B can become an engaging puzzle all its own, whether that’s building a contraption to help get a Korok (yes, this world is once again full of them) to his far-off friend, or making a traveling band’s carriage fly to get them up a mountain side. Amidst all this cleverness there’s also a hysterical air of Looney Tunes lunacy, letting you strap literal rockets to anything and everything and then watch like Wile E. Coyote as your plans disastrously blow up in your face or simply drive off out of control. Sometimes failure is just as amusing as success. Your other two new abilities take a less prominent role, but they support the additions made elsewhere nicely. You can reverse time on objects with Recall, which is largely used either to ride rocks that have fallen from sky islands back up where they came from or to send an enemy attacks back at them in neat ways, while Ascend lets you warp through the ceiling up to whatever is above you. Given all of the caves in Tears, the ability to quickly get above ground again or climb certain mountains faster is essential, and it can even be used to find all manner of sneaky secrets. It took my brain some time to remember I even had this power, but once I started “thinking with portals” it became one of my favorite tools. Neither of these abilities are quite as exciting as Ultra Hand or Fuse, necessarily, but it’s notable that I never once mourned the loss of Stasis or Cryonis, which are completely gone since Link no longer has the Sheikah Slate from BotW. There are also a million and a half little quality-of-life improvements that make it even harder to go back to BotW after Tears. That includes super-simple things like the fact that you are now given the option to drop a weapon, shield, or bow right away when you open a chest with a full inventory rather than having to back out first, open the menu, drop the thing, and open the chest again. But there are also more involved changes, like finally having a convenient recipe list that saves every meal and elixir you’ve ever made or found, which I actually specifically said would be a great addition just a couple of weeks ago. I couldn’t even begin to round up all the little bits and bobs like this, and it signals loudly that Nintendo was listening to feedback, even if it didn’t always make drastic changes in response. One place Tears hasn’t necessarily improved over BotW, however, is performance. This can be a beautiful game, especially when flying high above its gorgeous landscapes with a consistently incredible soundtrack in the background, but the reality is that even when running in docked mode it’s still at 1080p resolution and 30 frames per second, at best. Obviously, that does not technically compare to what games on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or PC can do. However, unless you value resolution and frame rate above absolutely everything, including gameplay, that’s not really the point. The majority of the time Tears runs just fine, but the frame rate will take noticeable dives any time there are too many effects on screen at once. It didn’t feel any worse than the same exact issues in BotW, though it is a little more noticeable in the simple but charming new raids you can do against enemy camps with a group of NPC monster hunters. I also infrequently noticed things could briefly freeze while diving down quickly from the sky (the same sort of freeze BotW speedrunners see when zipping across Hyrule a little too fast). But on the whole, just as before, these issues rarely interrupt the action in a truly detrimental way. The frame rate dips can certainly be distracting at times, but the only harm they really cause is the emotional damage of making me once again pine for a Switch Pro, as we’ve all been doing for the past several years. Would it look nicer on a more powerful, more modern system? Definitely, and I hope Nintendo makes one before too long. But does that mean I am going to touch my PS5 or Xbox again until I’ve finished exploring this new version of Hyrule? Not a chance. It’s also really quite remarkable that I saw essentially no bugs across more than 100 hours of game time, positioning it far away from a mess like last year’s Pokemon Scarlet and Violet or plenty of other recent games on other platforms. Frankly, the fact that you can jump from the very top of the sky and dive all the way to the surface, straight through a chasm, and down to the floor of the Depths seamlessly, with zero load screens, on a Switch made in 2017 feels like a miracle, and that makes overlooking the handful of moments I saw it hang for a second or two while doing so incredibly easy. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is an unfathomable follow-up to one of the greatest games ever made, somehow improving upon it in nearly every way – be that with simple quality-of-life improvements, a genuinely exciting story, or wildly creative new building mechanics that make you rethink what is possible. It both revamps old ground and introduces vast new areas so immense it somehow makes me wonder if Breath of the Wild was actually all that big, with an almost alarming number of tasks to complete, mysteries to discover, and delightful distractions to keep you from ever reaching that place you naively thought you were headed. Nintendo has followed up a triumph with a triumph, expanding and evolving a world that already felt full beyond expectation and raising the bar ever higher into the clouds. "
55,Honkai: Star Rail ,9.0,"Honkai: Star Rail starts with a bang, serenading you with a symphony and blowing up a space station. You quickly ground yourself in a world with code-locked chrome doors, mech-like invaders with bladed arms, and rooms with monitors spread across the walls. Its hook of a prologue gives just enough that you can see why the story and gameplay are worth sticking around for without grinding. Charming characters, engaging combat, and carefully crafted worlds blend together into a game with enough content to keep you entertained for well over 50 hours, using polished versions of the progression systems from Honkai Impact 3rd and Genshin Impact to create HoYoverse’s best RPG yet.   HoYo has a reputation for crafting gacha games with a strong emphasis on story, and Honkai: Star Rail lives up to it. You play as the Trailblazer, an amnesiac protagonist who travels planet to planet on a train-like spaceship-like train called the Astral Express. It becomes a story surrounding the train’s crew, their backstories, and the different planets they visit. The story has its own twists and turns with some questionable pacing, but eventually it leads to an entertaining outcome that kept me wanting more. Major story arcs dip into the city of Belobog’s political conflict and its poverty-stricken Underworld. It also balances darker themes like loss with lighthearted jokes, some of which reference pop culture or RPG cliches. Weaving these threads together puts the spotlight on other characters and makes the overall story more cohesive as a whole. These arcs kept me up at night, grinding through levels just so I could get to the next quest.  Of course, the story is far from finished. HoYo still plans to add more in future updates like it has and still does with Genshin Impact, but Honkai: Star Rail already succeeds at slowly revealing small details about each character and creating situations that bring out the different facets of their personalities. It welcomes you with an intriguing mystery at the very beginning, and that sense of intrigue continues far into the campaign. You can’t play certain story quests or unlock certain abilities until you reach a high enough level, so you need to grind through battles and missions for experience. However, I appreciated that level-locked content as an excuse to explore the world outside of the major story quests and build characters before fighting higher-level enemies. Honkai: Star Rail is a free-to-play gacha game, which means it will be easier for some players than others because of the characters and gear they are lucky enough to get. However, it’s also set up in a way that’s fair even if you’re not paying. It gives you plenty of resources to get started, including at least 80 free pulls from the banners (which grant you characters and gear) and permanent rewards from side content. You’re also guaranteed to get at least one 5-star character (one of the strongest available teammates) from the standard banner about 50 pulls in. It already offers seven characters for free, so you have plenty of options to juggle. You don’t need luck (or money) to enjoy Honkai: Star Rail, even if your experience with it will differ. The Express Supply Pass is a favorite because it’s only $5 and offers you 300 Oneiric Shards right away, and that can speed up your progression. You need to log in 30 days in a row to get the full 2,700, however. Each Star Rail Pass costs 160 Stellar Jade, so that’s at least 16 Star Rail Passes total.  The Nameless Glory Battle Pass ($9.99) offers more valuable materials like Special Star Rail Passes and a free four-star Light Cone when you reach tier 30. All of these Light Cones are viable in the current meta, so buying the Battle Pass is a guaranteed way to get at least one competitive item.  You can also buy Oneiric Shards separately in bundles that range from 60 for 99 cents to 6,680 for $99.99. These are especially useful if you want a specific character and need Star Rail Passes to get them. I don’t suggest buying them to pull for characters, though, because it’s a slippery slope. You might not stop at one character. Why not another? Then you realize you’ve spent like $50 on a free-to-play game. Honkai: Star Rail has three major worlds so far, each of which has a wealth of details hidden in every nook and cranny. You trigger many interactions and learn new information from just investigating random objects and talking to your travel buddies and NPCs. Just interacting with every trash can in the city of Belobog can raise a reaction from your confused companions. Even Pom-Pom, the Astral Express conductor, seems like he has something new to tell you whenever you visit the Express. On top of that, each Light Cone (weapon-like cards that you attach to your characters to raise their stats and grant them special abilities) has a snippet of lore attached to it, sometimes related to memories of playable characters. There are also tons of in-game books and documents that I might never read, but are there in case anyone wants to take an even deeper dive into the lore. That’d all be for naught without the rewarding progression, though. Honkai: Star Rail leads you step by step through the layers of increasingly complicated systems as you level up, which helps prevent beginners from being overwhelmed with too much information at once. There are separate leveling systems for your account, characters, abilities, world (difficulty level), and two types of equipment – not to mention the various drops you use to level everything up. All these leveling items come from different places, so it can be a lot to remember at the beginning when you’re just learning how to play. At first, only golden Calyxes (challenges you complete for resources) offer materials for leveling up characters and equipment. However, the list of materials you need to improve characters expands as their levels climb. At level 20, your character only needs ascension books (the standard XP-raising materials) to ascend to the next level; at level 40, they need specific materials related to their elemental type or role. These materials come from crimson Calyxes and Stagnant Shadows, two other types of challenges, unlock after you hit a high enough level.  You then need to decide how to spend your Trailblaze Power, the main consumable resource you need to claim rewards from these challenges. Do you want to level up your characters’ abilities first? Or do you want to level up their Light Cone? At some point, it’s impossible to do all of them in one day without replenishing your Trailblaze Power with consumable items. Those come at a pace that feels fast enough when playing for free, but this is where HoYo encourages impatient people with cash on hand to pay to speed up their progress. Honkai: Star Rail features a turn-based combat system that gives you plenty to consider in terms of strategy, making it all the more satisfying when you pull off a victory. Thanks to the fact that each character is a combination of two types – a class (called a path) like damage dealer or support, and an elemental affinity similar to Pokémon – there’s enough variety that I never got tired of experimenting with team composition. Some teams may have an ace defender instead of a healer, or someone that debuffs enemies instead of buffing their own team members. For instance, if I buff my strongest character with a support ability, they can one-hit KO enemies and gain another turn; I also gave my favorite shielder equipment that raises their defense stat and gives them a higher chance of burning enemies. You also have a chance to switch teammates around depending on the weaknesses of the upcoming enemies, so planning ahead can be just as important as what you do when the fight begins.  Unfortunately, Honkai: Star Rail keeps the infuriating artifact system from Genshin Impact in the form of its Relics, which are gear that you equip on characters to boost their stats. There are too many layers that rely on chance, though, because which stat increases when you level up is randomized. Even if you have a Relic with at least three desirable substats, it’s still possible that the system will funnel every boost into the worst one. For example, one Relic could have critical damage, critical rate, attack, and a flat defense (not defense percentage, which is different) as its four substats. It seems like an ideal Relic for a damage-dealing character because of the critical and attack stats, but could become completely useless if your luck decides to level up flat defense every time. To its credit, HoYoverse has implemented a custom Relic system that allows you to craft your own Relics with enough of the related consumable item. That said, you still have to waste time stressing over Relics until you’ve played for hours and found enough junk to exchange for an ideal piece of gear. Of course, you should still be able to triumph in battle without the best Relics, even if it’ll be more difficult. Honkai: Star Rail rewards those who put in the effort but goes easy on those who don’t want to.  That said, this isn’t the kind of game for someone who just wants to run on cruise control. You have to be willing to put in the effort to learn the different systems, enough to build a strategy and manage your resources as efficiently as you can while enjoying the story and characters. Beginners might get away with throwing on whatever gear they find without leveling them up or considering the stats, but it becomes more difficult after a certain point without proper investment. If you’re not paying attention battles can drag on for many reasons, including poor team synergy, underleveled characters and equipment, or type disadvantages. I have many memories of grueling boss battles, including one where I needed to constantly shield and heal to survive because I was underleveled but impatient. Eventually, my team failed: my main damage-dealer barely dented the armor bar, even though they had a type advantage, and my healer wasn’t enough to keep the team afloat against the boss’ multi-target charge attack.  Even when you lose in Honkai: Star Rail, it feels like it genuinely encourages you to do better without punishing you. It gave me helpful tips that pushed me to reconsider the abilities I was using, like if I had enough attack on my main character and where I could get more resources to level up my gear. And of course, I had to stop to level up my Light Cones so I wasn’t quite so outmatched before I went up against that boss again. The fact that Honkai: Star Rail even suggests courses of action and how to look at your stats is a smart addition that will help less experienced players learn the ropes. That’s just some of the tons of text you’ll have to read in Honkai: Star Rail. Some scenarios are voice-acted, which added to the drama and my investment. Long explanations from NPCs can feel entertaining thanks to lively voice performances, but in many cases you should prepare for lots of text. The wordy dialogues make sense in the main missions because the little details add up to give you a bigger picture of what’s happening in the plot. The best missions involve characters I felt attached to, and even the ones without flashy cutscenes made my heart race.  Many missions outside of the main story also flesh out the worlds that you visit with entertaining and sometimes heartbreaking scenarios. You do get to make some decisions that have enough weight to potentially ruin some NPCs’ lives, but they don’t drastically change the outcome of the plot. That’s understandable considering this is an ongoing story and the developers can only create so many branching paths. Should you send a known scammer to jail, even if he makes people happy with his lies? Should you pull the plug on a well-meaning robot to stop a possible rampage, even if it would essentially remove their emotional intelligence and individuality? You can bully your clumsy crewmate or wag your finger at a mean old man. It’s your choice, and it kept me invested in the characters’ reactions to me and the outcome of my decisions. However, some side quests have a lot of information without as much investment. It starts to feel like a chore rather than an accomplishment to wrap up lingering side quests. Perhaps if there were more hidden character lore in them like in the character-focused Companion Missions, they would be more enticing than just gaining points at the end.  It’s so much more than that, anyway. I can go on about all the little quality-of-life details that Honkai: Star Rail includes that veterans of other HoYo games will appreciate, like how its descriptions highlight in-game jargon like “Break Effect” that might need explaining, and offer a definition when you click on it. It also has a Recommended Gear button that you can use to automatically choose Relics for each character if you don’t want to spend time crunching numbers. And each enemy has icons indicating their weaknesses before you even approach them, in case you forget. They even have at least two weaknesses so that you don’t feel like you’re disadvantaged because of just one missing element, which makes it much more forgiving if you haven’t covered every single element in your party. Honkai: Star Rail is the best free-to-play game of the year so far. Its stellar storytelling and satisfying progression systems offer dozens of hours of content that a HoYo newcomer can enjoy, even without paying for gacha items or having played Honkai Impact 3rd or Genshin Impact. Combat boasts layers of strategy for those willing to dig into details without barring more casual players from enjoying it. Its worldbuilding also expands outside of the main story into the side missions and interactable objects, making an already captivating world even more lively. It surpasses even Genshin in my mind, and I can see myself playing even months from now. "
56,dfall Review in Progress,4.0,"With Redfall arriving at IGN just a couple of days ahead of its official release date we haven’t had enough time to complete a final review yet – certainly not without becoming a nocturnal monster myself and staying awake all weekend. However, after several sessions – solo, co-op with a friend, and also in a group of three – I must admit I’m thoroughly underwhelmed by Redfall’s vanilla missions and lifeless world, and very disappointed at its lengthy list of display issues and bugs. Redfall is a distinct departure from the likes of Deathloop and Dishonored. Certainly some of that Arkane DNA has sidestepped its way into the finished product – chiefly in the magical abilities of the four available powered-up protagonists – but Redfall’s open-world approach to a modern day Massachusetts is otherwise a little more mundane in comparison. Not only does the architecture of Redfall seem a little flavourless compared to Deathloop’s funky retro-futurism and the Victorian backdrop of Dishonored, but there seems little to absorb whenever I stop to explore.  Perhaps best described as Far Cry with a supernatural slant, Redfall’s premise seems simple: take back the town from the slobbering vampires and their human flunkies that have occupied it. Unfortunately, so far the experience seems surprisingly boring and regularly broken. I appear to be just over halfway through and the mission design seems largely baked around poking through various locations around town looking for random items and picking them up, putting them down, or turning them on or off. Sometimes there’s a locked door involved, but a key for it will be sitting somewhere nearby – waiting to be arbitrarily stumbled across. It’s simply not interesting; it’s just a lot of walking around rooms looking at dull props until one of us accidentally highlights the one we need. Even the kooky and otherworldly vampire nests, which essentially function as enemy camps you can assault for loot, seem to be a letdown. These nightmarish nests, which remix parts of the overworld and warp and cram them into twisted tunnels descending to a huge and haunted heart that needs to be destroyed, quickly became chore-like – especially once I began to notice the same segments being recycled and reused in subsequent nests. Fangs for Comingare moments where it does come together in battles that would have Blade dipping his sunglasses in disbelief. Unfortunately, such moments are irregular at best, and I think it’s probably due to Redfall’s enemies lacking the wits to put up a stimulating fight. Human enemies seem largely disinterested with taking cover in a firefight, and I’ve had snipers rushing at me like Medieval knights. The vampires, however, are easily the worst offenders, charging and slashing at us like mindless animals. Worse, they just seem woefully underutilised as scary threats. A lot of the time they just float around in the open – apparently sleeping peacefully. They just hover, waiting for us to walk directly up to them and attack them – sometimes blissfully unaware you’ve just turned the vampire that was beside them to dust. It’d be easier to look past the plain combat had the rest of Redfall been able to get its fangs into me, but it still hasn’t and I’m sceptical it will. The story itself seems to be unfolding in lightly animated paintings or static, in-engine dioramas. They all look like placeholders for cutscenes that aren’t coming, and I have to say fighting my way to a film projector to run what’s essentially a slideshow certainly gives Redfall a cheapness that’s hard to shake. Redfall doesn’t save progression for any player but the host in co-op games, which seems fair enough if you and your mates don’t have the same missions unlocked but makes a lot less sense if all players are at identical points in the game. I began Redfall from scratch with two friends, all three of us fresh from the first mission, but while they kept their gear and XP they’ll now need to play those missions again. A lot has been made of Redfall only running at 30fps at launch on Xbox Series X|S but, while it’s certainly noticeable when moving rapidly, it’d be disingenuous of me to pretend it’s a dealbreaker. As a console gamer who grew up playing on 50Hz TVs at 25fps, I’m not going to throw my toys out of the pram over it. What’s far, far more pressing an issue than Redfall’s Xbox frame rate is its raft of other performance problems, from textures that take an absolute age to pop in (or don’t load at all), disappearing characters and animations, and other mission-breaking bugs. Sometimes my friends appeared completely stationary, sliding around the map like chess pieces, and sometimes they weren’t there at all – they were just a floating gun. On the other hand, sometimes a character appears but their gun doesn’t – making them look like they’re playing air guitar. During the climax of an early boss fight my character completely vanished from my friend’s screen, turning what could have been a satisfying team victory into a moment of bemused laughter. During one side mission I died trying to kill a vampire, but when I came back to finish the job he was just a non-interactive blue ghost, rotating to face me but otherwise rooted in place. When I came back again his energy shield was there, but the vampire… wasn’t in it. During a co-op session I found myself (more than once) fruitlessly attacking an enemy who was standing right in front of me but my friends saw as a dead body. At one stage, while playing solo, my crouch and start buttons broke. They just made clunking sounds. My inability to crouch persisted after death, but returned when I fast travelled to a safehouse. The start button doesn’t pause the game, by the way. It’s obviously understandable when playing online co-op, but completely baffling and inconvenient when playing solo. Right now Redfall is not the game I’d expected, certainly not following the excellent Deathloop, but you can check back with us later this week for our final assessment. Luke is Senior Editor and part of the IGN reviews team. You can chat to him on Twitter @MrLukeReilly. Redfall is a bafflingly bad time across the board, whether playing solo or with a friend or three suffering alongside you. That it comes in the wake of Arkane’s excellent Deathloop, the enduringly beloved Prey, and the acclaimed Dishonored series honestly beggars belief. Its performance on Xbox Series X is regularly dire, plagued with pop-in, stutters, and a long list of display bugs. It’s beleaguered with bodgy AI enemies that struggle to mount a basic defence, choose appropriate cover, or even effectively navigate the world. The one-note mission design recycles and repurposes itself all the way until the anticlimactic final encounter. Button commands break, characters vanish, and the cheap and static story scenes seem woefully unfinished by typical standards. There may be occasional glimpses of a competent co-op shooter on display but otherwise, Redfall is just like a vampire in all the wrong ways. That is, it really wasn’t ready for daylight in this state, and it sucks. "
57,Age of Wonders 4 ,8.0,"In most 4X games, the achievements of your past civilizations only live on in animated discussions with friends over drinks later. Your Gandhi from a previous Civilization 6 campaign isn't going to come through a portal to save the day in a later one, with the scars of a nuclear war against Alexander the Great still marking his slender frame. That would be rad though. And it's a big part of why I've been coming back to Age of Wonders 4, as the rulers I led to victory actually do ascend to a mighty pantheon and become a recurring cast for future adventures. That's only the icing on top of a well-crafted fantasy strategy game with varied tactical battles and a near-perfect pace. Rather than telling the story of many alternate earths or distant galaxies, starting over on a fresh map is baked into the story of Age of Wonders 4, where powerful Sorcerer Kings teleport between many different realms in their quest for power and glory. And the way this encouraged me to think about a given run as a more digestible, if not exactly bite-sized, six- to twelve-hour sprint helps to build the sense of lasting investment in the progress of my pantheon. It's a great way to do account-level progression that doesn't feel forced, artificial, or over-monetized. At least in the review build, I didn't spot any sneaky microtransactions. The tendency lately to add them right after launch has put just about everyone on notice for me, but so far so good.  The quest for the ultimate fantasy strategy game will continue for a while longer, as Age of Wonders III only partially fits the bill. Still, it's a fairly successful return for a game series and style that seemed undeservedly buried. I have no doubt that the strength of the tactical combat will help find a strong niche, but for me, that just makes the relative weakness of the strategic side of gameplay all the more disappointing. Along the way, you can unlock neat new stuff from ruler cosmetics to functional combat items, to challenge maps like a frozen wonderland ruled over by a Chronicles of Narnia-esque ice queen that I really liked. And in addition to being very respectful of your time, these themed, story-based realms feel significantly different from just dropping into a standard 4X map with conquest, development, and research-based victory conditions – which you can also do, with tons of interesting customization options. Often, the victory condition in a story realm is to complete a series of quests culminating in a showdown with a memorable antagonist. I had such a good time with these, I almost found it hard to go back to the more traditional style of play. The other thing that had me planning two or three campaigns every time I started a new one is the in-depth, freeform empire creation tools. It's probably the most customization of this kind I've seen in a purely fantasy game, and I was especially excited by how it let me play against stereotypes. You can make noble orcs in shining armor who march dutifully to battle with holy words on their lips, or bloodthirsty cannibal elves who live for destruction. The visual aspect is mostly just cosmetic – it comes with some suggested racial traits that fit the classic fantasy version of each race, but you can of course change those out. Lanky dwarves who live above ground and love magic? Sure. Feline necromancers who ride around on giant spiders? Go for it. Your culture pick – Barbarian, Feudal, Mystic, and so on – defines most of your starting roster and how your empire's economy works. And there are only six of those. So if I were being harsh, I could say there are only really six playable civs with a lot of little bells and whistles to swap out. But the magical progression system that carries you through the ages does a lot to alleviate that feeling. Rather than technological ages, Age of Wonders 4 has five tiers of mystical tomes unlocked through research, each providing increasingly powerful units, spells, and campaign mechanics. They're divided into six alignments – Astral, Materium, Chaos, Order, Nature, and Shadow – with two tomes per alignment per tier that might be very thematically different. Within Chaos, for instance, you can focus on fire magic or revelrous, aggressive infantry like berserkers. Doubling down on one affinity or mixing and matching are both very viable, creating a practically absurd number of combinations for what your race might become by endgame. I especially love the racial transformations at certain tiers, which might turn your people into plant hybrids who can move much easier through forests, or frostlings who can build farms on snow. The cold never bothered them anyway. This amount of customization doesn't always come without some hitches, though. Remember that cool ice queen map I mentioned? I made a badass race of wolf-riding frost vikings to tackle it, but I found that its provinces were often affected by a modifier called Arctic Blizzards that isn't visible in any way on the map, and it blocks your units from healing even if they're parked in your capital city. You have to actually mouse over a unit to see if they have the modifier, meaning I was constantly marching my armies around in the snow to find a safe province where they wouldn't freeze to death. That's a pretty big oversight for such a punishing mechanic. And even completing their final transformation into beings of pure ice didn't remove the penalty! I found more strange edge cases like this the more tweaking I did with my campaign setups. Sure, you can play on a Dune-like desert world where everyone's capital starts underground, then infest it with Cthulhu monsters, but you might find the mechanics haven't really been fine-tuned for all the possible, weird combinations yet. The tactical battles, which take place on their own maps, aren't quite as exemplary as the strategic core of Age of Wonders 4, but they are just as fast-paced and can offer some seriously satisfying challenges. The bestiary is huge, with everything from ogres to astral monstrosities to demons spawning as neutral or hostile NPC factions, in addition to the forces of your rival civilizations. The one place it feels like kind of a letdown is when you're assaulting a major enemy city. It doesn't really feel like an epic struggle through the streets of a vast metropolis. At most, it's a scuffle over the outer defenses protecting what looks more like a village. But I did love seeing some of the bigger engagements that are possible with multiple armies on each side. I definitely have to applaud the graphics and UI as well. The balance Age of Wonders 4 strikes between realistic and stylized is just about perfect for me. Every unit, from a proud elven archer to a snarling wolf, is readable at a distance and projects a strong personality. The maps all look great, whether you're starting in a serene meadow or on some alien-looking astral plane. There's quite a bit of customization for your leader and units as well. And all the interface panes are well-organized, nice to look at, and easy to navigate. Nested tooltips make it easy to get just as much information as you want. And sometimes figure out what the hell the narrator is talking about when they bring up some lore concept from other games in the series you may not have played. As much as I enjoy building a legacy in a 4X game before starting over to do it all again, the fact that my legacy follows me in Age of Wonders 4 feels much more rewarding. And the faster pace of its very strong campaign mechanics and pretty good tactical battles make it feel like I can write a new chapter of this saga in a reasonable amount of time and still have time to do something else on my day off – especially with the very well-done story realms. Cranking all the dials up to maximum weirdness can lead to some edge cases that ruined my fun a bit, but it's not that big of a price to pay for the vast map and empire customization we get to play with. It really is wonderful. "
58,Star Wars Jedi: Survivor ,9.0,"At first I was afraid, I was petrified – I kept thinking ""how could Respawn follow up on its outstanding Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order?"" But then I spent so many nights playing the sequel finding out how they got it right and Cal Kestis grew strong, and I learned how to get along. And now we’re back, in outer space… okay, okay, don’t leave! I’ll stop. The point is that with vastly expanded combat options, bigger, more open maps, vastly more abilities to play with, and enough collectable stuff to fill a Correllian freighter, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is in many ways the Batman: Arkham City to Fallen Order’s Arkham Asylum. And much like the Arkham games did for Batman, nothing else convincingly captures playing as a Force user quite as well as this.   Especially considering that there’s no reason not to go back and play Fallen Order before starting Survivor if you haven’t, I greatly appreciate that the sequel starts you out with most of the powers and upgrades that Cal had already acquired – there’s no corny amnesia or other, “Oh no, my powers are gone!” gimmick to make you re-learn how to double-jump or use Force push, and no Jawas snuck up and stole away the climbing claws that make scaling walls much faster or the Scomp Link that lets BD-1 hack things. Outside of having to earn back your healing canisters and life and Force bar extensions, this is more or less Cal as we left him five years prior. So we’re already off to an exciting running start when things kick off with a brief caper on Imperial Coruscant that calls back to A New Hope before making a thrilling escape. You’re quickly thrown right back into Force-pushing Storm Troopers off of ledges and chaining together movement tricks like wall-running, climbing, swinging, and sliding down ramps. And that’s just the beginning – the Spider-Man-style grapple (which only works on pre-designated points) is introduced before you leave Coruscant, and the unlocks keep coming from there on at a rewarding pace. When you unlock the mid-air dash ability to pair with your double-jump, things really take off – you can cover such crazy distances without touching the ground, changing directions twice to reach things around corners, that I had to completely rethink what was possible. It’s not as though Survivor invented the air dash, but Respawn makes excellent use of it, further flexing those Titanfall muscles.  Moving around is definitely satisfying but lightsabers are, of course, the stars of the war. Survivor kicks up the excellent dueling from Fallen Order by several notches with five different fighting stances that are all brilliantly animated to create some of the flashiest and fiercest Star Wars melee battles I’ve ever seen. You don’t even have to be all that good at nailing the timing of strikes, parries, and dodges for fights to look spectacular and smooth as you carve a swath through enemies (but if you are it looks even cooler), and the fact that arms and legs can now sometimes get severed from Storm Troopers and other humanoids – not just droids and creatures, who get absolutely shredded – makes it feel more gratifyingly powerful than ever during kill animations. After dabbling in the single, double-bladed, and dual-wielding stances that carry over from Fallen Order, I settled on the two new ones: the Kylo Ren-inspired Crossguard style and the hybrid Blaster stance that answers the question of “wouldn’t it be cool if Han Solo were also a Jedi?” The Crossguard treats your lightsaber as a slow and heavy broadsword that’s great for hammering a stunned target into the floor, while the latter equips you with a sidearm to dispatch small enemies without having to close the gap and sure makes short work of flamethrower troopers, packs of animals, or others who like to get in close. It’s, quite literally, a blast. Of course, once I unlocked the ability to throw my Crossguard saber to hit enemies a little farther away I felt like either stance was capable of taking down just about any enemy when needed and settled in for the ride. These sabers pair nicely with the expanded set of Force powers that allow you to do things like pull in an entire group of enemies close before executing a spinning slash to cut them all down like blades of grass. You can only equip two of the five stances at any given time, which at first seemed artificially limiting – and it is, when you think about it – but I came to appreciate it because it gave my version of Cal more personality as a fighter. You can, of course, swap out your stances at any meditation circle, but especially in the early hours you only have so many skill points to go around (and only one free respec). Each stance has its own skill tree, so you’re encouraged to specialize, and by the time I reached the second half of the story I had my clear favorites, and no regrets. It’s a story that does the job it needs to do well: get you from one exciting action scene to the next. Early on and quite literally by falling into it by accident, Cal finds himself in a race to locate what’s effectively a map to a lost treasure planet. That’s very much in keeping with the idea of him as the Nathan Drake of the Star Wars universe, and leads to plenty of excuses to visit ancient (well, old and abandoned at least) puzzle chambers where you have to use your wits, the Force, and an expanded range of gadgetry to solve them. Importantly for a game like this, it seldom feels like there’s a lot of time pressure to rush to the next objective, so taking a detour on a side quest to investigate missing prospectors in a mine, find out what went wrong in a droid factory, or investigating the many other rumors you’re presented with by locals doesn’t feel like you’re neglecting a responsibility to save the galaxy. It’s been ages since we got a great single-player Star Wars action game, but Jedi: Fallen Order makes up for a lot of lost time. A strong cast sells a dark story while keeping things fun and loyal to Star Wars lore, and fast, challenging combat mixes with energetic platforming, decent puzzles, and diverse locations to explore for an all-around amazing game. Despite being a largely enjoyable adventure, my main issue with the story is that nearly every big twist is foreshadowed so heavily that it was only ever a matter of when a reveal would happen, not if. The identities of the main villains are secret as of now, and shall remain unspoiled here, but they’re pretty easy to see coming a lightyear away. In any case, at least they’re written and acted with enough depth that they don’t feel like retreads of anyone Cal’s faced before, and neither is a two-dimensional Sith Lord who somehow has returned. There’s more to them than that, as Survivor successfully prioritizes character over plot for the most part. The cast I enjoyed so much in Fallen Order is back in full force to go through those motions, and this time Cameron Monaghan’s Cal is not so easily outshined by the crew of the Mantis. His motivations are about more than simply fighting the Empire now: it’s about whether he can live a life where he’s something more than a resistance fighter, let go of his guilt, and find a home that’s safe. His path after escaping Order 66 is contrasted against what could’ve been if he’d had different priorities and made different choices. That gives him a lot more character growth than he had as purely a traumatized fugitive learning to be a Jedi. His decisions have more weight to them, making him a much more realized protagonist this time around. Naturally, BD-1 never left Cal’s side, but the rest of the crew are all given very human reasons for their parting ways after Fallen Order and why they’re coming back together now. Greez’s loveable cantankerousness made him a favorite, and he’s happy to deliver more of that along with some sage wisdom while carefully avoiding overuse of his “grab some seat” catchphrase as he pilots the Mantis. Merrin returns with a new look to immediately rekindle some of the romantic chemistry between herself and Cal, and her more casual attitude after having traveled the galaxy makes her even more endearing. And though she’s less of a constant presence due to Cal no longer needing a mentor, the ever-intense Cere is more powerful than ever, and that power is displayed memorably in one of Survivor’s biggest action moments. Aside from a large cast of colorful alien side characters, including an ancient protocol droid with a loose screw and a goofy sea slug with a reverse diving suit and a thick Scottish accent, the other new member of the group is Bode. He’s another roguish mercenary type who, much like Cal did in Fallen Order, initially comes across somewhat blandly as the two bro it up to establish the friendship they’ve struck up fighting the Empire together. As his sympathetic backstory is fleshed out, however, he does become a more interesting companion. Getting to fight alongside allies on certain story missions this time around is a treat, especially watching Merrin use her Nightcrawler-esque teleportation to blink around the battle and pick off targets (riding her coattails leads to Jedi Survivor’s single most thrilling action sequence). They can’t be killed or downed in action so there’s no management or babysitting you have to do, but if you want to, you can have them prioritize an especially annoying raider to keep them busy while you thin out his friends’ ranks. Beyond that, they’re only really used to open up paths for you to reach new areas, which boils down to you pushing a button when prompted, but their banter and companionship definitely liven up the scenes in a way BD-1’s adorable bleeps and bwoops couldn’t do alone. Of course, with new friends must also come enemies (it made sense in my head, at least), and following a whole game of battling mostly Imperial Inquisitors it’s a relief to see that the Empire’s role here is more in the background. Their parade of trooper types and security droids are mostly here to provide variety after you’ve been fighting the main enemy army of raiders and their salvaged Separatist battle droids. It’s a clever way to plausibly merge the original trilogy and prequel trilogy enemies together into the same game – one that takes advantage of the fact that Survivor takes place at nearly the exact midpoint between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope.  There’s also no shortage of beasts that resemble what we saw in Fallen Order – no matter where you go in the Star Wars galaxy, it seems life finds a way to make giant bugs and big angry wampas. It’s a good mix of enemies and subtypes that builds on Fallen Order’s already respectable lineup, and when I found myself in the middle of a fray where different factions are battling it out (including any weak-minded foes I’d temporarily Force-confused to my side) it’s a great time. On the subject of creatures, one of Cal’s many new abilities is to tame non-aggressive animals to be rideable mounts, though that isn’t ever used for much besides galloping across empty areas slightly faster than Cal could’ve run on foot. Given that running doesn’t drain his stamina, it seems that it’s mostly just for atmosphere and to make people stop asking Respawn if they can ride the animals. Granted, it is pretty cool to watch the towering, long-legged spamel carry you across the deserts of Jedah. (Yes, they really called an alien camel a spamel.) There’s also a flying animal that can be used as a glider, though only at very specific points, so it’s not much of a game-changer either, but it does play nicely into environmental puzzles. Speaking of environments, this journey takes us to a handful of never-before-seen planets, some of which are expansive and include a variety of extremely different areas within them. Koboh, for instance, has everything from grasslands to swamp to underground facilities, a massive crashed Separatist ship, and even its own version of Cloud City. They’re far from the typical Star Wars one-note worlds like Tatooine or the forest moon of Endor that are either 100 percent desert or completely covered in redwoods, respectively.  Every time I entered a new area I’d circle the camera, looking for the telltale signs the level designers leave to indicate a wall is runnable, a ceiling can be clung to, a crack can be squeezed through, and more. By the time I was done with my 30-hour run through the story I had trouble even remembering to use all of the abilities I had learned because there are simply so many. Levels are meticulously thought-out puzzles in and of themselves, and only rarely did I run across something that didn’t feel intuitive or fair once I took into account all the tools at my disposal. Considering that this adventure is roughly equal parts combat and puzzle-solving, the fact that there’s such a broad selection of types works in its favor. Puzzles that deal with directing energy beams and even painting paths are clever and well done, on par (and sharing some ideas) with a lot of what we saw in God of War Ragnarok last year. Some involve using BD-1 to launch projectiles to trigger remote switches, some have rolling homing bombs, and some use deployable balloons you can grapple to and launch off of. A few of the main storyline puzzles gave me cause to scratch my head for a few minutes before the solution sprung to mind, which is just about the right level of challenge. They aren’t groundbreaking in their design, but consistently fun nonetheless. Throughout it all, Survivor is a gorgeous game with beautifully detailed environments and characters… and perhaps as a result, not one of the best performing. My PS5 playthrough saw some fairly gnarly slowdowns from the expected 30 frames per second in 4K Quality Mode, especially when fighting around smoke or fog, which made timing by parries and dodges difficult. Disappointingly, even the 1440p Performance Mode isn’t close to holding a locked 60fps. I also saw a few crashes and bugs that forced me to quit and reload my save to progress (though this was before the day one patch). EA has naturally promised more patches will come with improvements on all platforms, but if history is any guide it might take a little while before it’s completely ironed out.  A smooth frame rate is certainly important when battling Survivor’s multiple lightsaber-wielding bosses, because there’s no shortage of challenge in learning the timing of parrying their strikes and dodging their unblockable attacks. I must confess: after several hours of banging my head against the brutal final boss I finally resorted to turning the difficulty down a notch to see the ending in time for this review, which hurt my pride because I’d made it to his final phase but couldn’t quite get over the finish line. That said, there’s not a lot that felt especially novel about these fights; they’re well made, but conventional and one aspect that hasn’t seen a great improvement from Fallen Order. One smart tweak that does stand out, however, is that when a boss kills you, the next time you come at him he’s not glowing yellow signifying you’ll get your health back the first time you hit him like a normal enemy does. Instead, there’s a glowing pillar of light where you fell, and picking that up heals you. That allows you to save the full-health pick-up for when you need it rather than just as the fight begins – it’s a smart and welcome evolution of Fallen Order’s already ingenious system of tipping the scales in your favor when you need it. When it comes to tracking those bosses down in the first place, I certainly appreciate that the Jedi games give you a map (unlike other games of this style that I could name that delight in making you figure it out) but it does leave something to be desired when it comes to usability. Just like in Fallen Order, this map seems so dedicated to the idea of resembling a light-blue Star Wars hologram that it’s not always easy to figure out what you’re looking at and the directions its waypoints give you aren’t always accurate. However, its dotted lines were generally good enough to point me in the right direction when I struggled to find a path forward or was feeling lost, or redirect me when I was trying to figure out a way past an obstacle I didn’t have the right gear for yet. Also, this time Respawn has granted us the ability to fast-travel between save points, which feels like an act of mercy when the objective is on the other side of one of these large, labyrinthian maps.  These maps are dense, too, and Survivor is packed full of stuff to do around the edges of the main story, including bounty hunters and legendary creatures to track down and kill, combat challenges, and more. Some of them are seriously tough, even on the default Jedi Knight difficulty level; I cannot tell you how many times I got one-hit killed by that damn rancor’s grab-and-snack attack, other than that it was literally dozens. But I got him in the end! You’ll also unlock a full New Game+ mode once you beat the story, which is a welcome feature that Fallen Order didn’t have until more than six months after launch. On top of all of that, there’s an intimidating amount of stuff to collect, including plants and fish which can then be displayed in the cantina in your base town on Koboh. But while there might be some unlocks at the end of those sidequests, it doesn’t do much to convince you that these are activities you should spend a lot of time on… unless you really like plopping down seeds on rooftop gardens or watching a virtual aquarium.  Of course some rewards are much more enticing to a Star Wars fan. Cal’s lightsaber and blaster both have many customizable cosmetic parts that you can mix and match to form your own creation, and even though you can barely make out those details when you’re using it in a fight unless you zoom in with the photo mode, it’s a fantastic, loving bit of Star Wars detail to obsessively mess with whenever you find a new piece.  Plus, all of the available lightsaber blade colors are unlocked shortly after the start so that you can make Cal more your own from the very beginning. That also goes for his range of clothing options, which is far more extensive this time around, as well as his entirely new haircut and beard options. He’ll always be the same Cal Kestis underneath it, but your soul-patch and mullet-wearing character will have a very different vibe from mine, whose crew cut and beard resembles a redheaded version of Amos Burton from The Expanse. Yes, it’s a little silly to find hair and beard options in treasure chests, but sure, why not?  Similarly, I’m just delighted at the customization for BD-1. In the first game, you could only change his paint job, but his enduring popularity (which led to his Mandalorian cameo) has paid dividends because now we get many more options for components on his face, head, “ears,” body, and legs, as well as detailed color options and even the level of wear and tear. Just wait until you see the way his body reacts to having pieces swapped out in the customization menu! It’s another lovely little touch in a game that presents so many. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor takes what Fallen Order achieved and wall-runs with it, then double-jumps and air-dashes straight into an epic lightsaber battle. Rather than taking us back to square one to begin Cal’s journey as a Padawan again, we’re trusted with control of a full-fledged Jedi Knight who we can grow into a master of superhuman mobility and fantastic and challenging combat. With a new set of larger, more diverse, and densely packed worlds to explore and a memorable cast of returning characters, Survivor tells a story that may be predictable but is still fun and at times emotional to watch play out. Launch performance issues aside, it’s a sequel that does virtually everything better than the original – which was already an exceptional Star Wars game. If Respawn makes one more like this it’ll complete the best Star Wars trilogy in 30 years, hands down. "
59,Dredge ,8.0,"I didn’t know I needed a cosmic horror-fueled fishing game in my life – at least, not until I played Dredge. It’s not exactly a full-blown management sim ala Fishing Planet, but this 12-hour expedition through haunted open waters is both mysterious and compelling enough to tickle my brain and tug on all the right heartstrings. I felt possessed into flinging myself overboard with an unhinged smile cast across my lips, like one of its many macabre characters. …Figuratively speaking. Starting small and slow is a challenge, but upgrading my fishing boat led Dredge to spout forth a flurry of meaningful improvements to my fishing speed, inventory capacity, and my ability to scope out and evade the plethora of dangers that might rear their ugly heads at night. Managing this fishing boat is no plank walk; five unique zones fit cozily within its relatively compact open world, hiding enough secrets, quests, and unique varieties of cartilaginous fish to fill its duration without overstaying its welcome.  All I know is that I’m a contract fisherman who’s rescued by the townsfolk of a remote island settlement called Greater Marrow. I’m given a new boat and… that’s all. But due to Dredge’s simple fishing and movement mechanics, this is pretty much all I need to know before I can begin my quest for fish on the open ocean, and it’s there that I’m immediately treated to a gorgeous sunrise stretching over the horizon. Leaving the bay of Greater Marrow for the first time and drinking in the sights and sounds is a treat. It’s in its favor that it’s so simple to pick up, both because its mesmerizing low-poly art style is so centric to its story and because it doesn’t really need me to understand too much to enjoy it. There’s no combat to speak of; just sail around, catch fish, solve the occasional puzzle, and try to return home in one piece. In fact, most of Dredge’s story revolves around simple fishing minigames that just have you pressing the DualSense controller’s square button in a specific rhythm according to directions on screen. It’s forgiving, in that no matter how many times you mess up the prompts, you won’t lose the fish, only in-game hours. I even had a friend momentarily take over my controller through the PS5’s SharePlay feature and reveled in watching how quickly they were able to pick up the mechanics. Controlling your boat through tight spaces and navigating harsh waters is a breeze since moving forward and backward (and braking) is as simple as moving the left thumbstick back and forth. It’s an enjoyable added touch that progressing through each step of the main quest unlocks additional movement abilities, like the Haste skill that gives a speed boost that’s especially useful when getting out of the way of a hungry sea monster – but comes with the risk of destroying an engine and damaging your hull if you don’t give it intermittent rests. Dredge’s story is intentionally cryptic at first glance, with your ship’s bow providing minimal context to the series of events unraveling in front of your eyes. But what starts out as a relaxing fishing trip rapidly takes a darker turn through threatening encounters with the ocean’s natural and supernatural denizens – who turn hostile after dark. This tension is fleshed out through genuinely interesting and well-thought-out dialogue with townsfolk between quests, and the broader story’s concealed undercurrents are cleverly pieced together in bottled notes found amidst the waves. Tactfully breaking up its fishing minigames with these elements, Dredge gradually unveiled its hidden agenda and latched onto my brain like a series of parasites slithering onto my boat’s deck. Which is something that actually happens, in more than a few cases.  Things heat up at night when the fog rolls in and your panic meter begins to increase in the darkness. The higher it goes, the more likely it is that monsters and other obstacles will spawn, so you have to balance that against turning on lights to temporarily lower panic. Of course, light attracts monsters that will quickly destroy your boat’s hull if you don’t evade them, so it’s a bit more challenging to manage than a simple fishing game. That brings balance and danger to every expedition. Adding even more challenge, the world shifts around at night, meaning I sometimes ended up running headfirst into a rock that definitely wasn’t there during the daytime. For this reason, it’s never a great idea to make a beeline for the nearest port of call when panic sets in. At least, not without making sure the next few feet in front of you are clear, which is made easier by upgrading your boat with bigger, brighter lights. This interaction between systems gives Dredge a layer of strategy that keeps things interesting even when I’m not making substantial progress on the main quest. The Greater Marrow lighthouse remains a central landmark no matter where you are on the map, but you still need to get there safely on your own gumption if you find yourself lost at sea. And because there is only one limited method of fast travel, the stakes are raised even further if you find yourself adrift after dark. Since time only moves when you move your ship or play a fishing minigame, the constant, creeping fear of being snuck up on by a rogue sunset keeps my watchful eye pinned to the clock – which conveniently sits overhead – at all times.  Thanks to all that, I often found myself pulled along with Dredge’s current, solving puzzles and gathering hidden relics as I carefully built up my ship and kept a stream of currency rolling in. Following the main quest is crucial to unlocking advanced fishing rods and nets, but most objectives are bite-sized, adding up to little more than fetch quests. They’re made more worthwhile by the fact that each one contains interesting writing that fleshes out the world’s lore or is somehow tied to the broader story, and the cast of characters are interesting and likable until the end. Likewise, completing quests is necessary to loosely flesh out your encyclopedia of up to 128 fish, but it’s nice that I didn’t need to catch ‘em all if I didn’t want to. But if you do want to, you’ll need to grind. Each species of fish only shows up in certain environments that require specialized gear to fish in, and most only appear at certain times of day, including species that are necessary to solve certain puzzles and progress the main story. This made it important to max out my ship’s hull so it could survive the long treks to other zones, which inevitably meant traveling at night.  Upgrading the ship’s hull largely centers around scavenging coastal shipwrecks – an activity that’s a little more monotonous than it needs to be, given how sparse resources can be, and how hard it can be to find certain crucial items like wooden planks early on. This is the main upgrade path that I spent most of my time working on, accounting for most of the heavy lifting in terms of improving my ship’s critical functions. But the upgrade path is disappointingly linear, and a lot of grinding is involved in maxing it out. Moreover, if one were to play to the end and max everything out, their boat will be exactly like mine, minus a select few deviations in some equipment choices, so the decisions I made along the way didn’t end up feeling meaningful. The tugboat is as fragile as it looks, meaning it takes only a few collisions – even small ones – to send you back to the dock from which you most recently set sail. Full disclosure: autosaves are frequent in Dredge, conveniently taking place whenever you bring your ship into any port. Plus, docks are scattered liberally across the world map, so it never feels like a safe haven is too far away to have a fair chance at evading danger. It’s great then that dropping anchor at a friendly settlement and sleeping through the night can eliminate your panic gauge so that you get a fresh start at the beginning of the following day. This allows me to fully appreciate moments of tension, since its difficulty always feels just balanced enough to provide a challenge and a handful of scares without ever crossing a line or feeling unfair. I enjoyed getting to specialize my research tree with a scarce resource that unlocks specialized and increasingly powerful nets, rods, and engines – giving me at least some leeway to craft my own build. These choices would move me in the direction of certain quests faster, depending on which zones I wanted to explore first. For example, I installed a fishing rod early on that granted access to Volcanic fishing holes, letting me solve the quests in the volcano-themed Devil’s Spine zone at my own leisure.  It’s also really smooth. I can’t think of a single moment I ran into a bug or a crash in my entire 12 hours playing Dredge, and this might be the first game in recent memory I’m able to say this about. On the PS5, the DualSense controller emits satisfying pulses of feedback in response to the motion of the ocean, and even with a basic soundbar, the ambiance makes a strong impression. Dredge erupted out of the left field as 2023’s most unforgettably creepy fishing simulator. Without spoiling anything, its slow dive into Lovecraftian horror intermingles with subtle elements of seabound thrillers like Jaws and Moby Dick, and yet despite its twists, its fishing and sailing mechanics are simple enough to be relaxing – just as long as you don’t stay out past dark. Its colorful graphics, intelligent story, and seafaring sound design are alluring, but calling it a management sim betrays how simple and approachable it is. Though it still may not excite anyone in search of abyssal depths, its world map, upgrade tree, and story offer more than enough interesting decisions of their own to make a 12-hour fishing expedition feel concise. At the same time, a lack of combat and meaningful customization give little weight to its excessive grinding, and these are clear opportunities for improvement on the next voyage. "
60,Disney Speedstorm Early Access ,5.0,"You may have heard Disney Speedstorm was going to launch as a free-to-play kart racer from the crew behind Gameloft’s long-running Asphalt series. In fact, you may have heard this because that’s what we told you about it back when it was unveiled in June last year. Well, that’s changed. It’s still a kart racer from the Asphalt team, but it’s not actually going to officially launch in its free-to-play state until late 2023 or early 2024. What we have in its place is an “Early Access” version of Speedstorm that just… costs money to play – which, of course, is how all good video games worked before the game industry started copying the gambling industry’s homework. However, despite packing an entirely decent brand of arcade racing action on track, Speedstorm’s drowning level of gacha guff and free-to-play DNA may leave those shelling out a fee to play feeling a little goofy. For those of you curious about how Speedstorm’s Early Access program works – and what you’ll receive for your money beyond simply being able to play it – a 5,000-word FAQ awaits you on its official website. This is roughly 4,950 more words than I generally like to absorb before playing what’s ostensibly a family-friendly kart racer. At any rate, if you come out the other side of that under the impression Speedstorm is a mobile game masquerading as a PC and console game, know that in its current Early Access state that feels like a fairly accurate way to describe it.  This is unfortunate for a few reasons, though none more so than the fact that, on track, Speedstorm is a plucky little arcade combat kart racer. It’s got a great drift feel in particular, with easy mid-slide adjustment that allows us to open them up into long, low-angle powerslides. There’s also a really satisfying ability to transition between drift directions very smoothly. With responsive controls and a good sense of weight to the karts as they jostle on track and crash back to the course from jumps, I really don’t have any complaints about the handling at all – and that’s obviously a massively crucial part of any kart racer equation. That, and four-player split-screen – which thankfully Speedstorm has, albeit only on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. PS4, Xbox One, and Switch only get two-player. There are also some interesting layers to the combat, with items able to be used in different ways depending on how you activate them. For instance, a fire pickup can be tapped to send flames licking from the side of your kart that will stun any opponents you touch, or charged over a few seconds to trigger a blast all around you that can knock out multiple other racers simultaneously. The jellyfish pickup can be triggered to make you temporarily invisible, or it can be charged to become an attacking forcefield that will actually explode and take out opponents. There’s just a little more depth to the combat here than usual, and I can appreciate that. Each of the characters also has a distinct themed power-up. Donald Duck, for instance, gets a protective raft that turns into a ghostly flurry of fists. I like these close-quarters attacks over the ranged ones, and they seem to work well with my driving style and Speedstorm’s tightly bunched racing. I also have a lot of time for Donald Duck because he’s angry, a World War II veteran, and he’s too proud for pants. On that note, the dartboard approach to Disney characters represented in Speedstorm has resulted in a pretty random shortlist of characters and tracks for launch, with The Jungle Book, Hercules, The Pirates of the Caribbean, Mulan, Beauty and the Beast, and Monsters, Inc. making the cut alongside Mickey and his mates. The modern race suits are a cute touch but I reckon the art team has missed a trick with the vehicles, which seem super vanilla compared to the karts of something like Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed, which are brimming with personality to match their drivers. The selection has made for tracks that all boast sufficiently different atmospheres – from a dank pirate port to the Monsters, Inc. factory, and from Disney’s black-and-white origins to the opulence of Mount Olympus – but they’re not especially technical and don’t tend to feel very different to one another during the moment-to-moment racing. The bigger problem is, despite seemingly boasting several track ribbons per environment, the courses reuse such significant sections I’m simply never able to tell them apart within locations. There’s more variety in the remixed music tracks than the racing tracks. As a result, Speedstorm begins to feel very repetitive very early. It doesn’t help that this solo format of one-off races is frankly a bit boring – and when your competition is incumbents like the untouchable Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and the terrific Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, that’s a problem. Obviously I’m fully aware that, with its destiny as a live service game, there’s no doubt that there’s a whole wad of new tracks in the pipe set to arrive at regular intervals – but they’re not here yet. So what are you buying right now? Some digital tokens and an exclusive racing suit that tells people you were here before they were? That’s a tough sell. This brings us to the point where this 40-year-old dad checks out both physically and spiritually, because gacha-style, mobile-inspired upgrade and currency systems are like absolute kryptonite to me. Put clearly, the sheer amount of menu nonsense and overlapping economies in Speedstorm is simply absurd. Tokens are blue. You earn these from completing objectives during races and moving up reward tiers, and we will apparently be able to buy Tokens to access locked content faster. Then there are tokens that are like Tokens, but yellow. These are Season Coins. You get these from moving through the Golden Pass, which is Speedstorm’s battlepass equivalent. I bought that with a Golden Pass Credit. That’s another currency that came with the Early Access pack, separate to the Tokens and Season Coins. Then there are the Seasonal Tickets and Universal Box Credits, which seem like Tokens but they’re purple. Also separate are the Multiplayer Coins, which are tokens that naturally come from competing online. There’s ranked multiplayer racing, where you take your characters in at whatever level you have them, and “regulated” racing, where racer stats are standardised. I’ve won races in both, but kart racing seems quite soulless racing against strangers and I can’t understand the appeal. It belongs on the couch, if you ask me. You’ll have to do it if you want to use the Speedstorm shop, though, because sometimes things cost Multiplayer tokens. However, some other things cost blue tokens, and some things cost yellow tokens. Sometimes they cost a purple one, because why not? Sometimes items are just there, a la carte, and sometimes they’re in a blind box. Did I mention there are different types of boxes? There are different types of boxes. Then there are Racer Shards, which are essentially another currency unique to each individual character that you use to unlock racers and upgrade your characters’ star levels, and then there are upgrade materials, which also stack as basically another currency you also need to upgrade your characters. You’ll need to do that to keep up with the competition. This stuff can be found in the loot boxes you earn playing, rewarded via the Golden Pass, or simply bought from the shop with one of several currencies. Maybe in a box. Maybe not. For 1,200 Tokens I bought 20 Mulan shards, which are automatically traded for one Mulan star. I want to make my Mike Wazowski faster, but now I need four Scare Tanks, one turbo, and four wrenches, and I'm short two wrenches. Did anybody say any of this out loud? Are you still following? Because frankly I don’t think I am anymore. The mechanical monkey in my brain just backflipped off a building. I haven’t even got to the crew mechanic, which appears to be JPGs of other random Disney characters here to be another thing you need to upgrade. Or the Loot Points. Or the Collection Level, which are points, but different. Are kids meant to understand this? This doesn’t sound like a game; it sounds like a job. Disney Speedstorm in Early Access is a fundamentally good kart racer that’s currently too light on tracks and too repetitive to warrant the required investment. Worse still, it’s buried beneath a veritable Splash Mountain of gacha garbage and so many discrete currencies that do different things that it almost seems like a parody of the entire free-to-play genre. Nothing sucks like gacha, plucks your bucks like gacha, makes you jump through hoops for Donald Duck like gacha. "
61,Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp ,8.0,"While I have always favored the Fire Emblem franchise as my Nintendo turn-based tactical game of choice, the Advance Wars series has always held a special place in my heart ever since the first time I booted it up on my Game Boy Advance 22 years ago. I’ve always enjoyed how these games encourage me to get creative with my units and strategies. Whether that is hiding my army in the fog of war and taking advantage of the terrain to obliterate my opponents before they know what’s hitting them, or building a massive platoon of tanks and steamrolling the enemy with my oppressive numbers. It’s rewarding to see my plans work out as intended, and though it stings when they fail, I feel like I always learn something about how to improve my future strategies.   Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp may not have a large variety in its game modes, but the amount of variables you can swap around to your liking makes each battle feel fresh even when replaying maps. The improvements to the visuals and music of the original, in addition to the inclusion of other modernizations like voice acting, animated shorts, and online play, make it a great way to experience these classics for veterans and newcomers alike. My 60 hours with Re-Boot Camp took me through both campaigns, including alternative missions with different characters that unlocked after completing each campaign, warring with AI on a variety of unlockable maps, spending time designing my own maps, and a small taste of online multiplayer. It took 15 and 25 hours to complete each respective campaign on the classic difficulty setting (the hardest available from the start). Even having turned it up a notch, the difficulty curve for the original Advance Wars is consistently on the easier end thanks to many of the missions mostly serving as tutorials for new mechanics, win conditions, introducing new commanding officers (COs), and more – it’s not until the final missions of each section of the campaign that things pick up. But once you reach the Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising campaign it starts to include a lot more missions with some surprising difficulty spikes due to the introduction of the new Black Hole army COs and their powerful new abilities. While the missions may not always be difficult, some ended up taking a while to finish due to the scope of battles where you control multiple armies, or tactical errors on my part, like losing my last infantry unit to hidden artillery, requiring me to spend a large number of extra turns to wipe out the enemy army instead of capturing the enemy base in two or three turns. The good news is that if you were hoping for more of a challenge, finishing each campaign unlocks a new Challenge difficulty that has started to push some of my previous winning strategies to their limits, causing me to reassess which CO and strategy to use on each map when given a choice. It would’ve been nice for that mode to be available from the start for those of us who already know our way around this series. Re-Boot Camp has updated the Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising campaigns with a charming new art style thanks to the use of 3D graphics, a fantastic re-recorded soundtrack, online multiplayer, and a few features like the ability to restart a turn to help newcomers learn from their mistakes, and the option to fast-forward battle animations to reduce the time between turns if you like. The soundtrack is one of the highlights for me, as each CO has a distinct musical theme during their turns which helps each battle feel fresh. Grit from the Blue Moon Army has a bit of a bluegrass style to mirror his laid-back attitude, while the theme from the Yellow Comet’s Sensei uses a piano and saxophone to give an upbeat jazz feel to his turns. Outside of the updated visuals and new features, Re-Boot Camp maintains its faithful retelling of the wars between the various nations of Cosmo and Macro Land and the mysterious Black Hole Army, meaning if you were hoping to see any of the new additions or changes included in later games like Dual Strike or Days of Ruin, you will still need to boot up your DS for that experience. (The attention to detail in nearly every area of Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp does give me hope that the third and fourth games will get the same treatment next.) While neither story is what I would call deep, they both have their brighter moments, with the Black Hole Rising campaign being an improvement thanks to the addition of the new COs and their various personalities. In addition to the Orange Star army COs, commanding officers from the other nations get a modest amount of voice acting that helps to show off each of the characters’ unique personalities. The performances aren’t anything to write home about, but that is more based on the lack of quantity than the quality of them. One of the most intriguing additions is the inclusion of a few animated shorts that had me wondering if we might get an Advance Wars animated show down the road now that Nintendo has seen so much success with the Mario movie.   Each of the COs has their own specialty when building armies, as well as a unique power that can help turn the tide in combat. The spirited but inexperienced mechanic Andy is well-rounded with no bonuses or penalties but has the ability to restore health to his units with his hyper-repair power, making him a safe choice in most battles. The straightforward and brawny Max gives a power boost to all direct damage units while his indirect units, like artillery or rockets, suffer a penalty to their maximum range, making him a good option for when you want to punch through an enemy’s defenses and overwhelm them with raw power. Advance Wars 2 adds new depth to the formula by including Super CO powers. These often add alternatives to traditional CO powers, like utility effects – such as refilling your unit's ammunition and fuel or increasing your vision range in the fog of war. The happy-go-lucky special forces commander Sami grants large bonuses to her infantry units when she activates her Super CO power, giving them the ability to capture buildings in a single turn, including enemy HQs, to sneak a victory out of even the direst of situations. It’s important to know each one's strengths and weaknesses otherwise, even the best-laid plans can come undone. While many battles in Advance Wars can devolve into a contest of who has the superior numbers, using the proper units in the right positions can help neutralize even the largest of armies. One of the most common tactics is to place a more durable unit, like the medium tank, on a bridge to prevent your opponent's advance and then barraging their army with artillery or rockets to reduce their numbers so you can go on the offensive. Building an army of units that cover land, air, and sea gives a lot of versatility to strategies across most maps, and building to your CO's strengths will often tip the scale in your favor. Battles waged in the air are best with the use of COs like Eagle or Sensei, who give large boosts to various aerial units, while Grit’s long range makes it easy to overwhelm opponents from the shadows on maps that have fog of war. At the end of a mission, Advance Wars will grade you based on speed, power, and technique. So the faster you are at claiming victory while efficiently destroying your opponent's units without losing your own, the higher the rating you will earn, meaning more currency to unlock new maps, music, and COs for game modes outside the campaign. This helps to improve the mileage you will get out of Advance Wars, since its replayability depends on the unlockable content, so the better you rank, the faster you can unlock more of the content to give you more options and extend your play further.  Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp’s customizable War Room is one of the areas where I got the most replayability out of it, and foresee it earning the bulk of my time moving forward. Being able to take on the role of any CO on a sizeable number of maps against a variety of AI-controlled opponents with a variety of customizable parameters like fog of war, weather, and victory conditions means there is almost no limit to the ways you can make each battle feel different, even when revisiting favorite maps. And if the included maps start to feel too familiar, the Design Room map editor is another way to make it feel new again and is only limited by your creativity. Anything you see in the campaigns is at your fingertips, so if you want to build a map that's all water and play an Advance Wars version of Battleship, you can. Afterward, you can share those maps online, so if you have a good group of creative friends, you can swap maps for an effectively limitless amount of content.  The online multiplayer in Re-Boot Camp is one of the biggest letdowns for me in that there’s no matchmaking system at all. That means you can only compete against opponents on your friends list, so if you happen to be the only person in your group of friends who owns it, you’re going to either need to make some more friends or get comfortable only competing against the AI. On current-generation hardware like the Switch, it’s just plain disappointing not to have a matchmaking lobby. Thankfully, it does have the option for local multiplayer on either the same console or with others on their own Switch, meaning that it will surely see some popularity at various conventions and gatherings. With nicely redone graphics and excellent music bringing the classic turn-based tactical action up to modern standards, Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp is a great return for this long-neglected series and gives me hope for a follow-up that includes the DS games. While there isn’t much variety in the game modes, Advance Wars’ depth comes from the number of variables you can adjust to make every match feel unique. The biggest miss is the lack of multiplayer matchmaking, which makes it harder to get into a game than it ought to be in 2023, but at least you can play online. Playing against the AI will keep me interested in the short term, but I predict the inability to play against random opponents online will limit my spontaneous play sessions. However, the sheer number of maps, playable COs, and options for each match means that when I do, it's sure to be a unique experience. "
62,The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story ,7.0,"Magic is everywhere if you know where to look, and you need look no further than Digital Sun’s The Mageseeker. It’s a worthy addition to the growing list of League of Legends spinoffs, this time a pixel-art action RPG puts you in the role of Sylas The Unshackled as he escapes from prison to seek his revenge against those that locked him away since his childhood. It’s faithful to the lore of League of Legends and expands on it in exciting new ways, showing us even more of the spell-stealing rebel. I came away from my time with The Mageseeker enjoying the journey but wishing it had taken a few different paths along the way. Following in the footsteps of other League of Legends spinoffs like Ruined King and Hextech Mayhem, The Mageseeker brings another batch of characters from their 160+ champion roster to life in a new way. Sylas is depicted in a bigger way than ever before as he helps to lead a rebellion against the tyrannical kingdom of Demacia, where mages are hunted. The story has some nuance and even lightly parallels moments of real-world history where a group of people has been persecuted for being different.  It took around 18 hours to not only finish The Mageseeker on the hard difficulty, but also complete everything necessary for the platinum trophy on PlayStation 5. This included all the sidequests, replaying a handful of missions to gather any collectibles I missed on my first playthrough, and a handful of restarts against a few bosses who gave me a bit of trouble. You only ever play as Sylas, but The Mageseeker brings along a few other fan-favorite characters like Morgana, Garen, Lux, Jarvan IV, Shyvana, and a few surprises that I won’t spoil along for the ride. I had a lot of fun seeing how Digital Sun envisioned just how powerful these champions could be when not constrained by the need to be balanced in a competitive landscape. Morgana’s Dark Bindings last longer, Lux’s lasers are larger than life, and Shyvana gets to show her true scale when transforming into her dragon form. There are also plenty of Easter eggs and other fun nods throughout the story that are sure to please fans of League of Legends. In addition to those familiar faces, Sylas is joined by some entertaining original characters who take on different supporting roles throughout the story of vengeance, growth, and rebellion. There are a few standouts, such as Leilani, who forms a strong bond with Sylas early on and serves as the guiding light of the rebellion while Sylas does what must be done on their journey in the hope of freeing themselves from the persecution of the Mageseekers who are out to imprison or eliminate them.  The Mageseeker begins with a literal bang as Sylas borrows the magic of a young Lux to make his escape from his Demacian prison and upcoming execution. Though the first mission seems momentous, it hits a bit of a slowdown early on as Sylas comes into the role of rebel leader. The Mageseeker absolutely nails the feeling of playing Sylas: the way you can repeatedly dash, use your chains to pull yourself to enemies or around the environment, and all the spells you can borrow and use for your own purposes. Anyone who has played a match of League of Legends as Sylas will be right at home when in combat, though the mechanics are intuitive enough that even those who haven’t should be able to pick it up just as easily. As Sylas, you have the ability to sense and borrow the magical abilities of others and use them against anyone who stands in your way. Including powerful ultimate abilities I gained access to 30 different spells most of which fell into six different elemental trees, nearly all of which played a useful role in various moments as I progressed. Early spells included elemental projectiles to counter enemies with opposing affinities, while the later spells granted large area-of-effect versions or spells for healing, shielding, or imbuing my melee strikes with elemental buffs. Spells stolen from enemies are single-use, but as you progress you gain the ability to craft spells you’ve borrowed and can cast them as you see fit, as long as you have the mana to do so. Combat starts out simple, but in the later levels, when facing larger groups of enemies and their numerous projectiles, I found that if I wasn’t staying mobile and dashing or pulling myself to enemies I’d lose large chunks of health. While I primarily focused on using spells that either recovered my health or granted me a shield, that was more about my playstyle than out of necessity: there are plenty of options, and the ability to swap out your spells at any of the generous checkpoints placed throughout the stages gives even more flexibility. In addition to standard spells, Sylas will also gain access to powerful ultimate abilities that, for the most part, enable him to deal massive amounts of damage but also temporarily boost his power. Using Lux’s ultimate, Final Spark, to fire a large concentrated beam of light to disintegrate large groups of enemies is almost as enjoyable as securing multiple kills with the same ability in regular League of Legends matches. There is plenty of enemy diversity, and they range from elemental mages employed by the Mageseekers that cast spells to hurl shards of ice, heal other enemies, or create cyclones of damaging wind. As well as creature based enemies ranging from fiery frogs named lava gromps that fans of League will recognize who can create fields of fire, as well as other larger beasts that summon homing beams of lightning, like the gorilla-lizard hybrid Thunderbeasts. Levels continually mixed up the arrangements of enemies, adding a nice level of depth that kept me on my toes when it came to deciding which enemies to prioritize. Most stages are very straightforward and follow a similar pattern of simple platforming using Sylas’ chains or dashes to cross short gaps, a few enemy encounters that need to be cleared before a door or gate unlocks, and a boss that typically incorporates the elements from the rest of the level. I would have liked to have seen some additional elements in the levels, such as light puzzles or optional platforming challenges to make me earn the rewards placed throughout the map, rather than just being given them as a reward for exploring. There are numerous unlit braziers and other objects in the background that could have been used for triggering something magical like a hidden passage or revealing a chest, but I was always disappointed that casting fire spells on them didn’t do anything. It’s a missed opportunity to encourage replayability and creative use of spells. The bosses, though, are one of the biggest highlights in Mageseeker. While I could get away with whatever spell loadout I wanted in some battles thanks to Sylas’s excellent mobility, others benefited greatly from swapping out my equipped spells to give me an elemental advantage or boost my survivability with heal or shield spells. On the hard difficulty level, many of the earlier bosses would wipe me out in four to six, hits depending on the attack. It became a bit more forgiving once I’d picked up some health and defense upgrades towards the middle of the campaign, only for the steep challenge to return in the final hours of the campaign with an increased volume of more powerful enemies; thankfully this is balanced by the addition of more ways to heal or mitigate damage.  This created a new dynamic of requiring me to decide on how best to use my mana, either recovering my health or dishing out more damage with flashy spells In addition to the main missions, there are two chains of sidequests. One had me assaulting Mageseeker bases using uniquely empowered versions of my spells, giving these levels almost a roguelike feel that offered some of the most fun in the entire campaign, despite how the side missions reuse the same bosses. The other chain of missions is a series of basic arenas that end with some of the more exciting bosses that fans of League of Legends will want to see. Levels are also filled with various collectibles, such as the adorable silverwings, mages to recruit, and notes dropped by characters that help offer more background information on the state of the world or their lives.  The musical score is filled with fast tempos to match the often chaotic battles, paired with relaxing rhythms during your time in base between levels.  Each location has its own style, with the music evolving as you progress further, and culminates into an exhilarating melody during the boss battles. The Mageseeker remains faithful to its source material by using various voice lines and sound effects from League of Legends as characters cast their abilities, and while there is limited voice acting, overall it's still entertaining to hear familiar elements outside of their normal environment.  I did run into a few bugs during my playthrough: I had enemies and bosses become unkillable, lost the ability to use my chains to grapple or borrow abilities, and one peculiar one where a falling rock followed me wherever I went, including the main menu. It was nothing a quit-and-reload or reboot couldn’t fix, but they did pop up enough times to warrant mentioning. The Mageseeker: A League of Legends story is another solid example of Riot Forge partnering with talented developers to bring League’s rich list of champions to life in new genres to showcase more sides of their characters. The story goes to some interesting places after a slow start, picking up steam in the second half and leading to a momentous finale. Levels are fairly straightforward and could have benefitted from additional content, like optional puzzles or bonus objectives, but the bosses and variety of abilities is enough to keep you on your toes despite some of the repetition. "
63,Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores ,8.0,"It would have been relatively easy for Guerrilla Games to rest on their laurels and put out a Horizon expansion that was just more Forbidden West. And in some ways, the Burning Shores DLC is exactly that: a distilled helping of what made the core game so great – an elevated sci-fi story in a pulpy wrapping, tied with a bow made from high-octane action. You'll once again be fighting machines, solving puzzles, and yes, climbing tall structures. But Guerrilla has done much more here, adding in surprises with new machines to discover and introducing even more fun ways to take them down. Burning Shores is for the most part a great time, and clumsily engineered ending aside, a worthy addition to the Horizon series. After the conclusion of the main campaign, this DLC summons you to LA in order to hunt down a lead that may be helpful against the looming threat introduced at the end of Forbidden West's story. The titular Burning Shores are an archipelago roughly four times the size of the San Francisco area of the main map, and shares a lot of that region’s visual identity. It’s a smart decision to echo Forbidden West's standout location – the sand still sparkles and water glistens – but here lava flows in a natural representation of the increased danger that lurks in the Burning Shores. It wastes no time in throwing you into that danger, either, plunging you straight back into the rousing rhythms of Horizon combat.  At first, I found myself scrambling in the sand to rediscover half-buried techniques such as whipping into the air and slowing down time, but quickly got back in the zone, shifting styles like the tectonic plates sliding beneath me. Burning Shores doesn’t hang about when introducing new methods of machine destruction either, such as explosive crystals that cause ruins to collapse onto nearby enemies. Due to the clustered island nature of this new area, the level design tends to naturally create large, contained spaces that are perfect as action-filled arenas. The combat encounters that unfold within these spaces feel as accomplished as anything Guerrilla has created in the Horizon series yet, with a great variety of enemies paired together and environments filled with opportunity. A few new threats join the party to further enhance that mechanical menagerie, including the buzzing, flying ant-like Stingspawn and my favourite, the colossal, acid-spewing Bilegut: a leaping mecha-toad that is a terrific challenge to take down. An exciting new weapon is introduced to your arsenal to even the odds, too. I won't spoil what it is here, but it's a highly enjoyable and delightfully powerful addition that I quickly became reliant on in later battles. It's joined by fresh abilities added to the skill tree, some of which are fantastically effective and – crucially – fun to use. The grapple critical strike solves the formerly lingering problem of dispatching downed-but-distant enemies, and one of the new Valor Surge ultimate abilities causes gleeful chaos by sending surrounding machines into a berserker mode that forces them into a frenzy against one another. The depiction of the city itself is stunning and further reinforces Forbidden West as one of the very best-looking games out there. Some landmarks still stand, such as the crumbling husk of the Capitol Records Building where the only music being made these days is a clanging mashup of metal and electronic as machines whirr and crackle. The new surroundings aren't just lovely to look at but supply fun new gameplay quirks too. Fizzing geysers offer the chance to glide high into the air, making for an effective option in combat as you swoop over unsuspecting threats. Ballistas are used for their puzzle-solving abilities as much as their destructive ones as you create new paths in cliffs with their bolts. It's this smart deployment of equipment with multiple varying uses that serves as a further display of the clever level design (ending aside) on display here. The majority of the fights are a thrill, which makes it a deflating anticlimax when, in its big moments, Burning Shores falls a bit flat. An arrow-sponge boss battle midway through its five-hour story is a particular annoyance, for example. Then there's the huge-scale final encounter, where the clunky action just can't match the spectacle as you're bounced around the arena like a ragdoll while trying to find damage-dealing windows. A stuttering sin when compared to Horizon’s trademark fluid combat, it's a disappointing finale that feels at odds with most of Burning Shores' runtime. This is a fun adventure that ends with a clumsy thud both mechanically and in the story, which does fall foul of some of Horizon's sci-fi trappings. However, it never forgets to focus on the humanity of the situation, further fleshing out Aloy as an endearing and relatable character. The advancement of her character arc comes primarily thanks to the introduction of Seyka – someone similarly insular to Aloy – and the duo helps each other unlock themselves. Seyka proves a valuable companion not only in combat, but also by easing the plot burden from Aloy – crucially giving her someone to talk with and, mercifully, less time telling you about what she's putting in her stash. The returning Ashly Burch is as good as ever as Aloy, but special mention has to go out to Kylie Liya Page as Seyka, who does a fantastic job at creating an engaging and believable three-dimensional character in a relatively short amount of time. A triumphant combination of enthralling combat, top-tier creature and character design, and a captivating open world, Horizon Forbidden West is an absolute blast and fantastic showcase for the power of the PS5. Although the return of a couple of familiar series trappings and a noticeable lack of freeform climbing never threatens to derail the enjoyment, it does leave it falling frustratingly short of something revolutionary. Major evolutionary steps have firmly been placed in the right direction, however, and there’s no doubting the many, many hours of fun to have with Aloy, who stakes her claim further to be one of this generation of gaming’s greatest characters. Guerrilla has outdone itself yet again with Forbidden West, and at this trajectory, neither the horizon nor the sky's the limit for what could come next. There are some great scenes between the two scattered throughout, both quiet and loud, with some highlights once again being when Horizon turns its lens towards our history through its old-world architecture. One area in particular is a delight as the amusement park-like veins that run through LA are re-exposed hundreds of years later. The two lead characters are cut from the same cloth – both outsiders who've learned to be part of a bigger whole – leading to a fun dynamic between the pair as they navigate the Burning Shores together. If Forbidden West was all about Aloy learning to work with others, then Burning Shores feasts on the fruits of those efforts thanks to her competitive, but gradually softening dynamic with Seyka. There will no doubt be discussions surrounding how their chapter together ends, but I felt it was largely in keeping with what we’ve learned about Aloy as a character over the series, even if this particular finish line does seem to have been rushed toward ever so slightly. Burning Shores is essentially one long side quest, which isn't necessarily a bad thing as similar diversions were some of Forbidden West's high points, but sometimes it does struggle to balance character development with feeling like a worthy bridge to the inevitable sequel. It does play stage for a new BioShock-flavoured villain who is a mustache-twiddle away from a cliché, and they don't really get enough screen time to come across as too significant a threat, but do manage to leave a charismatic mark on the story, nonetheless. Despite the villain’s slight impact, Burning Shores does ultimately feel like an essential chapter of Aloy’s story, just not necessarily one to the world of Horizon as a whole. Of course, there are side quests within this side quest, too. Each is often tied to personal stories of intrigue or anguish delivered by the once again solid supporting cast. As with the main game, there is a welcome amount of depth to be found in these with the character and costume design on show is once again best-in-class, with no detail spared. Horizon Forbidden West’s Burning Shores DLC is a worthwhile addition to this acclaimed action-heavy sci-fi series. Fun new challenges and enemies are introduced and cool new ways to dispatch them are presented with regularity. The story is more concerned with developing character than it is working towards dealing with the imminent world-ending threat, and it’s Aloy at her most personal and believable yet. A couple of poor boss battles aside, it’s a great new chapter with enough creative new bells and whistles to keep fans more than happy. "
64,Minecraft Legends ,7.0,"A good strategy game is ultimately one about choice. Which units to create, where to allocate resources, which strategies to implement. The right decisions lead to victory, while the wrong ones force you to adapt and adjust or else suffer bitter defeat. I found myself at the crossroads of these decisions time and again as I played Minecraft Legends, Mojang and Blackbird Interactive's simplified take on an action-RTS. It doesn’t always do a perfect job opening the door of this often intimidating genre to a wider audience, but the way it largely manages to streamline things without losing most of those important tactical moments is what makes Minecraft Legends work. Simplicity is one of Minecraft Legends greatest strengths. Evil Piglins from the Nether are invading, because that's what evil Piglins do, and it’s your job to build up the forces needed to drive them back. You’ll do that by exploring a procedurally generated continent for resources, allies, and secrets to discover, destroying Piglin bases and defending friendly settlements from the invaders as you do. There are no levels, and the minimalistic story is mostly just cutscenes announcing the arrival of larger Piglin forces. Once you’ve cleared all the Piglins out, victory is yours, and you can start another run from scratch on a brand new map.  Minecraft’s iconic blocky style has been well established across its many spin-offs and adaptations by now, but it's still extremely well implemented here. The entire world looks like it was pulled straight from the main Minecraft series, with landscapes, NPCs, and blocks of ore that are identical to their counterparts. It all looks great thanks to a vibrant color palette and some excellent lighting – as is Minecraft tradition, nights bring added danger from aggressive enemies, but it's hard to dread their arrival when it’s preceded by gorgeous sunsets over stunning vistas. Unlike Starcraft or Command and Conquer, where you occupy the seat of some far off overseer commanding a complex legion of forces from above that landscape, Legends puts on you the field of battle directly similar to the Overlord series, giving you control of a warrior fighting alongside a small squad of summonable units. There's a handful of interesting unit types, each with a very clear niche that they fill. Cobblestone Golems have a lot of health but aren’t great at dealing damage quickly, Plank Golems are the opposite, Mossy Golems heal, etc. The fact that it is so straightforward is great, as it makes it easy to jump right into the action without a steep learning curve or thick manual to memorize. The commands you give your soldiers tend to boil down to ""go kill things over there"" or ""follow me"" and are equally easy to issue whether you’re using a gamepad or mouse controls. That’s partly thanks to armies being made of dozens of units rather than hundreds, which keeps things manageable. It’s genuinely fun to smash the gate of a Piglin Fort and send in a horde of your own to run roughshod over everything in its path. There are some drawbacks to that simplicity, however. In theory, certain units work great as counters to specific enemies – Skeleton Archers, for example, should be the go-to choice for dealing damage to the massive flail-wielding Portal Guards from a distance. But abundant resources and the ability to instantly spawn forces sometimes makes it easier to just overwhelm enemies with pure numbers, taking a lot of the thought out of certain battles. It’s also disappointing that there’s no way to create battle groups of specific units – you can command all of a certain unit type at once, but not custom groups of mixed troops. It would have been great fun to be able to quickly issue orders to a squad of damage spongy zombies mixed with healing units to push the front line, supporting them with a group of archers protected by Plank Golems raining pain upon the Piglins. But that level of fine control isn’t really feasible, and that’s a shame. Fortunately, the fact that you participate directly in battles brings with it a chance to make some clever choices. As the hero, you are significantly more powerful than any individual soldier in your army, always mounted and armed with a sword that swings in wide arcs. This opens up opportunities to do things like create swarms of Cobblestone Golems for an invasion, then tell them to focus on destroying buildings while you protect them, or send units to guard one side of a friendly settlement while you cover the other. It’s the kind of mental push-pull that makes strategy games so much fun. This wouldn’t be a Minecraft game without gathering resources and building, and that’s translated in a slick and intuitive way. Allays are small fairy-like creatures that assist with these tasks – one type focuses on resource gathering, letting you point them at a grove of trees or a quarry filled with ore and strip the resources completely independently, while the other carries out building instructions, quickly assembling structures like golem spawners or arrow towers, provided the resources are available. It’s an exceptionally easy system to use that works in a very natural way, letting you go from idea to construction with just two button presses or mouse clicks. The Piglin army will attack a settlement most nights, with each new assault highlighted on the world map, but quickly assembling walls and gates to hold them back is a breeze thanks to those industrious Allays. Figuring out the best way to build each base is a lot of fun – adding structures like an Architect Hut to repair buildings or a Masonry to convert wooden defensive structures to stone is a constant drain on resources, but they can lead to a much more fortified town that’s better able to withstand the rampaging armies of the Nether. The choice of whether to forage for more resources to keep building or hunker down for the coming battle is compelling, and I relished each opportunity to make and execute a plan. The independent operation of your Allays feeds into the strategy elements of combat in interesting ways, too. I would often find myself defending a settlement from an invading force of Piglins and command walls be built as I fought. If wood supplies ran low, I would have to ride to a nearby forest and start the collection process, letting both sets of Allays work while I continued the fight. But Piglins will go out of their way to target the fragile Allays, keeping this mid-battle backup from being too overpowered by forcing me to think twice before leaving them unprotected. A structure called the Well of Fates acts as your primary home base. This is where you start, the default respawn location when you die, and where you do most of your upgrading. Destroyed Piglin structures drop Prismarine, which is used to construct upgrade structures that allow you to do things like command more troops or store more materials in general. There’s a limited number of places these can be built, and I found myself sweating the decisions about whether to increase the size of my army, open up opportunities to mine specialty ores like coal and redstone, or add more Allays to expedite resource gathering. The Piglins themselves don’t sit on their hands (hooves?) waiting for you to build up armies to come smash them, either. They produce bases and outposts of their own, with increasing complexity as time goes on. What begins as some quick pillaging of a few buildings at the start eventually becomes long sieges of intricate fortresses that can take multiple in-game days. Whether to press the advantage or turn your attention toward defending vulnerable areas elsewhere is a constant mental struggle that creates a nice sense of tension. Unfortunately, the difficulty curve has a few kinks in it. The last few hours of my 16-hour playthrough slowed to a crawl as enemies with massive amounts of health joined the fray, like the heavily armored Pigmadillos. It’s great that enemies with unique designs and attacks still continue to show up, but the size of the armies they fill becomes a slog. This is an even bigger problem when attacking an enemy base on a high plateau – assembling an attack force only to realize half of them fell off a cliff on the march up due to suspect pathfinding is frustrating. Legends loses some of its potential as an onboarding opportunity for the strategy genre because of these endgame struggles. There is a premium currency that can be purchased with real world money in Minecraft Legends. There will be cosmetic items and new “experiences” available, but nothing that affects the competitive multiplayer landscape or player progress. The experiences will be tied to either Lost Legends and Myths. Lost Legends are free, and represent monthly challenges for players that give as-of-yet undisclosed rewards upon completion. Myths, on the other hand, will be set up similar to the Minecraft Marketplace available in Minecraft Bedrock, where partnered creators earn revenue by creating paid experiences that players can opt into purchasing. Time will tell how well the system works, but on paper it’s fairly innocuous as far as microtransactions go. Fortunately, good construction options can mitigate some of those pain points. Siege tools like the Redstone Launcher, which acts somewhat like a long range cannon fixture, can help clear a landing point, and crafting bridges or stairs to cross gaps and ascend hills is a snap. The Cure Netherrack ability that slowly transforms the corrupted ground under Piglin bases is a standout difference maker, too, allowing the assembly of buildings and golem spawners inside enemy territory. These are fun ways to turn the tide, but it can be a little uncharacteristically daunting that making the most of every single tool in your belt feels like the only viable option to clear the highest level outposts. Minecraft Legends is fun solo, but it excels in multiplayer. The entire campaign can be played in co-op with up to three other friends, where resources are split but everyone has full autonomy to act independently. Dividing tasks like resource gathering, base building, and combat alleviates many frustrations, and it’s just a lot of fun to charge into battle with your allies. It’s the best way to play, and sharing the elation of victory with friends doesn’t get old. PVP, meanwhile, has an interesting wrinkle to it: two teams go head-to-head on a randomized map,  with players on each team controlling a hero while sharing resources and golems. Matchmade games are designed for 3v3 or 4v4, but private games can have any mix of up to four players on either side. One game my team worked to destroy Piglin bases early so we could afford upgrades quickly, focusing on making the most powerful army possible before clashing with other humans. Another game we were wiped out when our opponents stealthily built a Redstone Launcher within range of our base, focusing almost entirely on defending that while it crushed our structures. The strategic elements that other humans can bring are much more interesting than facing the CPU. Minecraft Legends is an engaging strategy game that does a great job streamlining a notoriously complex genre without sacrificing the ever-important element of choice and consequence. That said, some genre staples like assigning custom groups of units are casualties of this simplification, which is too bad because it does limit your strategic options a bit in the heat of battle. But Legends uses other recognizable elements like its worker unit Allays to great effect, and it nails the iconic Minecraft aesthetic with some of the best looking blocks around. The difficulty curve does have the potential to make the late game frustrating, but stellar cooperative and PVP play still make this RTS very worthwhile. "
65,Mighty Doom ,5.0,"Doom has been many things over the years — a pioneering first-person shooter, an RPG, even a board game — but Mighty Doom is the first time this franchise has been cute. Your cartoonish Slayer in this mobile top-down shooter is just as adorable as the chonky cacodemons and prowlers with pinchable cheeks he is mutilating. The whole thing starts out as a lively single-stick roguelite that has you marching through demon-packed levels toward… well, I’m not exactly sure. I never saw the end of it, because a hellish difficulty spike clearly designed to bully me into spending real money on in-game power Glory Killed any desire I had to keep playing. There’s a fun, fast-paced, delightfully gory game in here, but it’s chained to a mountain of free-to-play garbage that leaches the fun out of the experience once you reach a certain point. The result is a monetized nightmare that feels less like Doom and more like Candy Crush Saga with Hell Priests. You control your Doom Slayer using an onscreen joystick, but shooting is automatic. That means all you have to do is move around the arena-like stages avoiding enemies, projectiles, and environmental dangers like spikes and saw blades. You also have a couple of slots for special weapons, like a rocket launcher and BFG, that you can deploy with the press of a button after a cooldown period. The touchscreen controls aren’t super precise, which becomes a problem when the screen is filled with enemies and bullets later on, but they’re mostly adequate in earlier levels. Doom isn't the first major game series to get a mobile port awash in distracting monetization recently, here's what we said about 2022's Diablo Immortal. There’s so much to like about Diablo Immortal that it really pains me to see it so close and yet so far from being a game I can heartily recommend. As a casual, purely free-to-play experience it offers a lot to do, with its empowering ARPG combat and interesting skill system, whereas for those that want to be competitive in PVP it quickly becomes restrictive, punitive, and money-grubbing. And for everyone in between? It just doesn’t offer good value for money spent. If the Empowered Battle Pass and Boon of Plenty offered more, I could definitely see myself renewing them each season and steadily working my way through the many difficulty levels as I ascend Immortal’s 600 paragon levels, and gradually – oh so gradually – ranking up my legendary gems. Instead, that dream is so far out of reach that it’s not feasible, and the further in I get the less the rewards offered by those paid services are actually likely to be meaningful. I’m still going to keep playing Diablo Immortal, but without overhauls to the monetisation and the many restrictions, it’s going to be a dip in, dip out game, as opposed to a world I want to live in. As a roguelite, you start each run with only the persistent gear you’ve equipped between levels, but you’ll earn lots of temporary upgrades as you slay demons mid-run to increase your combat capabilities. This is incredibly empowering, as toward the end of a run you might be double-firing spread-shot rounds that bounce off walls and ricochet from one enemy to the next, while lobbing grenades with upgraded splash damage. These upgrades go away at the end of each run, but they make Mighty Doom exciting and rewarding on a moment-by-moment basis. Most levels are made up of 40 stages roughly the size of tennis courts, with bosses to take down every 10. Bosses are big, souped-up versions of standard enemies like imps, soldiers, revenants, and prowlers, but they have their own unique attacks and patterns, so they feel fresh — at least the first few times you encounter them. The enemy variety in the levels mostly works well, too, with weaker pawn-like foes up front, sturdier tank enemies in the middle, and ranged opponents in the back. Your demon-slaying runs are accompanied by a heavy-metal soundtrack that sounds like it was pulled straight from recent Doom games, too, giving the whole thing a boost of intensity as the announcer growls the names of your upgrades in a delightfully over-the-top manner. Take all that together and I had a lot of fun in my first few hours with Mighty Doom. After one run, I always wanted to start another to see if I could get closer to beating whatever level I died on. During those early hours, I could make progress at a reasonable rate as well — I might die on a stage 10 boss, but I’d be able to make it several stages deeper the next time after upgrading my Slayer between runs. I was somewhere in level four when I hit a steep difficulty spike that halted my progress like a BFG blast to the chest. Two things happened: first, the enemies became noticeably more powerful, draining big chunks of my health with a single blow. On top of that, the number of enemies on screen in some levels increased to the point where it could be difficult to tell what was even happening. I’d find projectiles flying at me from all directions, pinkies and lost souls charging in from offscreen, and revenants dropping down to lob missiles at my face. I’d often see my health bar draining and have no idea what was even hitting me. After struggling to make any headway for a while, I spent $15 on in-app purchases to upgrade my equipment — both because it seemed like the only option I hadn’t tried to make progress, and because I wanted to see if my growing pay-to-win suspicions were correct. The boost that money provided did get me through level four, but not much further. Level five introduces waves of enemies, while also giving those enemies another enormous power boost. That’s when Mighty Doom started to feel downright unfair, and the emphasis it put on its purchasable loot boxes meant the difficulty struck me less as a balance miscalculation and more of an unspoken paywall. Whether you want to spend a whole lot of time throwing yourself against this frustrating and repetitive challenge or a whole lot of money to make it slightly more reasonable, you aren’t going to get past this point without jumping through even more free-to-play hoops. And Mighty Doom has free-to-play hoops galore. You have an avalanche of currencies to keep track of: unique keys for each equipment type (there are eight), energy, coins, and crystals, the last two of which can be purchased with real money. You have to spend five energy to start a run and you can only carry 20, which means you can’t always dive into another run when you want to. Your energy replenishes slowly over time, but of course you can speed it up by spending crystals. You can also spend crystals to buy loot boxes to increase your Slayer’s power, but the number of crystals required to open a loot box with a chance of containing a rare or epic item is steep. Each piece of gear can be upgraded dozens of times by spending coins and equipment keys, but individual improvements are barely noticeable. Coins can be used to upgrade a random core stat, or “mastery,” but after hitting the difficulty spike, those power boosts felt inadequate as well. Other monetization options include purchasing new Slayer skins and weapon skins, using either crystals or real money directly depending on the item. You can even spend crystals to revive your Slayer once mid-run. And, to get even better gear as you play, you can purchase a battle pass for $6.99. Basically, whatever aggravating monetization scheme you may have heard about in the last decade is probably here. The one alternative to spending in-game currency is spending your real-life time watching ads. You can watch an ad to avoid paying to revive (this is a limited privilege, I discovered). You can also watch an ad to open a very basic type of loot crate containing coins or common gear. And while you can earn the currencies just by playing, it’s never enough to make much of a difference after that level four difficulty spike. No matter what I did, I never had the currency needed to make progress at a reasonable pace unless I was willing to open my wallet. Trying to wrap my head around all the free-to-play junk surrounding the basic game felt like I was studying for the Bar Exam. I understand some of this monetization is necessary, or at least accepted as common practice for many mobile games these days, especially free ones. But buying skins or a battle pass in Fortnite or Marvel Snap feels different. Those games are centered around multiplayer, and showing off your favorite cosmetic upgrades at least seems to serve a purpose — plus they’re easy to ignore if that’s not your thing. Mighty Doom is a single-player game, so you don’t have anyone to impress with your new Slayer skins except yourself. And paying for power upgrades to complete a level you’re stuck on due to an artificially punishing difficulty spike is the very definition of pay-to-win. There is a devilishly fun roguelite hiding in Mighty Doom, but the way it’s been buried under all the most egregious money-making schemes in mobile gaming is hugely disappointing. I enjoyed the first few hours, when monsters posed an entertaining challenge I could satisfyingly overcome, and I would probably be happy to recommend it if Bethesda had balanced all nine levels to match. But it’s not long before a super-powered difficulty spike meant my Slayer’s defense and damage output just couldn’t keep up — at least, not without opening my wallet. Even when you do, this invisible paywall and the free-to-play speed bumps that accompany it turn Mighty Doom into a teeth-grindingly frustrating experience that made me want to delete the app entirely rather than pay to upgrade my Slayer enough to progress. "
66,sident Evil 4 ,10.0,"In light of the high-quality remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3 released in 2019 and 2020, it felt like a safe bet that Capcom would do an equally admirable job of rebuilding Resident Evil 4. Even so, when I hit the start button on this 2023 remake of the legendary 2005 action-horror game I wasn’t prepared for how forcefully it would knock my knees out from under me and suplex me headfirst into 16 hours of sustained tension and exhilaration. This fully revitalised campaign dramatically one-ups the original in almost every conceivable way. Its Spanish countryside setting is substantially more sinister, its pacing has been tightened to the point where hardly a single minute is wasted, and its controls have been modernised in order to allow its signature dynamic shooting mechanics to really shine. I’ve been waiting 18 years for a game to thrill me in the same way as Resident Evil 4; as it turns out, this whole time I’ve just been waiting for another Resident Evil 4. The original Resident Evil 4 is a landmark installment in Capcom’s seminal survival-horror series that, for many, would need no introduction. However, considering it came out back when we assumed that Episode III would be the last Star Wars film and iPhones didn’t even exist yet, I should probably give it some context. At the time it was a big deal for Resident Evil to switch from the series’ traditional fixed-camera perspectives to a then radical over-the-shoulder viewpoint that brought us uncomfortably close to the gore and put the emphasis on reflexes and precision targeting, and as a result Resident Evil 4 was an action-horror epic without peer. Its influence has subsequently been felt in countless other third-person classics like Gears of War, Dead Space, and The Last of Us, and now its original DNA has been extracted, synthesised, and injected into a state-of-the-art host game, mutating it into a menacing new monster that's breathtaking to behold and immensely intimidating to encounter.  In preparation for this review I returned to the original game for the first time in years and was shocked at how badly this remake was needed. The movement of main star Leon Kennedy felt ridiculously restricted; he struggles to get around as though he’s wearing an old pair of skinny jeans that haven’t fit him since his police academy days, and is immobilised anytime he gets his gun out as though he’s incapable of independent control over his hands and feet at the same time. By modern standards it’s absurd, and would absolutely put off a lot of newcomers before they could begin to understand why this game is so highly regarded. Thankfully, those days are gone. Not unlike the recent Metroid Prime Remastered, this Resident Evil 4 remake plays like a 2023 game. Luxuries like simultaneous twin-stick movement and targeting mean that you can cautiously back away while still keeping your gun trained on the advancing hordes, or side-step out of the way of an incoming crossbow bolt without having to remove your eye from the scope of your rifle. This newfound freedom of movement makes you better equipped to really make the most of the immensely satisfying area-specific damage effects; blowing kneecaps out to expose an enemy to a melee finisher, blasting sticks of dynamite held in the hands of attackers before they have a chance to throw them, or simply reveling in some of the grisliest headshots in the history of video game shotguns. None of this will shock you if you never played the original, but trust me, it’s a big deal to those of us who are back for round two: the rough edges of a number of other interactions have been filed down, like how crates and barrels can be quickly smashed at the tap of a button rather than having to clumsily line up a knife swing, making it much faster to scramble for ammo and health pickups in the heat of a battle. Weapon switching is now performed instantly with a tap of the D-pad rather than having to pause to hop in and out of the inventory screen, and Leon’s combat knife can also be used to parry enemy attacks or bring a swift finish to staggered foes, or to take enemies out silently after he’s crept up on them with his new ability to crouch. (It must be those looser fitting jeans).  Crucially, though, this overhauled control setup makes combat more enjoyably fluid without compromising any of the challenge when played on the Hardcore setting recommended for returning players. (‘Standard’ and ‘Assisted’ modes are included if you want an easier time of it.) The added benefits of the knife are balanced by the fact that it takes damage with each use, so you can only rely on it sparingly – otherwise it will break like a tiny Master Sword and must be repaired at a merchant before you can resume stabbing. Meanwhile, enemies move in dangerously erratic ways and have a tendency to quickly overwhelm in numbers, so you still have to make snap decisions when it comes to prioritising targets. They’ve also learnt a few cunning new tricks to trip you up with, like the sneaky way the homicidal villagers will lay down bear traps in the middle of a fight to keep you on your toes while you’re busy flexing your trigger finger. Resident Evil 4 may well give you a more expansive toolset to aid Leon’s survival, but you still need to keep your wits and reflexes sharp – because losing your head amidst a crowd crawling with a murderous mind-controlling parasite can swiftly result in Leon literally losing his. Thankfully, a new checkpoint save system minimises any arduous backtracking from your last manual typewriter save should Leon perish – but purists should take note that the unlockable Professional difficulty mode removes that safety net if you prefer a more punishing run the next time through. No matter what difficulty you choose, a major strength of Resident Evil 4 is that enemy types are continually shuffled so that you can never really settle into a one-size fits all strategy. Just as you’re comfortably pulling off headshots, they start wearing helmets to force you to target their legs. Then, once you’ve busted more kneecaps than a debt collector, they start coming back to life with deadly whipping tendrils sprouting out of their shoulders. Then, when you’ve figured out how to take out these terrifying mutations efficiently, you come face to face with a seemingly unstoppable waddling tub of nightmare fuel that can regenerate every blown off body part like a T-1000 that was hand-sculpted by Clive Barker. Resident Evil 4 gives you a growing number of guns that all feel great to use, from submachine guns to rocket launchers and the especially powerful magnums, and does its absolute best to ensure you’re leaving very little in the chamber after each frenzied firefight. I also love how the tactile nature of almost every element in your surroundings can be used as a tactical advantage, provided you can think fast enough on your feet. The chainsaw attacks from the terrifying, sack-hooded Dr. Salvador are just as deadly to Leon as they are to every other enemy in the vicinity, so baiting him into lunging at you and then steering him into a crowd of his own minions is a great way to thin the herd. Meanwhile, dangling oil lanterns can be shot and dropped onto an angry mob to set them all ablaze, but they can also be used to ignite hapless animals like cows who will rage out of control and scorch everyone in their path. When ammunition is always at a premium, it’s both practical and ridiculously entertaining to let a flaming hunk of hamburger do your dirty work. Many of you under 30 might have no clue what Resident Evil 4 is about: it’s perhaps best described as riding a rollercoaster that’s careening off the rails to crash through a row of spectacular haunted houses. What starts as a fairly straightforward rescue mission, with Leon sent into a small Spanish village in search of the US President’s missing daughter Ashley, soon hurtles into a heart-stopping series of battles against giant sea monsters and towering trolls, desperate defenses against crazed hordes in boarded up cabins, outrageous assaults on a heavily fortified castle, skulking sections through shadowy laboratories, explosive minecart chases, and countless run-ins with some truly twisted freaks infected with the mutating Las Plagas parasite, all of which look consistently incredible reimagined on Capcom’s RE Engine (which also powered the last two remakes). The original RE4’s famously flabby final third has been tightened up considerably, and it all builds towards an improved and genuinely imposing final boss fight that took all of my skill and ammo reserves to topple. Of equal importance to its renovated environments and enemies is the anxiety-inducing audio design. It can’t be overstated how effective the sounds of Resident Evil 4 are when it comes to cultivating a genuine sense of dread. Whether it’s the manic chanting of its parasite-riddled peasant farmers when you enter a new area, the snarl of wolves as they whip through the leaves around you in the castle’s hedge maze, or the throaty rumble of a chainsaw motor idling in the distance, just listening to it all routinely had me inching towards the edge of my seat in anticipation for each enemy encounter, so when the the carnage kicked off and the tension spiked I had hardly any couch left to cling to. At every step of the journey there are enhancements, both big and small. The original’s gimmicky, quicktime-event-heavy knife battle against Major Krauser has been transformed into a gripping blend of parries and counter-attacks, while the frustration of escorting Ashley through certain sections has been reduced significantly by ditching her health bar so you don’t need to waste valuable green herbs on healing her, and her intelligence has been improved so she’s less prone to foolishly stumble into the hands of a bloodthirsty mob. Elsewhere, there have been considerable structural changes that make the environment feel more cohesive. For instance, in the original game the lake area primarily served as the backdrop to a boss fight, but now you can fully explore the lake and its surroundings by boat, docking at various inlets to scour cabins and caves for additional puzzles, valuable treasures, and hidden horrors lying in wait. With Resident Evil 4, Capcom has successfully – triumphantly – taken the franchise to the next level. It's really emphasized the ""survival"" in survival horror, too. You're oftentimes on the run for your life. And villagers, much smarter than any zombie, team up, dodge bullets, and do other nasty things that I will let you discover on your own. Then there are the boss fights, which are unexpectedly brilliant. This game is extremely scary, and that fear is intensified by the best graphics and some of the most eerie audio on Nintendo's console. When you add in the new camera and action systems, as well as Leon's excellent new analog targeting function, you have a completely transformed survival horror experience. One that eclipses everything before it. Indeed, even after 20-plus hours of non-stop thrills, you won't want to put the controller down. In fact, despite having played the original several times over, there still seemed to be something that surprised me around each and every corner, and the pacing of Leon’s plight never gets bogged down in the sort of storytime stroll that’s become so common in a lot of big-budget single-player adventures. With all due respect to the likes of The Last of Us and God of War Ragnarok – which are both excellent in their own ways – Resident Evil 4 has no time for dialogue-heavy deep and meaningfuls. Leon’s foppish haircut might scream noughties emo but his stoic attitude is all-out ‘80s action hero, and no matter how much I had to Tetris-swap the expanding selection of guns and ammo to fit his inventory case he always seemed to have plenty of room left up his sleeve for a winking one-liner to whip out after a thoroughly insane action sequence before sliding a fresh clip into his submachine gun and running headlong into the next. When you do need to take a breather, the mysterious merchant returns to keep Leon topped up with a suite of dangerous devices like a quaint form of Q Branch, along with new recipes that allow you to craft the exact ammo types you want when out in the world rather than having to rely on randomised drops. He also pays the bounties on the optional side quests that have been added throughout the campaign, like shooting down hidden blue medallions or tracking down a rare golden chicken egg, which proved to be fun little diversions away from the story’s murderous main path. These bounties are paid in spinel gemstones which can be traded for unique items and upgrades outside of his standard inventory of wares, so although I was initially sad to see the iconic red dot sight removed from Leon’s starting pistol, it only took me a few short quests to be able to buy one and satisfyingly fit it myself. One thing in particular that I appreciate about the remake’s merchant is that he’s a lot more generous when it comes to the trade-in value of your weapons. In the original it never really made sense to invest too heavily in upgrading the base pistol and shotgun early on, only for their value to drop dramatically when it came time to trade up for some beefier boomsticks. However, in the remake you’re effectively refunded close to the full value of each weapon along with the cost of any upgrades you’ve added to it, so you can re-spec your favourite guns and boost them towards their optimal forms without copping as big a penalty to your purse of Spanish pesetas. The merchant also gives you access to the new bolt thrower weapon during your first encounter, and its reusable bolts come in handy in the story’s early hours when you’re still finding your feet as far as managing ammunition reserves and crafting resources goes. Yet despite his generous prices and fabulous wares, I couldn’t help but feel a little shortchanged after each transaction; his re-recorded dialogue isn’t delivered with quite the same kind of goofy charm as that of the grizzled original. However, in the scheme of things it says a lot for the overall quality of this remake when the only minor black mark I can give it is for its slightly blander black market dealer – and if this is your first time playing it won’t bother you in the slightest. It’s also a shame that The Mercenaries mode isn’t included at launch, although it’s reassuring to know that it will be coming as part of a free update sometime in the future, and I’m extremely keen to tackle its frantic time attack challenges with the benefits of Leon’s more malleable move set. In the meantime there’s a New Game+ mode and a lengthy list of in-game challenges to complete in order to unlock additional weapons, costumes, and concept art, though it seems that bonus modes Assignment Ada and Separate Ways that were present in older versions of Resident Evil 4 have either been scrapped or potentially saved for DLC. Their loss isn’t that big of a deal since they were never as huge a draw as The Mercenaries for me personally, but when a campaign is consistently this amazing, it’s hard not to feel greedy for a little bit more. Whether you're a fan of the original or a newcomer with a hankering for some action-heavy horror of the highest quality, Resident Evil 4 is like a parasite-riddled Spaniard: a total no-brainer. Its combat is friction-free but no less stress-inducing thanks to its ferocious cast of creatures, its story rapidly shuttles through a series of action scenes that are diverse in structure but uniformly unwavering in intensity, and its world is rich in detail and full of fun and often snarling surprises. Its improvements over the original are too numerous to list, from simple quality of life changes to completely overhauled boss fight mechanics, and with the exception of the disappointingly diminished personality of the merchant, the team at Capcom has barely put a foot wrong. Whaddaya buying? Only the most relentlessly exciting Resident Evil adventure of all time that’s been rebuilt, refined, and realised to the full limits of its enormous potential. A wise choice, mate. "
67,Destiny 2: Lightfall Review in Progress,6.0,"On the chitin-covered heels of the impressive Witch Queen expansion and a relatively strong year of live-service support overall, it seemed like Destiny 2 was finally gaining momentum as it headed toward the conclusion of its epic saga. Sadly, my optimism for a game I’ve spent thousands of hours playing has come crashing down like a Cabal drop pod after just a couple dozen with Destiny’s latest expansion, Lightfall. The story is so shockingly incoherent that even someone who has spent countless hours reading Destiny’s lore like I have couldn’t understand its nonsense, the new destination on Neptune feels as lifeless as the real planet, and the endgame/seasonal activities have so few surprises to offer (at least so far) that they give me deja vu in the worst possible way. Thankfully, a number of Lightfall’s activities are challenging enough to warrant me leaning forward in my seat, the new Strand subclass is a nice addition to Destiny’s sandbox, and the most recent batch of quality-of-life improvements largely succeed at making my time shooting space rhinos in the face a less bumpy ride. I still have a little more to do and the eventual raid ahead of me, but so far even Lightfall’s best parts haven’t been able to wash the overwhelming taste of disappointment out of my mouth. The opening moments of Lightfall are some of its best, as Destiny’s long-awaited final villain, The Witness, arrives in our solar system to deal a blow against humanity and our allies. But any excitement is quickly swept into the vacuum of space as you’re bizarrely and inexplicably redirected from the action to take part in a seemingly unrelated sidequest in the Neptunian city of Neomuna. Not only is the story a decidedly low stakes diversion that draws you away from the real conflict happening on Earth, but it flatout does not make sense. That’s not just me saying that, either; some of the Destiny community’s greatest lore minds have been completely stumped by the utter nonsense of Lightfalls’s story.  Lightfall also launches alongside some seasonal content for the Season of Defiance, which takes place in the aftermath of the events of Lightfall as humanity defends Earth from the ongoing invasion and has you running around with Mara Sav doing chores for her. Season of Defiance isn’t a part of Lightfall, but is being bundled with most versions of the expansion and so warrants limited consideration for this review. From what I’ve seen so far, this content is very much in line with what we’ve seen before and won’t likely move the needle for me either way. We’ve got a weekly ritual, a 3-person activity to grind out, and some new weapons and armor to play with, but no major surprises beyond that. As this season will take place over the course of the next few months, it remains to be seen if any curveballs will be thrown our way, but I certainly wouldn’t hold my breath. The events on Neomuna surround a macguffin called The Veil, a mysterious artifact that you’re told is super important, but nobody ever, ever tells you what it is or its purpose, even a little bit – ever. Your enemy is Calus, a stack of pancakes cosplaying as an air fryer, who serves as the least intimidating antagonist in Destiny’s history. As you wage war against an incompetent moron for control of an artifact you know nothing about, you’ll also discover the dark powers of Strand, a green elemental subclass our heroes spend half of the campaign trying to figure out how to use in a process so dull they literally skip over some of it by giving you a Rocky-style training montage at one point. Yikes. Along the way, you also meet the Cloud Striders, Nimbus and Rohan, who are 12-foot tall cybernetically infused humanoids with personalities that were apparently drawn randomly from a basket of cliches. Rohan is an elderly Cloud Strider who all-but stares directly into the camera to tell you he’s a day away from retirement (I wonder what will happen to him), while Nimbus is a young surfer dude who makes cringey jokes as humanity’s holocaust unfolds. Staying on brand with the rest of the campaign, the writing for these two is so extraordinarily bad it makes interacting with them a painful chore, especially Nimbus, who manages to make the low stakes of Lightfall’s story feel even more laughable with their irritating adolescent hijinks. Just as quickly as it began, the story wraps up a mere 8 hours later while resolving none of its greater questions and kicking the can down the road for any actual story developments to be dealt with at a later date, neatly putting all the pieces back exactly where they were at the beginning. The storytelling is so dreadful it makes me nostalgic for the days of the infamous “I don’t have time to explain why I don’t have time to explain” line uttered in vanilla Destiny – but worse than that, it undermines the approaching finale by trivializing the arrival of The Witness and slamming the brakes on any momentum or goodwill Destiny gained from The Witch Queen’s excellent writing. As a longtime Destiny fan, I was utterly heartbroken by both the disappointing whiplash in quality and all the wasted story potential by the time I finished Lightfall’s campaign. It’s not just the plot that disappoints, either. The levels themselves feel decidedly less unique or memorable than The Witch Queen. The interesting puzzles and diet raid mechanics featured in last year’s campaign have been replaced with irritating battles taking place in an arena where you’re often running in circles to survive, stopping to take shots here and there while you can. Instead of fighting interesting new enemies like the light-bearing Hive, Lightfall has you mostly fighting the same burly Cabal that we’ve been at war with for nine years, which have always been one of Destiny’s less engaging adversaries. Strand does at least help ease the monotony of the campaign’s action, representing the biggest shakeup to Destiny’s sandbox in a long while. The powers themselves aren’t revolutionary to Destiny: you get a new melee ability, new supers for each class that deal huge DPS, and some new buffs and debuffs to play with – like Suspend, which lifts enemies off the ground and entangles them briefly, or Sever, which causes the enemy’s damage output to become significantly reduced. Admittedly, these additions aren’t hugely different from what we’ve seen in Destiny over the years. For example, Suspend effectively does the same thing as the freezing powers of Stasis that we got with Beyond Light. And casting Strand supers to take out large groups of enemies works more-or-less identically to other subclasses but with a different color. But that’s not to say Strand has nothing unique to offer! The main reason to pick it over other classes is in its unmatched mobility, since the subclass replaces your Guardian’s grenade with a grapple hook that allows you to swing around the environment and pull yourself towards enemies to follow up with a devastating melee hit – both of which are a lot of fun. It’s definitely an interesting tradeoff since gaining access to a grapple hook is rarely worth losing a grenade over, but it still adds some much-needed diversity to the sandbox and is a great option to help navigate the vertical nature of Neomuna’s skyscrapers. You’ll be spending most of your time on the neon-soaked streets of Neomuna, a city that’s been peculiarly hidden from the rest of the galaxy until now, yet houses massive buildings and technology that surpasses even that of Guardians during the golden age. Unfortunately, this setting is as flimsy as its lore, and is barren and lifeless despite supposedly thriving up until the recent Cabal invasion. Each area of Neomuna contains a handful of featureless buildings and plenty of Cabal and Vex enemies to battle, but little else to engage with aside from the standard fare of patrols and public events that we’ve seen in every Destiny location since 2014. You might be thinking: “but shouldn’t this thriving city on Neptune be full of people to talk to?” Of course it should, right? It’d be crazy to make the whole thing look like a derelict corporate park with no intelligent life in sight. Well, as you’re conveniently told early in your visit, all of Neomuna’s citizens have been uploaded to a virtual network to achieve immortality, so they only appear around the city as blurry, ghostlike outlines. The only physical beings occupying the meat space of Neomuna are our duo of Cloud Striders, who apparently follow the Sith’s rule of two so there’s no chance of you meeting a third, maybe more interesting character even by accident. Luckily there’s at least one exciting new enemy for you to fight along the way, as Lightfall introduces the Tormentor, a warrior of the darkness who chases you around with a scythe, takes away your abilities with suppression powers, and can nearly one-shot you with his terrifying grapple attack. As the first true footsoldier of the darkness we’ve faced after years of speculation that their pyramid ships would be filled with new horrors for us to confront, the Tormentor serves as a glimmer of hope for what I imagine will be a fully realized enemy faction once we finally face The Witness head-on. But for now they’re one of the only things to occasionally inject some desperately needed freshness into Lightfall’s otherwise stale sandbox. They may be a bit overused in the campaign for that reason, but they are at least a genuinely fun new obstacle to overcome. A less thrilling addition is that Cabal enemies, now infused with the wicked powers of darkness, will frequently drop a shard upon death that grants an overshield to their allies for a long time unless it’s destroyed. While it’s at least a new challenge to contend with, it mostly just causes the flow of combat to grind to a halt every couple of seconds as you’re forced to remove overshields from the enemy before proceeding, only for another shard to drop the next time you kill something. Much of Destiny’s moment-to-moment gameplay remains unchanged with Lightfall, and five years into this sequel that’s a growing problem. If you look at some of my older reviews of Destiny 2’s expansions like Shadowkeep, you might be confused why I called that underwhelming expansion “Good,” while being much more critical about this one. The main reason is that games (and my reviews of them) don’t exist without context – not only are many video games getting more impressive, Destiny specifically has raised the bar on itself over the years, especially with The Witch Queen. What was novel in 2019 has become tiresome four years on, and at this point Destiny’s predictable formula feels worse by its refusal to evolve (or in Lightfall’s case: its insistence on regressing). So while an expansion that’s probably worse than Lightfall by today’s standards genuinely felt good to me several years ago, an expansion that’s similarly disappointing feels downright gut-wrenching in 2023. Once you’ve completed Lightfall’s campaign, you’ll be greeted by the usual post-game quests and busywork that have followed all of Destiny’s recent campaigns. There’s nothing bad about the postgame stuff I’ve played so far, but there’s also nothing super exciting about it. You’ll learn a little more about Neomuna and go on an odyssey to obtain a new exotic weapon, or maybe even grind out some more customization options for the Strand subclass, but nothing I’ve played has made me particularly motivated about continuing to traipse around Neptune. I still have some quests to check off my list before finalizing this review, and am hopeful the raid that debuts on March 10 will prove more entertaining than the rest of my adventure so far. But as of right now, things are looking pretty dire for a game that’s been close to my heart for many years. No doubt Lightfall’s shortcomings are made more painful by immediately following The Witch Queen and its strong post-launch updates, which felt like Destiny 2 had finally overcome its storytelling woes and charted out a strong future for itself. After playing Lightfall, perhaps too fittingly given its name, that future doesn’t look quite as bright.  Destiny 2: Lightfall is a disappointing expansion with a campaign that falls flat on its face, an underwhelming new destination, and only a few new standout activities to take on. That said, Strand and the new Tormentor enemy are fantastic new additions to the sandbox, some of the endgame activities and added difficulty make for a sweaty, memorable time, and per usual, the raid is a complete blast (even if it isn’t their best). No doubt Lightfall’s shortcomings are made more painful by immediately following The Witch Queen and its strong post-launch updates, which felt like Destiny 2 had finally overcome its storytelling woes and charted out a promising future for itself. After playing Lightfall, perhaps too fittingly given its name, that future doesn’t look quite as bright. "
68,Sons of the Forest Early Access ,8.0,"I'll never forget my first confusing, terrifying encounter with a cannibal in 2018's The Forest, when an intelligent creature out of a nightmare decided simply to watch me rather than try to kill me. And while its sequel, Sons of the Forest, can't truly replicate the creepy novelty of that first time, it does build upon the gameplay, story, and atmosphere of one of the best ever survival crafting games in some very satisfying ways. It occasionally reminded me of its Early Access status with seemingly unfinished cutscenes and inconsistent performance, but not nearly as often as a lot of other recent games that use that label. Set several years after The Forest, Sons of the Forest challenges you to survive and uncover new mysteries on a lush, temperate island that reminded me of hiking in the American Pacific Northwest. It's about four times the size of the original's map, and it is downright gorgeous. The amount and variety of vegetation, some of which can be used as a food source or to make medicines, adds a fullness and richness to the landscape that we rarely see in this type of game. The lighting is also incredible. Clouds that partially block out the sun on a warm day completely change the mood of my exploration. It's one of those small details that most games ignore, but when one of them gets it right, I really notice.  I’ve never been terrorized, stalked, or fascinated by enemy AI quite like I was in The Forest. It’s a harrowing survival ordeal that knows how to play with tension and create the sense of a real world with complex inner workings and mysteries I was eager to discover. It’s I Am Legend told in the depths of the hinterlands, with a meaningful story progression that doesn’t overstay its welcome. Disregard the warnings on the walls and hidden between the trees at your own peril – and if you want a unique and memorable survival horror experience, then you should absolutely dare to do so. It isn't perfectly optimized yet though. While my RTX 3080 could generally cruise along at a smooth 60 frames or better at 1080p with DLSS set to maximum quality, I did run into semi-regular dips into the 20s when traveling long distances over land. And you sometimes see annoying pop-in with leaves and rocks appearing a couple dozen meters in front of you, which can really take me out of the experience. I also had a lot of glitchy sound issues, particularly during rainstorms or other times when a lot of different sounds were playing at once. Performance is usually one of the last things to be finalized, though, so hopefully a lot of this can be worked out over the course of Early Access. Further adding to the believability and hostility of the environment in Sons of the Forest is a full system of seasons, including snowy winters that kill off most of the edible vegetation and require you to keep track of your body temperature. It's a nice change of pace, but I think there's more that could be done with these weather effects. Being soaking wet and freezing cold, even on higher difficulties, is more of a small annoyance than a life-threatening challenge. And, hilariously, you can't break the ice on frozen bodies of water, even using C4 explosives. But overall, I enjoyed both the visual variety and shift in difficulty seasons provided quite a bit. Of course, I haven't mentioned the cannibals yet. Much like in the first game, they cleverly subvert everything we've been taught about video game enemies, prioritizing self-preservation over aggression. Every run-in with these bone-clad baddies begins with a tense stand-off, and many will choose not to fight, especially if they're alone and you don't act afraid of them. Their AI has definitely gotten a significant upgrade since The Forest, with improved stealth, more advanced social dynamics, and more varied group behavior. They can climb trees to get away or pounce on you from above, and even set ambushes, disguising themselves in piles of leaves. It's terrifying, especially if you're caught outside at night and you can hear that they're nearby, but you don't know where. I'll let you discover some of the more interesting interactions you can have with these fine folks on your own. Suffice to say, every time I thought they were out of surprises, they surprised me again. When you venture into the depths of the island, though, cannibals will be the least of your worries. There are a lot more hulking, horrible mutants in Sons of the Forest than there were in its prequel, and they're a lot more dangerous. I really came to enjoy the stronger focus on combat, as it's used very effectively to build tension rather than just to check a box or provide cheap thrills. Every fight with a powerful opponent or a large group of enemies is a heart-thumping resource management puzzle that reminded me of some of the best parts of Resident Evil or The Last of Us. Ranged weapons keep you out of danger, but ammo can be very difficult to come by. In melee, it's almost impossible to win without taking some amount of damage, which depletes your breakable armor pieces and healing items. And without batteries for your flashlight, you're as good as dead. I'd rather run out of bullets and food nine times out of 10 than lose my light source deep into a cavern run. So I found myself having to carefully consider the risks and rewards of each approach. Is losing a handful of arrows worth the loot I'll get from this cannibal camp? Is it worth the medicine I'll have to use to patch myself up if I go at this mutant with my axe to conserve ammo? The fighting itself also feels precise and responsive, so I never felt like I was robbed of my resources due to a bad hitbox or sluggish animations. Even if you played The Forest, and you know how far some of the later chapters stray from a stroll in the woods, I can fairly confidently say you still would never guess where Sons of the Forest is going to take you before the credits roll. And if you didn't play the first one, well… buckle up, I guess. The terrifying tale that begins with trying to find a billionaire and his family who went missing in the wilderness expands on the supernatural elements established in the first game – not always in ways that I enjoyed, but it certainly never got boring. The ending is both mind-blowing and, currently, pretty rough around the edges. I'm not going to show any of it here, but it's one of the few places I could really tell I was playing an Early Access game, with what seems like quite a bit of missing dialogue and some glitchy character interactions. In fact, I'd probably recommend you hold off on completing the story until it's in a more polished state, since there's so much else to do in the meantime. And that includes building your dream cannibal-proof fortress with a new, totally modular building system that lets you place individual structure elements like windows and support beams wherever you want. I spent a good five or six of my 25 hours so far just setting up a base, and I really barely scratched the surface of what is now possible. Especially if you have a full, eight-person crew in multiplayer. Which, by the way, has been running great for me so far, with no significant server issues. Sons of the Forest takes everything its predecessor did well and does it a little bit better. And considering how much I enjoyed the original, I can easily recommend this strong follow-up. Exploring a huge, beautiful, deadly island through the changing seasons is a treat on its own. The new base building mechanics could entertain me for days without ever touching the main story. And to top it all off, we have smarter and more unsettling enemy behavior paired with thoughtfully improved combat. It's already great, and it's still in Early Access. With some healthy performance optimization and shining up of an impactful but sloppy ending, it could become incredible. "
69,Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty ,8.0,"At this point, it’s probably fair to say that Team Ninja has a pretty good handle on this whole soulslike genre thing. Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty may not reach the same heights as Nioh 2 did back in 2020, but it certainly scratches that same itch of lightning-fast combat, punishing-yet-rewarding difficulty, and deep build customization options that you can craft and tailor to your own playstyle. It’s great for the same reasons that the Nioh games are, and it accomplishes that feat even while completely changing up the fundamentals of its combat system to be closer to Sekiro than Dark Souls. But by that same token, it also falls victim to the same familiar issues nagging at those other Team Ninja soulslikes, including subpar storytelling and excessively fiddly loot mechanics. But when you consider that the things Wo Long does better than just about any other game in this genre, that baggage amounts to scratches on an otherwise pristine set of armor. If you’re familiar with the Three Kingdoms era of Chinese history you may get more out of Wo Long’s story than I did (my knowledge basically begins and ends with the fact that you should not pursue Lu Bu), but I think even then it won’t be a highlight because Team Ninja continues to struggle with telling a memorable story with likable characters. This is a supernatural take on the final days of the Han Dynasty, where we take control of a nameless warrior who gets swept up in a power struggle between warring kingdoms and their pursuit of an elixir of immortality. In practically every level you team up with some sort of historically significant warrior to fight through a level, have a boss battle against an evil or corrupted historically significant warrior, and then move on to the next one.  Characters are introduced at a rapid-fire pace and leave the scene just as quickly, often without making any sort of impact on the overall story. Sometimes they return many hours later, but I’d already forgotten them because they didn’t do anything meaningful. Fortunately, the actual gameplay in between the cutscenes make up the vast majority of what we’re here to do, and it’s there that Wo Long shines brightest. Wo Long’s combat is a puzzle that needs to be figured out really quickly if you plan on getting past even the first major boss, but once you solve it, it’s incredibly satisfying to play around in. Similar to Sekiro, it’s a system that relies a lot on carefully timing deflections so you can preserve your Spirit meter while also avoiding damage, especially when enemies also start mixing in powerful, unblockable attacks that have to be parried rather than blocked. Crucially, though, you can completely negate damage from regular attacks just by holding down the block button, so long as you have enough Spirit built up to avoid having your guard broken – if that happens, you’re left helpless. You can even hold down the block button while also attempting to deflect, making it so that even if you’re too late on the deflection timing, you’ll still block the attack. It’s a good thing that Wo Long has this leniency built in because in practically every other regard, it doesn’t pull any punches. Enemies will regularly power through your attacks to deal a more powerful blow of their own, they have combos that go on for days, and they do a really good job at varying the rhythm of their attacks to try and bait you into parrying too early. It rewards a careful eye and punishes falling into a predictable rhythm. Even with all of that it isn’t nearly as hard as Nioh 2, for reasons I’ll get to later, but it still manages to find a really satisfying balance of being tough, fair, and absolutely exhilarating once you start to pick up on an enemy’s attack patterns and find yourself deflecting each hit of an incoming combo. One clever wrinkle is that your Spirit meter is also a resource that can be spent on spells, special martial arts abilities, and Spirit attacks. That’s a nice risk-reward mechanic that lets you put yourself in a potentially more vulnerable position in order to gain some sort of advantage. If you know an enemy has an elemental weakness, for instance, you can exploit that by spending Spirit to enchant your weapon with an element to stagger and quickly break them. Martial arts abilities are unique depending on the weapon you’re wielding, and there are many that offer powerful attacks that can either do big single-target damage or give you a way to deal with many enemies at once. Finally, Spirit attacks are powerful strikes that increase in damage the more Spirit you have built up, which give you another reason to hold onto your Spirit meter until you need it. If it’s not already clear, there are tons of layers to Wo Long’s combat, which greatly enhances the already excellent swordplay by laying out a ton of options and ways to vary up my strategy whenever I found myself dying repeatedly to a particular boss. If just straight-up attacking didn’t work I could focus more on defense and reduce their Spirit by deflecting their big attacks; failing that, I could double down on rushing them down and trying to break their Spirit with aggressive attacks and martial arts abilities. Or, if I could figure out what they were weak to, I could try using spells. So while Wo Long is certainly tough, I never felt like I was ever stuck against a wall with no idea of what else I could try or how to overcome a particular challenge. Where Wo Long feels very similar to the previous three Team Ninja soulslikes – in a bad way – is in its loot. More specifically, there’s an overabundance of it. I became absolutely inundated with garbage gear that I had no use for within just a few hours, and it only got worse after that. I’m just not the kind of person who really wants to spend 10 to 15 minutes in a menu trying to decipher whether a -2.6% reduction in Martial Arts Spirit is worth sacrificing a +7.2% Genuine Qi Obtention, or if I’m willing to sacrifice a few points of attack power for +24 alliance Spirit defense. Those simply aren’t interesting decisions – those are spreadsheet entries and math problems, and it’s made worse by not even being able to sort your massive list of weapons by set, or by a specific special effect you’re looking for. I’m fully aware that there are people who love these games for this level of hyper-specific build optimization, and if that is you, then you’ll find a lot to appreciate here. You can salvage junk gear to extract their special effects, then slot those special effects into weapons that you want to use, and then you can copy the appearance of any other weapon or armor so you don’t have to worry about being forced to use an ugly weapon or armor set because it has great stats. It’s fairly exhaustive in its options, but it’s also not for those of us who prefer action to menu screens.  Fortunately, I found that I didn’t have to get too far in the weeds on my first playthrough because I was more than powerful enough just by engaging with loot on a surface level. For armor, I just picked whatever gave me the highest defense number without putting me into the heavyweight category, which would limit my mobility. Then I would pick a weapon type I liked, swap it with one with a higher gear score whenever I came across one; similarly, when I found one that came with a Martial Arts ability that I liked, I just upgraded that as high as I could. No major tweaking was necessary to keep me from falling behind the power curve, leaving the complexity for those who are looking to test their mettle in the multiple iterations of New Game+ or PvP invasions. One of my favorite new ideas in Wo Long is the addition of Morale Ranks, which is basically a separate progression system that starts at zero at the beginning of every main mission and goes all the way up to 25. You gain morale simply by defeating enemies, but you’ll gain it even faster by killing them using Spirit attacks, Martial Arts abilities, or critical strikes. You will also lose some morale everytime you die, up to a certain point determined by your fortitude level, which you can increase by finding various flag poles throughout each mission. Enemies have Morale Ranks too, and those with a higher rank than you deal more damage. I love this addition because it gives every level a very natural ramp-up in difficulty, while adding extra incentive to explore and mop up more bad guys. Each level begins fairly easy: a bunch of low-morale-rank enemies make up the majority of foes, with a few high-rank monsters sprinkled in here and there to give you an occasional challenging fight. By the time you’re near the end of the level though, you’re regularly going up against rank 20 enemies and bosses that will be really tough to deal with if you haven’t been thorough in clearing out the opposition. Much like Nioh, Wo Long’s campaign is broken up into main missions and side missions, with the main missions taking you through humongous levels – from castles, to active battlefields, to jails with Dark Souls-like poison ponds on the ground floor – and the side missions typically having you revisit those settings with some sort of fun twist with regard to the objective and enemy placements. Some of my favorite side missions even have you sparring against your allies in challenging boss battles. One of the really great things that Wo Long does is that it allows you to exit out of a mission from a Battle Flag and save your progress on that main mission. This is a wonderful safety net, because frequently what can happen is you can find yourself underleveled and stuck on a main mission; here you’re allowed to back out to the level select, complete some side missions to level up or get new gear, maybe head to your secret village home base to upgrade that gear, and then return right where you left off on that main mission without feeling like you’ve lost your hard-fought progress. [Editor's Note: You actually can't do this. I tried it while I was reviewing and must have got confused by similar looking checkpoints, because it doesn't work for me now. It doesn't change my overall score or impressions, but it's a bit of a bummer]. The levels themselves won’t win any awards for how they look, but they’re very well designed from a gameplay perspective. Branching paths that often allow you to find an easier way through a particularly tough area and tons of easily missable optional detours leading to bountiful rewards keep them from being straightforward paths from point A to point B. Wo Long’s biggest problem – bigger than the loot issues and the poor storytelling – is its enemy variety. Even though the combat system is excellent and varied, there’s simply not enough different types of opponents to fill a game of this size. The ones that are here are fantastic and fun to fight, don’t get me wrong, but part of the fun of a soulslike is encountering a new threat, learning their attack patterns, and finding ways to get through the fight without taking heavy damage. In Wo Long, I felt like I figured out everything I needed to know to get through every non-boss encounter by hour five of a game that, in total, took me about 22 hours to beat. That took out a lot of the tension and fear of death that these games thrive on. Without the anxiety that something unexpected might be lying in wait around the next corner, Wo Long is still a very challenging game, but one that lacks a certain sense of adventure. It’s also worth mentioning that Wo Long also includes online co-op for up to three players, an extensive New Game+ for those who really want to min/max their characters to the extreme, and even has PvP invasions (which you can opt out of if you’d prefer to deal with relatively easy AI invaders). Unfortunately, not enough people were playing ahead of launch for me to test the competitive multiplayer features out for this review, but cooperative play is super easy to set up and play through, just like it has been in prior Team Ninja soulslikes. You can either recruit random strangers into your game from within a level when you need help, or you can start a level fresh from the beginning with a friend.  Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty’s combat plays very differently from Team Ninja’s own Nioh games – more in the mold of Sekiro than Dark Souls – and yet it manages to excel and falter in just about the same areas. When it comes to the clashing of melee weapons, Wo Long is among the best in the genre, full stop. Its action is fast and thrilling, the options for taking down its ferocious enemies are many and immensely rewarding to master, and its deflection-heavy combat is one of the most satisfying since Sekiro. All of those strengths outweigh an overbearing loot system, poor storytelling, and even a disappointing lack of variety in enemies. If not for that, Wo Long might’ve been one of Team Ninja’s greatest achievements – as it is, it’s simply a great one. "
70,Scars Above ,5.0,"As I took my first steps on Scars Above’s mysterious planet, I felt my excitement and fear rising. Almost immediately, an encounter with its grotesque alien creatures turned out to be much more complicated than I anticipated. I even died a couple of times before making any significant progress at all, giving me the impression that I was at the beginning of a harsh and nervewracking journey that was going to ask the very best of me to survive on its default difficulty level. But my fear of the unknown proved to be unjustified in this case, and the initial thrill dissipated after an hour or so when I’d unlocked the first few of a vast arsenal of weapons. After that, most of my battles became trivial, and they remained that way until the very end – even when I turned the difficulty up to hard.   Scars Above’s first section is calm. You’re introduced to your protagonist, Doctor Kate Ward, and the rest of the space scientific crew while they are investigating a strange object in Earth’s orbit. Some silly chit-chat, puzzles, and exposition later, you get to (barely) know your team and craft your first device — a tool that will become like the standard assault rifle you find in most shooters, but with shock ammo. Then, you’ll hear an unnecessarily serious speech from your captain that is supposed to be inspiring but ends up being cheesy due to its delivery and timing. The next thing you know, you wake up on an unknown planet with no idea about what happened or where everyone went.  Right after picking up an electric cutter – a basic melee weapon with the most boring attack pattern I’ve seen – I faced the first enemy. This one was easy enough, a kind of spider that usually brings some friends but doesn’t really mean any trouble — unless there are too many friends. However, when I grabbed the assault rifle I’d built and got back to the main road, it was the turn of the second type of creature: a mutated scorpion that usually hides underwater. It surprised me coming out of nowhere, and then zapped me with a poison projectile. After dealing with the beast and his partner, I realized that my life was still going down thanks to the new status. There was no way of curing this, and a few seconds later, I was respawning at the checkpoint. The same scene repeated a few times until I managed to stop catching the beast’s vomit with my face and reached the next checkpoint. What honestly felt unfair at first became the most important lesson I learned through the nine hours and six chapters of Scars Above: keep your distance from the enemies and everything they throw at you. Your electric cutter is a joke – even with the charged attack that you can unlock, it will always leave you exposed when you could just blow the aliens’ heads off with a good headshot. Of course, sometimes this will be challenging in a linear third-person shooter in which you’ll face faster monsters and smaller spaces with nowhere to run as you move through levels, but after the first couple of hours you probably won’t need any combat tips at all. You quickly craft new guns and gadgets and level up, and before long you’ll end up being so powerful that you’ll find little to no resistance. In essence, the weapons in Scars Above are the typical guns you’ll expect from any type of shooter, but with an elemental twist: there’s the aforementioned assault rifle with electric bullets, a gun that can be charged up to shoot fire ammo, a grenade launcher that freezes enemies, and a shotgun that disintegrates them with acid. As you might imagine, you can chain attacks with these weapons and produce elemental reactions that will deal bonus damage to anything that comes near you, and you can also use the environment to your advantage. Fire and acid bullets create a strong explosion, while shooting an enemy standing on water with your grenade launcher will freeze it faster. Some enemies will have a weak point in their body that will represent the element you want to shoot them with, and there are color-coded orbs around the levels that are effectively explosive barrels that deal elemental damage, too. This is a clever way of making you change weapons at all times, thinking of which is the best and most effective plan against what’s in front of you. It kept me interested for a while… until I realized that the system worked a little too well. Most of the creatures in front of me could be squashed in mere seconds by exploiting any possible elemental combination, regardless of their strength or the situation. Instead of being one part of a larger plan, shooting an electric orb at the right time completely exterminated all the threats around. If this wasn’t enough of an advantage, Kate has the ability to craft a variety of gadgets, such as a barrier that protects her for a few hits, a gravity grenade that makes everything in its area except you slow for way too many seconds, or a hologram that baits creatures, among others. All of these use the same resource (batteries), which are crafted from a resource that’s pretty much everywhere, or replenished by refilling your inventory at any checkpoint. This is way too convenient because it means you’ll hardly run out of ammo or crafting resources, especially after you’ve increased your carrying capacity. What’s worse is that the variety of gadgets that seem interesting and well thought-out when used individually felt useless when they start to overlap with each other. For instance, you can basically spam the gravity grenade and earn effectively the exact effect and/or advantages of all the other gadgets. And you can forget about dying when you find permanent healing items with several charges that can be easily refilled.  Some regular enemies that you’ll discover later will make things a bit more interesting, like one beast that can teleport behind you or a fungus monster that blinds you. They arrived a bit too late to the party, though, after I’d already become pretty bored by several hours of effortlessly killing everything around me. Not even the bosses stand out as challenges, except perhaps for the first one that you meet while you’re still creating your basic guns. That doesn’t mean that these battles are completely uninspired – they do come with mechanics that will keep you changing ammo constantly and moving around big arenas. They are fun while they last, but they also don’t present ideas that you haven’t seen already in other games (and better executed). For example, breaking the surface where an enemy is standing isn’t exactly new, and it doesn’t feel great either when you can do it more than once in a row without letting the boss move or shoot you back if you’re fast enough. The fact that some boss battles are repeated doesn’t help the case, either. What’s so frustrating about all of these issues is that Scars Above has its moments of pure joy. Facing a new creature for the first time normally involves a moment of genuine surprise, and figuring out how to handle them is engaging. Even being an unstoppable killing machine can bring satisfaction when you feel rewarded by perfectly understanding the tools at your disposal, or just by feeling your own power. And some of the later areas even took me by surprise with their scatological and repulsive (but in a good way) design, at least when compared to the dull plains and boring swamps from the earlier stages. The lack of a map directing you around is a good choice as it makes you follow your intuition and find the way, even if none of the scenarios are really big or full of secret pathways. The building blocks for a more engaging game are here, but they are surrounded by elements that lack polish, depth, and any sense of challenge.  Apart from fighting, you’ll spend time analyzing resources, clues left in the environment, and some pretty basic symbol-matching puzzles. There’s an intention of bringing a scientific perspective, considering our protagonist’s background, which is mixed in the exploration – for example, when scanning unknown objects we hear what Kate is thinking. She approaches how one creature’s digestive system works with genuine amazement, wondering how its body evolved into that group of organs and functions. The delivery of Erin Yvette, Kate’s voice actor, feels fresh and embodies a character more worried about discovering and understanding what’s around her during these calmer moments. It’s a shame that her face lacks any expression during most cutscenes, creating an unintentionally hilarious contradiction between what we are hearing and what we see.  The objective of finding the rest of the crew is one of the main plot points, but it is weak and lacks any motivation due to the fact that we don’t know anything about them. I can’t tell you a single thing about any character apart from that they are “people of science” and one of the dudes has a cute little cat toy that wears a hoodie. The intended emotional moments don’t land and some of the transitions between scenes are incredibly abrupt, killing the pacing and the tension built.  Something similar could be said about the plot. While Kate’s motivations are clear and you always know why you’re doing what you’re doing and why, it can’t be said that it’s interesting or original at all. The world of Scars Above feels flat, with some cool alien designs here and there, but not much else that made me want to explore every corner or find all the available audio logs. Far into the story, there are some cool ideas that I won’t spoil, but they are either abandoned or never pay out in any major way, and it’s a disappointment to watch them fizzle out. Scars Above shows a lot of potential in its third-person shooting, fun elemental reactions, and a good number of creatures to experiment with. The thrill of setting out to discover a new alien world is short-lived, however, due to the weapons and gadgets in your arsenal quickly growing so powerful that nothing poses a threat.  And while there are a few excellent environments to explore, everything within them – the characters, story, and universe – feel weak and underdeveloped, giving you few reasons to stop and smell the alien roses once you’ve blasted your way through. "
71,Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe ,7.0,"There are generally two types of Kirby games: the standard platformers where Kirby copies enemy abilities across easy-to-complete stages, and the more unique adventures that break wildly from that formula. Kirby’s Return to Dream Land has been solidly in the former camp since its original release on Wii in 2011, making its Deluxe rerelease on Switch recognizable in more ways than one.  Strong platforming fundamentals, creative late-game level design, and some worthwhile new content still make it worth revisiting, but it’s a more appealing package for newcomers than those who have already gone on the original adventure.   Like those aforementioned traditional Kirby platformers, the first few worlds in Kirby’s Return to Dreamland Deluxe are so remarkably unchallenging that they strip away any sense of resistance and, frankly, fun to be had. Flashy Super Abilities, which allow Kirby to do things like roll enemies up into a giant snowball or slash a massive sword across the screen, often start as almost automated sections that require very little player input. It’s important to have games that welcome newcomers, but it takes at least a couple of hours before this adventure begins to feel even remotely interesting, regardless of if you’re playing solo or with friends. However, once you reach that latter half of the campaign, Return to Dream Land begins to reveal what it’s really about. The platforming stages start relying upon Kirby’s copy abilities more heavily, like using the Water ability to skim across fiery blocks, or the Jump ability to soar to new heights by letting him leap vertically and knock enemies out of his way. And it does all of this while throwing increasingly difficult challenges in your path, whether those are (often repetitive) mini bosses fighting you on screens with pitfalls and other dangers in the way, or platforming challenges that have you escaping a wall of death with creative obstacles to scurry around. Kirby is not necessarily for you or me, but for our children, brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews. It is a whimsical, charming adventure that has clearly been designed for a younger audience first and others second. That's not a bad thing, but it does come with limitations. It's a little frustrating that Nintendo couldn't have aimed for both audiences at the same time, and I know when I was a kid I would have killed for the harder challenge, but you can only fault the game so much for that. The final stretch of Return to Dream Land, in particular, feels like the original developers were able to let loose with a relatively challenging (but never frustrating) conclusion that’s filled with creative levels and enemies alike. The finale in particular is a wild ride, standing tall with surprising twists and genuine challenge. In all, it took me about six hours to float through the main story of Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and over half of that runtime felt well worth the journey. Then there’s the multiplayer of it all. Up to three friends  can hop in and out locally at any point. They’ll play as either Meta Knight, King Dedede, or Bandana Waddle Dee, who essentially take on one distinct copy ability apiece (Sword, Hammer, and Spear, respectively) and can stack on top of each other or be carried across stages. Playing with this many players blunts some of the finer details of the level design, as it quickly becomes a chaotic game of trying to quickly clear enemies and get to the goal first – a section where you are supposed to time your movements to avoid boulders can quickly just become… run through the boulders and hope someone gets to the other side. Boss patterns can also essentially be ignored as each character pummels the enemy to oblivion. Stages in general feel designed specifically around single-player, but still work with a bigger group if that’s how you choose to play. However, like similar multiplayer platformers, there’s plenty of fun to be had just goofing around levels with a few friends. The multiplayer is probably best served as a sort of “guardian mode” where you can have a less experienced player tag along and play with you, giving Return to Dream Land yet another way to welcome newcomers.  So that’s the original Return to Dream Land, but what the heck is new to this Deluxe version? The most obvious improvement is the graphical overhaul – outside of 2022’s Kirby and the Forgotten Land, this is easily the best Kirby has ever looked, with character models, environments, cutscenes, and everything else looking remarkably improved over the 2011 Wii original. It’s also filled to the brim with charm and small details, like cowboy Kirby walking with a bit of a strut when he’s using the Whip ability. Then there are a few additions to the adventure itself. Three new abilities have been added for Kirby to wreak havoc with: Sand, Mecha, and Festival. Sand allows Kirby to form flurries into objects like sand castles and fists to smack opponents around with. The Mecha ability lets Kirby fly around the screen quickly, shoot off lasers, drop deadly mines, and fire rockets at foes above – it’s probably the most powerful copy ability in Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and my personal favorite. They’ve also brought the Festival ability over from Star Allies, which turns enemies on screen into point stars and health-recovering food items. They fit in so well that had I not known any better, I would have just assumed they were always in the original release as well.  In line with Return to Dream Land being an entry-level platformer, Deluxe also adds an easy mode called Helper Magolor. This character from another planet tosses Kirby helpful items (including health-doubling potions) and saves him when he falls into bottomless pits. While most people probably won’t need this mode turned on, it’s a great option for new or young gamers to help get their feet wet.  Speaking of Magolor, he’s the star of Deluxe’s single biggest addition – Magolor Epilogue: The Interdimensional Traveler. In this roughly two-hour mini adventure, you control an interplanetary character, who begins by being stripped of all of his powers, á la Metroid. But through collecting magic points across brand-new stages, you can purchase increasingly powerful abilities, like bombs you can gleefully rain down upon your enemies. This mode starts a bit slow, with Magolor being intentionally sluggish and relatively weak, but by the end of the journey he can become a downright powerhouse. The stages themselves are about the same quality as what’s seen in the main game, with challenge levels available to unlock if you’ve already purchased their corresponding abilities. Kirby’s signature ability to copy powers is missed in this mode, but it’s fun to get a taste of what a Kirby-style platformer that unfolds with more progression would play like. True to its name, the Magolor Epilogue can only be played after the main story is finished. Narratively this makes sense, though let’s be honest: nothing in a Kirby game’s story is particularly groundbreaking, and not letting returning players jump right into it feels a little unnecessary. Along those lines, Deluxe includes the original’s Extra Mode, which is a much more difficult version of the main story that gives Kirby less health, adds more enemies to deal with, gives bosses more challenging forms, and more. However, it also cannot be accessed until after the main mode is finished, which seems silly for a Deluxe version that plays almost identically to the original. There’s also Arena Mode, which similarly unlocks following the main story as a boss rush of sorts to further test your skills. While those certainly pad out the overall play time, I would have preferred access to them right off the bat. New to the package is Merry Magoland, a theme park filled with “sub-games” that put you against other players. In the original Wii version, Magolor’s ship (the Lor Starcutter) housed several of these minigames, but now they also exist in this colorful area, and there are two new minigames to play around with in addition to the original eight. The minigames themselves are well-made but relatively shallow, reminding me of the time I spent playing Pokemon Stadium’s minigames with my friends as a kid. They range from the star-throwing Ninja Dojo, where you try to hit moving targets either using button presses or motion-controlled throws with their Joy-Con, to the classic Samurai Kirby, a dueling minigame where each player attempts to slice as quickly as possible when prompted. They can all be played through in about half an hour and don’t add a huge amount of value to the package, but earning cosmetic masks through Magoland and playing with them in the main game can be a fun diversion. Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe takes a fun but straightforward Wii platformer, freshens it up visually, and adds a new mini adventure to pad out its otherwise relatively short campaign. Kirby’s journey across Planet Popstar starts as a slow, overly easy drudge. But once the difficulty picks up and the stages become more creative, this platformer shines through to its over-the-top conclusion – even if that conclusion comes far too soon. The Magolor Epilogue is also a welcome addition that stands on its own as another brief but worthwhile story. Return to Dream Land certainly isn’t Kirby’s best or most creative outing, but if you haven’t already played it on Wii, the Deluxe version is the ideal way to see what a traditional Kirby game is all about. "
72,Atomic Heart ,8.0,"There’s a lot to be said about unapologetically single-player games like Atomic Heart: its entire focus is on creating an intricate world for us to explore and discover for ourselves. An eye-catching blend of super-powered shooting and first-person puzzling, this is a lengthy, tough, and terrific-looking shooter that has us bathing in the blood and gears of elaborately designed enemies both biological and robotic and dispatching them with an impressive set of combat options. Granted, it’s not as clever as it thinks it is when dealing with melee combat or its typical fetch quests, and the story doesn’t quite stick its landing, but the journey from point A to point B is a sight to behold. Atomic Heart is an alternate-history shooter cut from the same cloth as BioShock and MachineGames’ Wolfenstein series. It’s a kind of retrofuturistic romp back to an imagined past perverted by ridiculously advanced technology; a world where science has made the supernatural a reality and robots are now running rife. These are far from the only shooters Atomic Heart is unafraid to crib from, either. Half-Life and the puzzle-solving of Portal are also clear inspirations, and there’s been an attempted sprinkling of Arkane’s successful brand of first-person stealth, too.  However, it’d be unfair to call Atomic Heart wholly derivative despite such recognisable building blocks. Certainly the idea of a peaceful utopia torn to pieces thanks to technology turning on its ambitious masters is nothing new, but developer Mundfish has still assembled its vision in a confident and compelling way – and the art team here well and truly understood the assignment. The most remarkable element here is the superb visual design, especially the look of these well-crafted enemies. Its range of robots is particularly strong, from its sleek and sinister moustachioed terminators that charge at us without ever averting their gaze to its pot-bellied parking meters with mouth tubes that make them look like they’re sucking at the drawstring on an invisible jacket. Its featureless ballerina bots and spindly-legged battle balls are equally memorable – the latter of which are probably best described as scaled-down, Eastern Bloc knock-offs of those things that couldn’t kill Mr. Incredible. There’s even one that looks like Baymax cosplaying as a tank. Atomic Heart’s outstanding aesthetic also extends to its large range of partially ruined labs, facilities, and transportation hubs – each filled with long, snaking globules of the liquid polymer that powers the advancements of this fantastical 1950s. That said, there is a distinct feeling of ‘look, don’t touch’ in these places (there’s definitely a lack of destructibility; balloons immune to axe swings are probably the worst offenders) but the level of detail overall is strikingly good. There are some especially tiny touches in Atomic Heart that smack of a great deal of consideration, like the way there are different reload animations for unspent magazines compared to empty ones – the latter of which are flicked away while the former are grasped by the same hand sliding a fresh one in. Watching them play out is a pleasure, which is why it was a bit annoying that my HUD was sometimes cluttered up with pick-up notifications and health bars for minibosses no longer in the area that froze onscreen until I reloaded from a recent save. I’ve also experienced some uneven quality when it comes to graphical glitches as I’ve played on Xbox Series X. The worst is a terrible strobing effect on some fast-moving robots running circuits around a large room, but fortunately it seems mostly isolated to these bot types. I’ve had no such problems with similarly nimble (and often much larger) bosses. Atomic Heart is, naturally, all tinted with the Soviet-era iconography you’d probably expect from a land tucked away deep behind the Iron Curtain in the mid-1950s, and admittedly the lens through which you may view all this Soviet symbolism is a little different today in 2023 than it was upon its announcement and first reveal back in 2018. Of course, having grown up geographically isolated and politically irrelevant in the southern hemisphere – largely detached from Cold War concerns and raised on Bond movies, Stripes, and Rocky IV – my read on such an overtly Russian backdrop is guaranteed to be markedly different to someone with roots in Eastern Europe. For its part, however, the background does largely fade away as Atomic Heart peels back the layers of its false utopia. At this stage, Facility 3826 and the countryside of rural Russia isn’t much different to the likes of BioShock’s Rapture itself. That is, a place more or less cut off from the outside world and where something has gone deeply, deeply wrong. Exploring exactly what’s gone wrong is the job of our character, special forces veteran Major Sergey Nechaev, or P-3 as he’s dubbed throughout. The foul-mouthed and amnestic P-3 is admittedly a bit of a relic of games gone by – and his default English-language voiceover doesn’t exactly do him a lot of favours. He comes off as the cookie-cutter American lead of every second shooter ever made. However, it’s the script that really does him a greater disservice. While I’ll happily admit swearing is virtually my second language, P-3 spews it with the gusto of a teenage boy testing every curse word he’s recently learned twice a sentence. It’s a little exhausting, and the presence of many modern turns of phrase don’t exactly help keep the overall experience seated in the 1950s. Of course, perhaps I’m being hypocritical in demanding consistency there, because the regularly ruthless soundtrack packed with headbangers courtesy of Doom and Wolfenstein composer Mick Gordon isn’t exactly a sonic journey back to the days of doo-wop, either – and yet the music is pitch perfect as far as I’m concerned. At any rate, there is a Russian-language/English subtitle option for purists, but I would’ve simply preferred an English script that was more tempered for the setting and era. There are well over 20-odd hours of play here in the main story thread alone, with many more available in the side objectives – some of which border on crucial if you actually want the best weapons. Some of that is padding but it’s a good length overall, and nicely inside that not-too-short, not-too-long Goldilocks zone for a great solo shooter. There are also two endings you can get based on just one choice you make in the finale, although after seeing both I found the first anticlimactic and don’t think the second was worth the reload. However, while P-3 is disappointingly threadbare as a character, he’s nonetheless very capable and entertaining to play as – largely thanks to his partner, Charles, who is a talking glove. Okay, that’s a bit reductive – rather, Charles is basically an intelligent system embedded in P-3 who is capable of granting him seemingly supernatural abilities, manifested by a set of small, squid-like tentacles that extend from a glove on P-3’s left hand. This not only includes activating an X-ray-style view of your surroundings and tossing certain small objects à la Half-Life 2’s iconic gravity gun, but also the ability to fire bolts of electricity or ice, levitate enemies into the air to shoot or slam into the ground, or even summon a temporary shield. Akin to BioShock’s Plasmids, these abilities add an important layer of more interesting combat on top of Atomic Heart’s otherwise fairly typical blasting and slightly clumsy melee combat. There’s a great sense of weight when beaning a bot in the brainpan with an axe – and the gouges that appear across their bodies in real-time is a great touch – but I found the weapon swinging too slow and frustrating when swarmed by too many enemies simultaneously. The juggling act of defeating dense swarms of robots as well as the blender-sized hovering repair bots that continually swoop in to magically resurrect them gets a bit wearisome at times, especially above ground. Atomic Heart’s linear, underground sequences are linked by a decent-sized slab of open world where we’re free to explore and fight wherever we wish, and this zone is initially a nice antidote to the more corralled corridor segments that progress the story or reward us with useful upgrades. However, with their long line-of-sight and overwhelming numbers, I often found myself running or driving away from fights rather than diving in or trying to get the upper hand via stealth before attacking – because they’re not that much fun to fight over and over. There is a way to fry all enemies within a zone for a while if you’re patient, and the robot hordes do become a little less intimidating as P-3 and his arsenal grow stronger throughout the story, but that’s a process that takes some time. Unlocking and upgrading these abilities requires a steady supply of resources, which the levels and defeated enemies are generally chock full of, even if collecting them can become a bit of a chore. Atomic Heart is smart to keep this process fast by allowing us to extend out a hand and suck up reams of resources like an industrial shop vac, but it still becomes a little tedious having to ransack the same sets of desks and cabinets arranged slightly differently in a hundred-or-so different rooms. Tedious, too, is Atomic Heart’s overly ambitious attempt to weasel its way out of accountability for leaning on some extremely hackneyed fetch quests. Having the main character cynically gripe and complain about collecting four canisters for a bafflingly unintuitive door-locking mechanism that would never get past any sensible architectural committee isn’t a free pass to proceed with it. The main character being annoyed for the same reason I am isn’t cute, it’s a tone deaf non-apology for weak game design. It’s a shame that some better context wasn’t baked around these occasional fetch quests because Atomic Heart’s underground chambers feel like a ripe opportunity and are largely great otherwise: eerie, deadly, and mostly devoid of life – unless you count the mutant freaks with skulls shattered into fanged, floral arrangements or the dead bodies that communicate via the confused ramblings of their fading brain implants. It does rely too heavily on repeating the same handful of door lock minigames that serve no real purpose other than to arbitrarily slow your progression from room to room, but I do like the bespoke platforming puzzle chambers and one-off brainteasers – especially the clever visual puzzle you’ll encounter late during your trip to an ornate theatre full of robotic performers. Atomic Heart is a deeply ambitious, highly imaginative, and consistently impressive atompunk-inspired attempt at picking up where the likes of BioShock left off – something it’s done with a lot of success. It certainly makes missteps, chiefly with an irritating leading man and a self-indulgent habit of using the same tired tropes it tries to make fun of, but this stern, superpowered, and stringently solo shooter has worked its way under my skin despite these flaws. Atomic Heart didn’t always blow me away, but it definitely has the ticker to punch well above its weight. "
73,Metroid Prime Remastered ,10.0,"In the two decades since the original release of Metroid Prime I’ve had no problem giving it my highest recommendation, along with one nagging reservation: The controls take some getting used to. Thanks to the outstanding updates in Metroid Prime Remastered, I can finally drop that caveat: Metroid Prime Remastered is one of the best first-person shooters ever made, full stop. This updated version goes above and beyond the typical coat-of-paint remaster by adding modern controls along with fabulously improved models and textures – it’s a perfect example of how to both honor a lauded classic and bring it up to code. Replaying it feels almost entirely new, evoking that same fresh feeling as the Dead Space remake or Resident Evil 2 and 3 despite not actually being such a drastic remake itself – and it’s a far cry from the disappointing treatment that the Super Mario 3D All-Stars collection on Switch received.   What makes Metroid Prime obviously different from other legendary FPS campaigns like Halo, Half-Life, Titanfall 2, and Wolfenstein is its solitary nature. There’s not a single conversation to be had, no radio or AI assistant voices chattering in your ear, and, just for the record, no multiplayer. This is a game about a lone hunter – Samus Aran – on a hostile world, and Prime revels in that setup. Like other great Metroid games (e.g. Super Metroid, Metroid: Zero Mission, and the most recent Metroid Dread), Metroid Prime’s spareness in its storytelling makes for a uniquely moody magnificence. It’s more horror than space opera, no doubt owing to Metroid’s key influence, Ridley Scott’s 1979 masterpiece movie, Alien. The planet, Tallon IV, has as much or more development than any character, told in its geology, technology, flora, fauna, and “other” –  and yes, in much of the encyclopedic lore you acquire via a HUD scanning function. In this way the story is told through experience with your environment alone, and despite the narrative methods not getting any sort of update, it still feels revolutionary and modern compared to all the very talky games we play today. (It must be noted that attempts at adding a bunch of characters hasn’t been great for the Metroid series, specifically, with Metroid: Other M and Metroid Prime: Hunters being especially goofy in their world-building.) There are so many things to laud in Metroid Prime, but its biggest accomplishment is Tallon IV itself. Each room has a purpose and a name, with details that make no two places quite alike. A flowing fountain babbles down the side of a sunny sanctuary hall; a furnace chamber pumps heat through conveniently morph-ball sized vents to other areas; a lab deep underground holds experiments in tubes that act as jump-scare time bombs. It’s all logically laid out to reflect the story and setting, but the world mirrors your progress in a brilliant way: Rooms that once took toil and grit to get through can soon be zipped through with the help of a newly obtained skill or weapon. Arm CanonOriginally the controls for Metroid Prime on GameCube were so clumsy and awkward that its fans had to argue it was not an FPS at all, but something else, such as a first-person puzzle game. You had to lock onto a target and shoot, instead of allowing full, dual-joystick movement, and trying to go from any other shooter to this was like having to learn to walk again. Since then we’ve seen options to use the Wii-like motion controls established in the Metroid Prime Trilogy collection, or a variant of the original controls on the GameCube controller, but none made it something that was easy for most people to pick up and play. The new dual analog stick controls are indistinguishable from modern shooters, though, and actually make some battles a bit easier. You can strafe, jump, dodge, and control your view with so much more dexterity. The way you experience the ruins, caves, and laboratories of Tallon IV is through a visor, set in a helmet in your suit, which is a perfect setup for immersion in first-person. The visor’s HUD gives you all of your basic info, like many games have come to do since, but it also acts like a real, hi-tech glass dome: it steams up when blasted with flame, muffles Samus’s cries, and in flashes of bright light it’ll even reflect her own surprised eyes for an instant. These are all brilliant little tricks that cause the barrier between you and the world on your TV or Switch screen to melt away, allowing you to meld dreamily into it – which is why it is all the more jarring (in a good way!) when you pop out into the third-person Morph Ball view. You can enter your Morph Ball mode at any time, and when you do, the camera flies outward so you can watch as Samus collapses into a knee-high ball and performs a number of rolling, Tony Hawk-like maneuvers to solve puzzles, get through cramped areas, or just zoom really fast while backtracking. Many rooms have a feature that requires you to switch forms, ranging from a simple hidden passageway to a maze-like physics-based contraption you must navigate with precision rolling; it challenges your dexterity in an entirely different way than the first-person shooting or platforming. You’ll get occasional looks at Samus in the third person when she’s not in ball form, such as in the rare (high frame rate, completely and gorgeously remodeled) cutscenes, but sometimes you also get a glimpse of her as the camera rushes back into her helmet, a rare flash that reveals the complexity of building a game around what’s basically a first-person shooter / pinball machine mash-up. Aside from the third-person Morph Ball, Metroid Prime Remastered has you doing a lot of things a side-scrolling Metroid would: jumping across precarious platforms, swinging from a grappling hook, and ascending huge, vertical spaces, littered with hostile critters. This was all quite novel in 2002 but feels standard today: Clever implementation of a double-jump gives you an extra period of mid-air adjustment to solve so many precision-jumping and grappling issues, and Prime is forgiving with what’s under your feet so there isn’t a lot of replaying areas due to frustrating falls. You can definitely miss a platform, but it’s nothing that wouldn’t happen in Super Mario Bros. as well. What’s interesting is how much better I am at platforming in first-person after 20 years of Halo games, because modern shooters just all do this now and it's in my FPS muscle memory. The Metroid Prime Remaster still sticks the landings – and the jumps. And while I mostly played on a Pro Controller, the fact that Metroid Prime is portable is still mind-blowing, if less novel six years into the Switch’s life. Of course, all shooters that use triggers are less comfortable on the Switch’s Joy-Con-attached setup, and Prime does have one odd quirk in its default controls that make you hit both the trigger to charge a shot and the shoulder button to fire it. That’s not ideal on either controller setup, but it’s especially cumbersome on the Joy-Cons because those buttons are so small and close together. Wii-style pointer controls using a detached pair of Joy-Cons are included as well, emulating the controls used in the Metroid Prime Trilogy on Wii. They work just as they should, which is a nice addition, but the new dual analog controls are the way to play Prime Remastered. In Its Prime Aside from the controls, the big addition to Metroid Prime Remastered is a complete overhaul of the graphics, which never lose sight of the art style that made the original so pretty. Water ripples, steam occludes, insects light the way and cast shadows like lanterns, metal reflects and shines (except for the mirrors; you can no longer see yourself in those for some reason); it all looks exquisite, as beautiful as any modern Switch game. Of all the beautiful moments exploring Tallon IV, nothing is ever recycled. There are hundreds of rooms, hallways, pools, and arenas, and none of them are alike – as evidenced by the intricate 3D map. Pan out from the map and you can see the insane geometry of Tallon IV. One of my favorite things to do in Prime is to pause, and, while the background music throbs, spin the map and look for tiny outlets that shouldn’t be there, a depression that could hint at a new path, or a door of a color I can’t access yet – those virtually always yield a secret when I investigate. I spend a good amount of playtime planning my routes on that map, too; there’s no fast travel in Metroid Prime, so if you want to be efficient, you need to think carefully about how you’re going to get from point A to point B. This makes collectible runs a blast, because knowing that once you get a new pickup that allows you to blast, roll, or grapple in a different way, you can plan a loop to revisit promising-looking areas with new gear to collect power ups. Of course there are elevators and other shortcuts to unlock, but the real power you amass in Metroid Prime is the ability to move freely over its pitfalls. One thing that surprised me was that, 20 years on, first-person shooters are still largely built around flat planes, straight corridors, and ballooning arenas. But Metroid Prime does something different: The world is molded and organic, with twisted tree roots, curvy mushrooms, and jagged ruins that interrupt deep pools; and that’s fun because a secret could be hidden anywhere. Whether you are scanning the room with your visor for clues, trying different ammo types on odd-looking textures, or attempting to roll up an apparent slope perfectly crafted for Morph Ball tricks, you have to actually feel your way around Prime. It’s the most tactile game I’ve ever played outside of VR. Metroid Prime Remastered sounds amazing as well. Some of old-school Metroid’s most memorable tunes are redone in the fun cyberpunk electronica of Prime, and the soundtrack’s original songs have stood the test of time themselves. What’s really cool about the remaster is the mix of sound effects you get on modern televisions or over headphones: a crucial aspect of secret hunting is sound, a sort of proximity-based hum you would do well to learn to recognize if you want to 100% Prime. It’s a blast slaughtering a room of screeching enemies just so you can silence them and listen closer to try and sort out where the heck that Missile Tank is hiding. And by the way, to get everything in Metroid Prime Remastered it took me about 13 hours. But I know what I’m doing (I contributed to the strategy guide, and recommend using it for a 100% run!), and the Hard Mode you can unlock by beating it on Normal is worth a second go for a serious challenge. Remastered Blaster No matter how many new powers and weapons you unlock, you are never invincible in Metroid Prime – and it’s quite difficult on normal settings, as games go today. If you’re new to it, you might spot certain modern design similarities in the hunt to find your next save spot. Do you risk delving further into the depths of a region, or do you turn back and save the progress you’ve made? After an hour of plundering, your life bar low, and no new save spot in sight, things can get quite tense. This also makes the power ups – mainly life and ammo capacity expansions (but also some optional weapon upgrades I highly recommend) – incredibly meaningful because they increase your ability to explore farther and farther from safety. Unlike so many modern games’ collectible sets, spending time hunting things down really matters in Prime. By the back portion of the campaign you will need to use your full arsenal (and tons of ammo) to reach the end, but what cooler way to grind than to go hunt for secrets with your new gear? It’s an extremely rewarding loop. But you won’t just need to bulk up for further exploration. Boss fights in Metroid Prime come with multiple forms and large (often invisible) life bars, making them tougher than they appear at first glance. It’s one thing to figure out a boss’s patterns – which attacks you can jump, dodge, or cancel with a counter attack – but another to figure out if you are even doing damage. One boss throws enemies at you while it actually disappears to go recharge its life. You can get stuck in an endless battle if you don’t figure out the secret to interrupting this routine. This is a good example of how combat is made varied and interesting in Metroid Prime: often you will need to figure out which combination of visor (they can see at different wavelengths, exposing weaknesses), beam (you have fire, ice, and some others), and concussive ammo, works on each enemy. Do you freeze and shatter a titular metroid or fry it alive? And then… they adapt to your weapons and you can’t do either. Aside from a few main bosses that trap you, you usually flee tough fights, and sometimes sprinting through infested rooms is the only option.  There are other changes, big and little, that we’ve documented on this Switch Version Differences page, but some of the best besides the controls and graphics are the fast load times (no more waiting for doors to open), and the ability to toggle on the (English) narration that was present in the Japanese and European versions of the original. It’s only a few extra callouts, not enough to ruin the essential feeling of exploring in total solitude, but it’s a nice touch. One other significant change is that the credits for the original Metroid Prime are missing from the Remastered ending, so if you want to see who was responsible for much of the magic, here are the full Metroid Prime credits.  Metroid Prime has been one of my favorite games for decades, but I’m still shocked that its bones are so strong. 21 years later, in 2023, Metroid Prime Remastered had to do so little beyond modernizing the controls and updating the graphics to become one of the best games you can buy once again. This ultimate solo mission is a respite from the noise of hint-giving companions and lengthy cinematic cutscenes that make up much of today’s single-player games. Those things have their place, but Metroid Prime Remastered shows that you can tell a story and create a grand adventure by building an amazing world and creating unique and fun tools to explore it with. I strongly encourage you to delve into Metroid Prime Remastered, and get lost. "
74,Octopath Traveler 2 ,7.0,"When I reviewed the original Octopath Traveler almost five years ago, I absolutely loved it. I was completely smitten with its art style, its spiritual and artistic connections to the 16-bit JRPGs I grew up with, and its amazing battle system. Playing Octopath Traveler 2, I was excited to see everything I loved about the original return. What’s surprising, however, is how little it's advanced in the last half-decade. In fact, outside of the specific stories being told, Octopath Traveler 2 is almost indistinguishable from its predecessor. That means it’s just as great in many ways, but that lack of novelty also makes it a bit less magical the second time around. Because Octopath Traveler 2 is so similar to its excellent predecessor, there’s no reason not to go back and play the original first. But the stories aren’t directly connected either, so if you are considering starting the journey here, you should know that once again the name ”Octopath” refers to the eight playable characters and the paths they follow through the world. You can choose to start with any of them, and after playing through the first hour-long chapter of their story you're stuck with that character for the rest of the campaign – meaning you can't remove them from your party. You're then free to wander the beautiful tilt-shift world, but areas are more or less locked out by their difficulty level. For example, if you enter an area with a ""Danger Level 16"" and you're at level five, you're going to be murdered pretty much instantly upon your first encounter. You might think to yourself ""Ah, but I am a seasoned JRPG veteran, I know a thing or two about how to approach high-level zones,"" but I'm here to tell you you're wrong. If the area says it's 16, you best have a party of characters at or above level 16.  Octopath Traveler is a JRPG dream come true. Both its battle system and aesthetic pay loving tribute to the Super NES era while moving the formula forward in exciting and novel ways. This isn’t merely a modern retread of past classics, but a phenomenal homage with genuinely fresh ideas in a fantastically charming wrapper of old-school meets new. While the eight different character stories could’ve used a little more connection between them, I’m looking forward to going back to complete them all, explore the many side areas, battle optional bosses, and unlock the final job classes. Once you do begin wandering in your level-appropriate areas, you’ll come across new towns with new characters. Upon meeting a new character you're given the option to play through their first chapter or just add them to your party. I liked that it gives you the choice, since I prefer powering my way through games and asking questions later, but what I didn't like was discovering fairly late in the campaign how important it is to actually play through each chapter yourself. You're just going to have to trust me to avoid spoilers, but it’s too bad it ends up feeling like a deceptive choice. This time around, each character has a pair of special abilities: one for the day and one for the night. Day or night can be toggled at will, so it’s more like switching between modes than something you have to wait around for. It's pretty cool, because there are some characters you need to interact with who only show up at night, so you can just swap between the different versions of the world rather than drudge across town and visit an inn or whatever. Throné, the thief I chose as my starting character, pickpockets people during the day and ""ambushes"" them by night, putting them to sleep. The ambush skill is useful when, say, a doorway is blocked by an NPC, wgile pickpocket is a good way to load up on items without having to visit the shops. It's win-win! Other characters’ abilities include recruiting townspeople to summon during battles, fighting townspeople to learn special combat moves, and capturing monsters to call in during encounters, to name a few. Some of them are basically reskins of other characters' abilities – recruiting followers is the most common of the skills, for example, but it comes in handy when you have two or three extra sets of hands to summon in a battle. I like the system because it lets you pick and choose companions for future fights, but you can also just steal their stuff, too, and they don't even mind! The day/night cycle is most important in towns, but it also makes a difference in the overworld. Enemies are more difficult at night, which means more experience, so it can be a good idea to change to the night during your travels if you’re feeling confident. Travel between towns is done via connecting paths rather than an open overworld. It's more like traveling around in a Mana game or Chrono Trigger, versus a Final Fantasy or Dragon Warrior game. That's not a bad thing though, and I like that a game called ""Octopath Traveler"" makes you literally travel via paths from location to location. Beyond the towns and cities, there are temples to visit, which bless a character with a new ""EX"" ability. I recommend tracking down all these temples, because those abilities are extremely handy to have and make the late-game a little less arduous. Each character has their own multi-chapter story to progress through, but I did like how they’re all quite different in tone and scope. For example, Hikari's tale starts off with what's definitely the most epic and open of them all and most typical of what you’d expect in a massive 80-hour JRPG like this, while Partitio's is much more humble – and yet this simple merchant’s story surprised me and ended up being my favorite out of them all. I especially enjoyed the way Cassti's played out, with some entertaining fourth-wall-breaking moments. In fact, I found all of the individual stories' conclusions satisfying, but the paths leading up to them didn't always resonate with me, particularly the ones with less at stake. Again, it makes sense once you've completed them, but it’s harder to savor a story about a clumsy dancer trying to become famous in the moment when someone else is fighting to take back the stolen throne of their country. All the stories are at least an improvement over the original, although not so much that HBO is going to be optioning any of them for a gritty drama any time soon. It’s fortunate that I’m still a big fan of the excellent turn-based battle system from the first game, because it returns almost unchanged here. Each enemy has one or more ""weak points"" to uncover by hitting them with the right weapon or elemental attack. (It's not a glowing orb on the back of their head like you might be thinking for weak points in games, it's a point of weakness.) Once you uncover the weak point of an enemy type, it's displayed for every subsequent encounter. I loved the system in the first game, and I'm not surprised to see it return. However, it can get frustrating in some of the bigger boss battles, because you end up wasting so many attacks just trying to uncover weaknesses. Still, I really enjoy the extra dimenson it brings to fights as I try to line up my weak point attacks in a way that stuns a target so my most powerful regular attacks can do more damage, while also aiming to prevent the strongest enemies from getting a chance to attack me back. However, lifetime of playing turn-based JRPGs means I’ve grown accustomed to a certain predictability with the nature of a weak point, and enemy weaknesses here often feel entirely random. If you encounter an enemy that's clearly made of ice, the vocabulary of JRPGs (and, you know, physics) would suggest that creature would be weak to fire… but in Octopath Traveler 2 that's rarely the case at all. That frozen elemental is actually weak to light magic! Or ice for some reason! If there's a connection between enemy types and weaknesses it's not immediately clear, which means the first round of each battle with a newly discovered enemy is an exercise in guesswork (outside of the few character abilities that will provide a little starting intel). You're pretty safe shooting flying enemies with arrows to expose their weakness, but not always. It seems very arbitrary. On Nintendo Switch, I found Octopath Traveler 2 to be something of a downgrade from the original. The amazing 2D/3D art style returns, and areas seem like they're filled with even more 16-bit papercraft eye-candy, but some of the lighting effects I loved from the first – particularly the sparkles on the snowfields – are gone. I also encountered a problem where certain boss battles would freeze up entirely for long enough that I would start to panic, as well as certain sections of cutscenes hitching up and requiring me to hold 'B' to skip. Quitting out entirely and loading fixed these issues, but it was a huge bummer and led to some battles taking longer – even much longer – than they should have if it was running smoothly. I’m glad I didn’t have to uncover weaknesses every time because there is a fair amount of grinding involved in Octopath Traveler 2, which I don't necesarilly mind. Obviously opinions differ on this subject, but I find grinding in RPGs almost meditative, as long as putting in a little extra effort before a boss battle pays off in the end. You won't progress your party if you don't spend some time on that grind, as the leveling required to get to the next part of the story isn't achieved simply by following the path laid out. You're going to have to do some back and forth and running in circles and leveling up before you can move on. That being said, if you enter into a ""Danger Level 14"" area and reach the boss with a party at or near level 14, you should be able to defeat it, so I always had a clear idea of how far off I was. You can brute-force your way through some of the earlier bosses, just like in any JRPG, but the abilities systems, weakness exploits, and battle-point bonuses forced me to get pretty strategic with my thinking in order to do so. After losing a boss battle more than once, I would immediately take a look at my party: What strengths do they have? What complimentary skills can I employ to improve their abilities? Am I equipping the right secondary jobs and weapons? In other words, you cannot live by the grind alone. Once I struck the right balance of all the different elements, I was able to retry and bring down even the trickiest bosses, and it was a lot more rewarding because of it. That being said, the final boss sucks so much. Without spoiling anything, I will say that I went into the final boss fight confident in my team's abilities and strengths, only to be defeated time and time again. Of all the RPG boss battles I've played over the years, Octopath Traveler 2 gave me the most trouble. I was one attempt away from making a spreadsheet – and no, that is not a joke. The only reason I finally beat the boss wasn't because I was over-leveled (which I was… by a lot), but because I took a deep breath and literally wrote out battle notes before my final attempt. I struck a balance of skills, weapons, character matches, and item use and gave more thought and organization to that final encounter than I think I've ever done in a game, ever. No joke, I spent more than 10 hours trying, and failing, to defeat the final boss. It was the most astonishingly brutal JRPG boss I can remember fighting, and when I finally got that victory, it was a joy like no other. It sounds crazy, but the way I had to rethink and plan out my entire approach to that final battle actually improved my opinion of this sequel. Once again, I am smitten by Octopath Traveler and its style – but five years after the original, it doesn't hit quite as hard. So little has changed about its battles, and this sequel sticks a little too closely to the original systems without expanding on them too much. Especially now that the 2D/3D art style is an established look, the still lovely visuals just don’t stand out as much anymore. That said, the combat system is still quite fun, and figuring out the best course of action to exploit weak points, knock an enemy unconscious, and then unload on them with as much power as you can remains satisfying. I did also find myself more invested in the stories this time around, and the way it comes together in the end is more interesting and cohesive than the first. If you liked Octopath Traveler (or even any of the Bravely Default games) Octopath Traveler 2 is another good ol' fashioned 80-hour JRPG - it just feels like one I’ve played before. "
75,Like a Dragon: Ishin! ,7.0,"I had been under the impression that bringing a gun to a knife fight was strictly the Chicago way, but apparently it was the way of the samurai too – at least if the mix of gunslinging and sword-swinging in Like a Dragon: Ishin! is any indication. This 2023 remake of a 2014 Yakuza series spin-off that was previously only available to Japanese audiences transposes the tried and tested street fighting formula from modern Tokyo onto the final days of Japan’s Edo period, replacing the weaponised traffic cones and potted plants with katanas and primitive pistols. It suffers somewhat as far as its substories and side activities go, with both not quite up to the standard set by subsequent releases, but a card-augmented combat system keeps the fighting fresh and the crime story plot is packed with more delicious pulp than a Nashi pear. Like a Dragon: Ishin! might not be on the cutting edge of the katana blade, but it rarely strays onto the dull side either. It appears you can take the Yakuza story out of the streets of modern Tokyo, but you can't take the modern gangsters out of the Yakuza story. The events of Like a Dragon: Ishin! may take place in 1860s Kyoto and feature characters loosely based on real historical figures, but most of the roles in its main cast are filled with a host of recognisable faces from other Yakuza games. Thus its protagonist Sakamoto Ryoma, a disgraced ronin out to avenge the murder of his adoptive father, is clearly just series stalwart, Kazuma Kiryu, right down to his permanent scowl and unwavering sense of justice. I must admit that even as a longtime fan it initially got a little confusing when Kazuma Kiryu playing Sakamoto Ryoma went undercover as Saito Hajime in order to infiltrate the Shinsengumi police force. Still, my fondness for him helped me buy into his plight almost immediately, and although Ishin’s story beats are similar to those featured in several other Yakuza games, setting its figurative (and literal) backstabbing against the backdrop of a potential Japanese civil war made the stakes feel higher than those surrounding the typical turf battles.  Unlike recent releases from developer Ryu Ga Gotoku that feature English voice casts like Yakuza: Like a Dragon and Lost Judgment, Ishin can only be played with the original Japanese audio with subtitles. That may be considered a negative to some, but personally I like experiencing these stories with dialogue delivered in the characters’ native tongue, and it seems even more appropriate in this case given that Ishin takes place at a time when Japan was still largely sheltered from Western influences. That said, even with the translated subtitles turned on, there are a great deal of period-specific references to regions, religions, and regiments that I found to be almost impenetrable early on. Constantly pausing dialogue in Ishin’s opening hours in order to consult the in-game glossary (along with Google) to help fill in the gaps did upset the rhythm of the storytelling somewhat, but over the course of my 30-hour playtime I learned to distinguish a goshi from a joshi, and ultimately came away feeling more enlightened about a crucial period in Japanese history that I previously knew very little about. I was less inspired by the environment itself, however. 19th century Kyoto’s woodland surroundings certainly make for a nice change of scenery from the bustling urban jungle of present day Tokyo, and much like Kamurocho it's arguably best experienced at night, trading neon-soaked streets littered with drunken locals for lantern-lit lanes littered with… well, also plenty of drunken locals. (It turns out sake has been making Japanese people feel jolly for well over a thousand years.) However, while Ishin’s small slice of Japan’s original capital city is not without its standout sections, such as the bustling marketplace lining the canals in the Fushimi district, there are also far too many bland back streets that make navigating your way around a bit less appealing. I found myself far more reliant on the trip-skipping palanquin service in Ishin than I ever made use of the taxi services in other Yakuza adventures. As with any other Yakuza game, the rustic riverside streets aren’t just meant for sightseeing, but also fight-spreeing, and Like a Dragon: Ishin! introduces a blend of blades and bullets that makes its combat feel refreshingly distinct from other entries in the series for the most part. Ryoma has four different fighting stances that you can switch between on the fly, allowing you to go from the smash and bash of the barehanded Brawler technique to the slash and dash of the Swordsman style with a tap of the D-pad. They vary in usefulness, though, and I found the pistol-only Gunman style to be particularly inconsistent in its implementation. It either made life too easy by allowing me to fill hallways of sword-swinging enemies with unlimited rounds of hot lead before they could get close enough to strike back, or its fickle auto-targeting would frustratingly force me to shoot at foes in the distance rather than the warrior in front of me threatening to clean out my ears with a sharpened spear.  I found the Wild Dancer style proved to be by far the most fun and reliable combat stance in Like a Dragon: Ishin!, and thus its skill tree is the one I invested in most heavily. Wild Dancer finds Ryoma at his most fleet-footed, composed of a combination of fast sword-slashes and a spinning blast of gunfire that’s excellent for crowd control, along with a twirling evade move that can be chained together to pinball him out of harm’s way and into a position of power. The fact that its faster attacks came at the cost of it dealing slightly less damage overall made it less effective against the more brutish bosses, but at that point I’d just smoothly switch to the deliberate and powerful Swordsman technique and indulge in a more steadily-paced samurai showdown. While I may have relied on only two of the four fighting stances available to me for the vast majority of the adventure, they still provided enough variety to entertain. That’s particularly when used in tandem with Ishin’s unique Trooper card system, which effectively allows for custom support loadouts for each of Ryoma’s fighting styles. I enjoyed experimenting with different decks of cards, from the more passive Troopers that provide boosts to your attack power and health, to far more outlandish assault cards like a chicken that lays egg-shaped proximity mines and even your own personal attack bear. There are hundreds of these Trooper cards to uncover in Ishin and each card can be leveled up in combat, fused with other cards, or even promoted to unlock more powerful abilities, bringing a welcome amount of depth and strategy – and a splash of welcome silliness – to what initially seems like a fairly straightforward action game on the surface. Ishin gives Ryoma plenty of opportunities to keep his sword sheathed, and one of the more substantial side activities sees him become the caretaker to a small farm in order to support a  local orphan named Haruka. It’s a pretty involved process – you must carefully arrange your vegetable crops to maximise your return on each harvest, invest in additions such as chicken coops and scarecrows to further increase the farm’s output, and then meet meal delivery requests by completing simple Cooking Mama-style mini-games in order to turn a profit. I’ll be honest, farming simulation is really not for me, and if I ever make a stop in Stardew Valley it will be merely to ask for directions to the nearest highway so I can hightail it out of there. Still, this farm is an entirely optional undertaking and it certainly provides a more chilled out change of pace to take a sharp blade to radishes instead of ronins, if that’s the sort of thing you’re after. Considering I enter each Yakuza adventure with a cocked fist rather than a green thumb, I was far more invested in the 40 different dungeon crawling missions offered at the Shinsengumi barracks. These provide an opportunity for farming of a decidedly more violent variety, running blade-first through bandit hideouts in order to scavenge precious materials required to forge more powerful weapons at the blacksmith, as well as level up your trooper cards to be fighting fit ahead of the next story mission. The reused cave backdrop does start to feel somewhat samey, but the layouts, door switches, and trap and enemy placements are shuffled up consistently enough to make each gauntlet run feel distinct. Even after completing Ishin’s main story, I’ve returned to the barracks to mop up the remaining Shinsengumi dispatches that I missed on my way through because I find them so satisfying to complete. In comparing this 2023 release of Like a Dragon: Ishin! with the 2014 Japanese PlayStation 4 original, it’s clear that lighting and textures have been improved to bring it more in line with the more recent series entries on the surface, but it still shows its age somewhat with some stiff character animations and  loading screens that occasionally disrupt cutscenes and a lot of the transitions from exteriors to interiors. On the plus side, the Trooper card system was previously limited to the Shinsengumi side missions but can now be used throughout the adventure, which strikes me as a big benefit as far as keeping combat consistently fun. Even so, the bones of this 2023 version of Like a Dragon: Ishin! appear to be the same as the original, making it feel closer to a remaster than a substantial remake. Elsewhere a lot of the series’ side activity staples are present and accounted for, with various types of gambling including poker and chicken racing, karaoke, and dance mini-games just a few of the distractions to indulge in. There are some fun ye olde Yakuza spins on modern mini-games to be found, too – instead of smacking baseballs in a batting cage you get to slice cannon balls in half with a well-timed swing of your sword, for example – but the bulk of these archaic amusements just can’t compete with the more dazzling diversions to be found in the contemporary settings of other Yakuza and Judgment games. Trading Club Sega arcades and go kart races for fishing and woodchopping feels a bit like forgoing a fun night on the town for a sleepy weekend away at your grandparents’ place – it’s still enjoyable and not without its charms, but it doesn’t exactly get your heartrate up. The substories that can be stumbled upon are similarly lacking in any real surprises. In most Yakuza games you can’t make your way from A to B without taking an unexpected detour into WTF territory, but Ishin’s substories are mostly more conservative by comparison. There are some rare offbeat exceptions, and I was certainly amused when an errand to buy perfume for a young lady suddenly swerved into a frenetic chase sequence with a lustful salesman hot on my tail like a horny Pepé Le Pew, but for the most part these interactions with locals are pretty subdued compared to the more outrageous scenarios experienced elsewhere in the series. That said, although helping an old lady to find her way home is pretty uneventful (though certainly noble), it’s still worth doing since Ishin’s Virtue system rewards you for almost every interaction you have – whether it’s a substory, shopping at a store, or feeding a stray dog. The Virtue points you earn can be spent on everything from upgrading Ryoma’s sprinting stamina to expanding Haruka’s farm, so rarely does any task in Ishin go entirely unrewarded, no matter how innocuous it may seem. While its half-baked gunplay should probably have remained holstered, Like a Dragon: Ishin!’s stylish sword fighting and over-the-top Trooper card attacks successfully pair the Yakuza series’ brand of hysterical action with the historical fiction of its 19th century Japan setting. Unfortunately, its step back in time also presents a slight step down in quality for its substories and side activities, which have each been eclipsed in entertainment value by the other Yakuza and Judgment games in the years since Ishin’s original Japanese release, and the blander areas of its low-tech environment can’t quite compete with the flashy charms of Kamurocho when it comes to exploration. Even so, its high stakes story had me hooked throughout, and it was fascinating to get an insight into a period of Japanese history I knew very little about previously, albeit through a heavily fictionalized lens. No matter which way you slice it, Like a Dragon: Ishin! is an enjoyable and interesting spin-off from the Yakuza series, but not an essential one. "
76,Horizon Call of the Mountain ,7.0,"Horizon Call of the Mountain knows what its job is: to ride the popularity of Horizon Forbidden West and spearhead Sony’s new foray into virtual reality gaming, the PlayStation VR 2. It really goes for it by placing less of a focus on the expansive story of Forbidden West and much more on spectacle, often wowing with the sights it places in front of you. On that level it’s a remarkable technical showcase that lets you have a good deal of excitement when taking the handbrake off and handing you control of its exhilarating combat. It’s therefore a slight shame that it often operates at a much more relaxed pace, which does allow you to frequently take in the beauty of its world, but prevents itself from thrilling consistently from start to finish. When it does all click, though, and those heights are hit, a very fun time is there to be had. Similarly to how a Disneyland ride borrows from whichever film it's based on, Call of the Mountain takes the Horizon experience and condenses it into something much more bitesize while trying to keep the same flavour. This is exemplified best by the Pirates of the Caribbean-like opening, in which your peaceful river cruise is rudely interrupted by the likes of a soaring Stormbird and towering Tallneck dino-bot. It’s a real credit to the work that developer Firesprite has done in translating Guerrilla's original art design into something more impressive than any TV screen could do justice to – both in the stunning vistas this world offers and the trademark machines that populate it.  The first time you see the scale of some of these creatures really is a sight to behold, not only from the shift to true first-person perspective emphasizing their true size, but with their presence felt further thanks to the haptic feedback felt both in each controller and the headset itself: as you quite literally feel the ground shake with every step as these massive machines pass by. It’s a real showcase for the PS VR2 right off the bat, with huge spectacle blending with small detail – right down to the delicate ripples your fingers make in the water and the rude splashes made by the feet of giant machines. Blockbuster opening aside, over the course of its roughly six-hour campaign Call of the Mountain takes the essence of Horizon’s gameplay and boils it down into a much more manageable set of tools that works in VR. Rocky landscapes to explore, hostile machines to take down, puzzles to solve – it's all here. What’s notable, however, is that this is very much a linear experience that stands in sharp contrast to Zero Dawn or Forbidden West’s vast open worlds. An inquisitive mind is occasionally rewarded with fun side activities, such as stacking rock cairns or collectible archery targets to hit, but mostly you’ll be guided down a funneled path. This narrow approach naturally works well in VR, even if some of the inherent exploration that Horizon normally offers is lost. There are two movement options to choose from: a “gesture”-based system that moves you around when holding two buttons and imitating a walking motion with your arms, and a more traditional analog stick-based system. After trying both I opted for the former for most of my playthrough, despite both coming with their pros and cons. At first, the gesture system didn’t strike me as overly intuitive, but once I got to grips with it I preferred it simply because it made me feel far less nauseous when playing for long stretches (by which I mean about 30 minutes). I did, however, find myself switching to the analog sticks whenever entering combat, as the dodge mechanics associated with this moveset (a flick of the right stick) made for a much easier time. Everyone’s mileage on this will obviously vary based on your VR tolerances, so I’d recommend trying out both to see which suits you best. Now’s the time to say that if you suffer from any level of vertigo, this may not be the game for you. I’m not too terrible with real heights, but here I did start to feel a little queasy when looking down at some of the ludicrous distances I could fall from. There are quite a few opportunities for potential plummets as well, thanks to the sheer amount of climbing you’re asked to do. Climbing cliffs. Climbing vines. Climbing ice walls. Climbing rock faces by lodging dual pickaxes into them. Almost so much climbing that you may find yourself wanting to climb the walls of your house as well. Now, I wasn’t naive enough to think that a game called “Call of the Mountain” wouldn’t involve some climbing, but I was taken somewhat off guard when I found that it really is the majority of what you’ll be doing here, especially in the early hours. Climbing isn’t overly challenging, but honestly reaching for handhold after handhold gets quite dull after you’ve scaled your third or fourth outcrop. It does get slightly more interesting once tools such as the grappling Grabcaster are introduced, and the immersion of it all as the wind swirls around your ears and the excellent music swells as you reach the next peak is undeniable. Although some ascents offer slightly more excitement than others, I can honestly say I never found climbing to be consistently fun. It’s frustrating then, that it dominates much of what you’ll be doing in Call of the Mountain, in particular when compared to its much less frequent but infinitely more exciting combat sections. The PlayStation VR2 may seem pricey, given that it costs $150 more than the base PS5 Digital Edition console you’ll need to use it. Even so, it’s such a quantum leap over the original PSVR in terms of ease of use, visual quality, and immersion that any PlayStation owner who loves VR should upgrade as soon as possible. Its 4K HDR OLED screen and excellently tactile Sense controllers are the most obvious improvement, but plentiful quality-of-life changes and the raw horsepower of the PS5 set a new standard for how VR games should play and feel on console. The downside is that, like any new platform, its thin launch lineup makes its lack of backward compatibility with original PSVR games a significant problem, but one that will only improve as Sony and other developers roll out new games that take advantage of the PSVR2’s unique features. – Gabriel Moss, Feburary 16, 2023 Read the full PlayStation VR2 review  Largely taking place in mini arenas, these gladiatorial battles against all manner of unfriendly machine are often the highlight of each mission. It’s where the immersion of it all really beds in as you briefly forget what era of Earth you’re living in and the rhythm of combat takes hold. Armed with the signature Horizon weapon of a bow and arrow, you’ll quickly find yourself aiming for enemy weak points using the PS VR2’s impressive eyeball tracking tech, and then quick-dodging out of the way of flying melee attacks before ducking and weaving your head out of the way of projectiles. It’s a set of combat options that gradually builds over time as well, as new ammo types are introduced and your arsenal expanded. As stronger foes present themselves, naturally more firepower is needed, and with it the levels of excitement to find increase – a thrilling fight against a colossal Thunderjaw being a particular highlight. Preparing yourself for encounters becomes increasingly more important as you build all sorts of elemental arrows in a pleasing crafting system that lets you manually attach arrowheads, explosives, and flights, thus further creating a tangible connection to the world. More gratifying than crafting arrows though is, of course, firing them – and in this regard Call of the Mountain has really nailed it. Now, my real-world archery experience may only stretch as far as giving it a go when 11 years old on a school trip, but in my expert opinion this feels pretty damn good. There’s a real pleasing “ping” to the way each arrow flies off of the bowstring and haptic feedback tickles your palm, and then an even greater thrill as it slams into whatever is unfortunate enough to be in its way and sets them aflame thanks to explosive Blaze. Unlike the climbing, it just never gets old to watch sparks fly and machine parts fall off as the fundamentally brilliant Horizon combat successfully makes its way into the virtual reality space. It’s a highly satisfying cadence that works really well in VR thanks to its enthralling but never overwhelming speed, but is also forgiving if you happen to get blindsided by a roaming Scrapper, for example. If you do manage to take some damage you can find a pocket of peace amongst the mayhem by going for a snack break and refilling your health bar by munching on some fruit. A health bar is smartly located on one of your hands (much like we saw in Half-Life: Alyx) meaning it’s never more than a quick glance away, like checking the time on a watch, and always in view when aiming down sights. All in all, the interface of Call of the Mountain is very cleverly implemented, making it feel like a tangible part of your character and not a series of distracting floating boxes that threaten to take you out of the beautiful world. Puzzles also pop up here and there and, again, serve as a welcome break from climbing. Did I mention there’s a lot of climbing? The problems are sometimes fun but never overly difficult, and once the novelty of actually physically picking up gears and slotting them into position myself wore out they became yet another minor obstacle on the way to the next combat encounter or story moment. That story is serviceable, but one that is definitely engineered in order to facilitate big moments and fun cameos rather than tell a layered tale itself the way the previous two Horizons have. Here you play as Ryas rather than Aloy – he’s a Shadow Carja rebel who must complete a series of tasks in order to atone for his crimes. His internal monologues are mercifully limited in a smart maneuver that allows you to experience this world first-hand yourself and not be distracted by voices in your head. Naturally, things escalate as the plot thickens, and the second half of the campaign becomes much more engaging than the first thanks to the action increasing in both quality and quantity. A personal highlight is the aforementioned Thunderjaw cat and mouse section, which conjures up memories of Jurassic Park at its rousing best. There are a few little nods scattered throughout for big Horizon fans to find of value here – familiar faces like Aloy drop in to say hello – but don’t necessarily come in expecting a dense new chapter in this universe’s lore. Outside the main story you’re free to explore your small home base, take a closer look at artifacts collected on your expeditions, and chat with friends made along the way. It’s also home to the pleasant safari mode: a largely tranquil alternative version of the opening boat cruise which shows off a selection of the Horizon bestiary in its natural habitat. It’s short, sweet, and a reflection of the Disneyland-like nature of Call of the Mountain as a whole – an impressive technical showcase for PS VR2 which uses the inherent wonders of the Horizon world to sprinkle thrills into its sometimes-lazy river ride.  Horizon Call of the Mountain’s exciting highs elevate it just enough above its often monotonous climbing mechanics to create a fun first blockbuster-scale entry into the PS VR2 library. Through intuitive design, awesome spectacle, and gripping combat, Horizon’s first step into virtual reality is one packed with exciting encounters that its slower stretches may sometimes detract from, but never threaten to derail completely. It’s an enjoyable, if not essential, chapter of the Horizon story. "
77,PlayStation VR2 ,9.0,"It’s a thrill when we get to say this about a new piece of gaming hardware: The PlayStation VR 2 is a true generational leap that makes the old one look like a piece of junk. It’s not exactly cheap, but for $549.99 you get a high-end headset with a 4K, HDR-enabled OLED screen, a 110-degree field of view, built-in tracking cameras, and eye tracking, plus two of its slick Sense controllers with the excellent adaptive triggers and haptic feedback Sony introduced with the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller. The catch is that it requires you to be connected to a PS5 by a single USB-C cable, but that means it’s much, much more powerful when it comes to delivering fantastic graphics than a self-contained headset like the Meta Quest 2. With all of that, including a few features you don’t see on even more expensive PC VR headsets like Valve’s Index and HP’s Reverb G2, the PlayStation VR2 has vaulted console VR into the lead in just about every category… except available games. The PlayStation VR2 is an immediate improvement over its predecessor in every way, but the physical design is actually pretty similar. Like its forebear, it’s got a clean black-and-white look that matches your PS5, and it’s built around an adjustable head strap that’s separated from the VR display itself, which does a great job of comfortably accommodating a wide range of head shapes and lets the weight of the screen rest on the top of your head rather than on your face. The one-stop adjustment mechanism on the back of the head strap remains an excellent way to dial in a perfect fit.  It’s nice to see the PS VR2 has a slider on the top-left side of the lens casing to quickly adjust the headset’s interpupillary distance, or IPD, and it’s especially neat that the internal camera quickly measures the distance between your eyes during setup. Other than that Sony has kept the headset itself simple, with just two buttons at the bottom of the display. The center button turns the headset on and off, and the other instantly activates passthrough mode, letting you see the real world around you in black and white without taking off the headset. This is great if you need to adjust your controllers or greet someone who’s entered your play area. That said, it’s slightly disappointing there are no physical buttons to adjust the volume. Everything else about the PS VR2 feels like a quantum leap over any other headset in its price class – save for the HP Reverb G2 which, up until now, has offered a level of fidelity only accessible to PC gamers. This is no longer the case, and the PlayStation VR2 is now the most affordable way to play PC-quality VR games at 4K resolution. Unlike the Reverb G2, however, the PS VR2’s display uses two HDR-enabled 2,000 x 2,040 per-eye OLED panels that operate at up to 120 Hz and offer a 110-degree FOV, rather than the G2’s slightly less glamorous dual 2,160 x 2,160 LCD panels that cap out at 90 Hz and a 98-degree FOV without any support for HDR. As a result, the PlayStation VR2 displays a picture that is smoother, richer, and deeper than anything else on the market today – save for, perhaps, the Meta Quest Pro which costs three times as much. Compared to the original PSVR, setup is a breeze. Instead of a whole bunch of cables and an HDMI switcher that was an absolute chore to deal with – to say nothing of the tracking camera – the PS VR2 has a single 4.5m USB-C cable you plug into your PS5, and… you’re done! After that you’ll need to install a firmware update and then quickly calibrate your controllers, eye tracking, and lens spacing, and the four tracking cameras will capture a scan of your room. It’s extremely cool to see it accurately map out the geometry of a room – and everything in it, including furniture, pets, and even the leftovers on your coffee table. Once you carve out a play area, the PS VR2’s guardian walls rise out of the ground, clearly marking which parts of your room are safe to walk around in. It’s easy to recalibrate or adjust your settings at any point from the main PlayStation 5 settings menu, and anyone familiar with the PS5’s control center won’t have a problem seamlessly navigating between the VR experience and the PS5’s main menu. Still, it’s neat that someone can stand outside of the PS VR2 headset and direct the experience remotely using a DualSense controller. This can make setup way simpler if you’re trying to show off the PS VR2 to someone who doesn’t usually spend time in VR or isn’t familiar with the PS5’s interface. Sony has managed to make its lower-priced PlayStation VR headset competitive where it counts. Despite its relatively low resolution it looks very good in games, and the headset is comfortable to wear and easy to use after you’ve dealt with its many wires. Paired with the Move controllers it provides good but sometimes flakey motion tracking on your hands, but the PlayStation Camera’s limited viewing angle is a weakness, and so is its inability to see behind you. Should you run out and buy one? That depends. The technology is astonishing but still in its infancy, and VR games that rival current console blockbusters are a long way off, so it won’t be as immediately useful as you might expect for a $400 to $500 price. However, it’s a lot of fun to be on the forefront of something as exciting as VR. Some of the best times I’ve had with my VR headsets are from wowing people who come over and try it for the first time, and that never gets old. If you’ve only ever used the PSVR’s Move controllers, the moment you grab onto the included pair of Sense controllers is a revelation. The layout of their clicky face buttons and analog sticks will feel familiar to anyone who has played room-scale VR in the last several years, but they step things up with the addition of haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. The analog sticks are half the size of the DualSense’s, but remain tactile, allowing almost the same degree of precision as a D-Pad when playing a game of Tetris Effect: Connected, which is notoriously difficult to play on the Quest 2’s default Touch controllers. Each button also features capacitive touch that can tell if your fingers are on it or not, which allows you to make reasonably accurate gestures with your hands. It’s not quite as sophisticated as the finger tracking on the Valve Index controllers, though, so you’re limited to specific gestures like giving a thumbs up or pointing with your index finger. In games like Horizon Call of the Mountain and Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge, you can feel the power of drawing a virtual bowstring or shooting a virtual blaster through the resistance of the adaptive triggers. Haptic feedback improves this effect by simulating certain forces, textures, and noises through dynamic vibrations. This can be felt in everything from smashing a large shipping container with your Godzilla-sized tentacles in Tentacular to tackling an opponent in 2MD: VR Football Unleashed – but it’s at its most impressive when producing subtle but accurate vibrations for calmer interactions, such as gliding your paddle against the flow of water in Kayak VR Mirage, where you can almost feel the resistance of the water through the Sense controller’s haptic vibrations. Of course, just like with the DualSense, battery life is a concern here: with all that vibrating and resisting, a full charge only lasts around four to five hours. That’s a long time for a session of VR gaming, but the fact that you can’t swap out batteries for a fresh pair means you might get cut short if you forget to plug them in. Likewise, the Sense controllers’ ring design may take some getting used to – it can be difficult to figure out where your hands are supposed to go by touch, which adds a little hassle to the joy of introducing someone new to VR. But they’re comfortable to hold once you get a grip. In contrast to the OLED panel included in the original PSVR, the PS VR2’s 4K HDR OLED panel offers richer colors and up to a 120Hz refresh rate, making even less visually detailed games come to life. The screen door effect was never an issue with the PSVR, and it isn’t here either, but with proper IPD calibration, you can now tactically eliminate glare as well. The fact that you’re encompassed by 110 degrees of scenery at all times makes VR all the more lifelike. That’s 10 degrees wider than the original PSVR, and it’s a significant difference in how much of the world around you is visible. It’s still a bit like wearing a SCUBA mask, but it’s a bigger, less-claustrophobic SCUBA mask. Simply put, the PS VR2 is by far the most gorgeous headset in the $500 price range. The PS VR2’s access to the PS5’s graphical horsepower allows its games to have vast draw distances, much like their flatscreen counterparts, and there’s no better demonstration of this than in Horizon Call of the Mountain. You can see fully simulated mechanical creatures running around across the map, contrasted against cascading waterfalls and picturesque mountaintops reflecting light in the distance. Similarly, Cities VR: Enhanced Edition allows you to build urban sprawls that truly come alive from a distance – and now you can see all of it, all at once. On top of that, the PS VR2 has a fancy new trick called foveated rendering, which means its built-in IR camera tracks the movement of your eyes and uses that information to improve efficiency. Because it knows exactly what you’re focused on, it can put all its processing power into making that area super detailed, while everything else can be dialed down to conserve resources. It’s also neat that certain games can now allow you to select menu options with your eyes, or toggle interactions just by glancing at a character. The only other headset available right now that can do this is the Meta Quest Pro, and that’ll cost you $1,500. Horizon Call of the Mountain’s exciting highs elevate it just enough above its often monotonous climbing mechanics to create a fun first blockbuster-scale entry into the PS VR2 library. Through intuitive design, awesome spectacle, and gripping combat, Horizon’s first step into virtual reality is one packed with exciting encounters that its slower stretches may sometimes detract from, but never threaten to derail completely. It’s an enjoyable, if not essential, chapter of the Horizon story. –Simon Cardy, February 16, 2023Horizon Call of the Mountain reviewPulse 3D wireless headphones. Unfortunately, you’re out of luck if you’re hoping any of this will work with your existing PSVR game catalog. Because of how big an improvement it is, PS VR2 represents a clean slate for PlayStation’s entire VR library, so even if you’ve spent hundreds of dollars on PSVR games that made the list of PS VR2 games in the launch window, you’ll have to buy them again (though a few publishers have announced free PS VR2 upgrades for existing PSVR games). And considering that there just aren’t a ton of new games announced yet, it might be a while before the PS VR2 catches up to other platforms in terms of selection. But hey, it has Beat Saber, and what more do you really need? The PlayStation VR2 is initially available through PlayStation Direct for $549.99 with two Sense controllers, a single USB-C cable, and auxiliary earbuds. PlayStation Direct currently offers a $599.99 bundle containing Horizon Call of the Mountain at a $10 discount.  The PlayStation VR2 may seem pricey, given that it costs $150 more than the base PS5 Digital Edition console you’ll need to use it. Even so, it’s such a quantum leap over the original PSVR in terms of ease of use, visual quality, and immersion that any PlayStation owner who loves VR should upgrade as soon as possible. Its 4K HDR OLED screen and excellently tactile Sense controllers are the most obvious improvement, but plentiful quality-of-life changes and the raw horsepower of the PS5 set a new standard for how VR games should play and feel on console. The downside is that, like any new platform, its thin launch lineup makes its lack of backward compatibility with original PSVR games a significant problem, but one that will only improve as Sony and other developers roll out new games that take advantage of the PSVR2’s unique features. "
78,Deliver Us Mars ,6.0,"Just before my group of four young astronauts with major, personal conflicts of interest blast off to the red planet, I'm assured by our team leader that, while some corners had to be cut to get our ship spaceworthy, it should do its job just fine. And it does… kind of. Which is a great metaphor for Deliver Us Mars as a whole. This platforming, puzzle-solving, interplanetary adventure is trying to do too much with too little, and it ends up touching down just North of adequate. The backstory for our plucky, rebellious, sometimes even endearing hero, Kathy, is that she was separated from her father Isaac just before he boarded a colonization mission bound for Mars. Years later, she's been through astronaut school on a climate-ravaged Earth and a mysterious transmission from Isaac spurs her and her older sister, Claire, to seek seats on the mission to bring the colony ships back. Periodic flashbacks do a respectable job of filling in the complicated and painful story of their family along the way.  The launch sequence from Cape Canaveral is among the strongest. It has you perform various checks and landing procedures that feel authentic and tactile before watching through the front window as your ship, the Zephyr, leaves Earth's atmosphere with no cuts or loading screens. You're not briefed on any of these procedures ahead of time, which led to a lot of me swiveling my mouse pointer around frantically trying to find the highlighted switch for the internal power interval or whatever, but it was neat once I got the hang of it. Outside these scripted sequences, Deliver Us Mars consists of first- and third-person explorations of an orbital facility and the surface of Mars itself, featuring some fairly simple puzzle-solving and occasional, frustrating platforming. There are several sections where you have to bounce wireless power beams around, matching the voltage on doors and terminals to get to the next area. They're generally not too difficult, but I found some of the trickier ones satisfying to solve. What wasn't nearly as satisfying were these obnoxious climbing wall segments. You have to click the left and right mouse button at the same time to grab onto a wall to begin with, and you have to do so with enough room that you don't slide off of the climbing surface. But this action is so unresponsive that whether you can get a purchase or not feels more random than anything, especially in some cases where you have to jump at an angle. Also, one of the moves you need to progress in some of the later segments is never explained at all, and I discovered it by accident when I was just trying out random buttons in frustration after I'd been stuck for several minutes. Pro tip: You can hold S and press spacebar to jump to a wall that's behind you. This lack of direction even extends to some segments of the main story where you have several different ways you can go, but aren't told at all which is the right one and can end up wandering way off in the wrong direction. There is an option under Accessibility to always display quest markers, and while I don't necessarily need a big star constantly guiding my every step, it could really use some sort of middle ground. If you tell me to go to Ark Vita without ever giving me a hint about where it is, that seems like you're really leaving me to twist in the wind. At least the characters are endearing. What few of them there are, anyway. Neil Newborn (whom you may remember as Resident Evil: Village's maniacal Heisenberg) gives a great performance as Isaac, a complex character with conflicted motivations. Kathy herself is brought to life by Ellise Chappell, who gives a convincing performance with a wide emotional range. And the story is respectable, with the mystery of what happened to the Martian colonists pulling me forward at each turn. The character models can't really keep up with it, though. They have a very doll-like, uncanny valley look to them – when we get to see their faces at all. A lot of backstory is delivered through these pre-recorded holograms where hairless, faceless crash test dummies pose in place while dialogue plays. It really looks like placeholder art you'd see in an unfinished game, and the developers just never had the time or resources to replace it. There is also a whole chapter toward the end that jumps from one scene to something completely unrelated, giving me the sense that they cut a significant amount of plot without doing a very good job of stitching it back together. Performance, especially during cutscenes, is also a major issue. My RTX 3080-powered system exceeds the recommended specs, but in many cinematics I would see my framerate drop below 10 fps, even with DLSS on. I had to turn off the per-strand hair rendering altogether because it kept glitching out. In regular gameplay, it's usually fine. But this is clearly not a very well-optimized project. A rousing mystery brought to life by a great voice cast and nuanced character writing can't really save Deliver Us Mars from its shortcomings. Poor technical performance during cutscenes and backstory that is too often delivered by these barely-differentiated mannequins make it difficult to get sucked into this extraterrestrial world. Even when it’s running smoothly, frustrating climbing and platforming mechanics are just a chore to get through so that you can reach the more clever puzzles and rewarding exploration that break up the annoyances with moments of wonder and satisfaction. But I could never shake the feeling that Deliver Us Mars simply bit off more dehydrated astronaut food than it could chew. "
79,Wild Hearts Review in Progress,8.0,"Do you dream of the chance to get dropkicked by a lava-monkey the size of a building? Of course you do, and goodness gracious is Wild Hearts excited to make that dream a reality. Omega Force and EA’s take on co-op monster hunting is a remarkably familiar one, mixing on-the-fly building mechanics into enormous elemental animal fights across its gorgeous feudal Japanese locations. But even when its crystal clear inspirations can sometimes lead to comparisons that aren’t always flattering for Wild Hearts, the few dozen hours I’ve spent with it so far have been a ton of fun, and I’m excited to keep grinding for materials as I progress toward the end of its campaign and into the endgame. Let me be perfectly blunt: it’s nearly impossible to talk about Wild Hearts without bringing up Monster Hunter. That’s not to say this is an egregious rip-off or completely unoriginal, as it provides plenty of interesting additions and fun little twists all its own. But in pretty much every way that counts, Wild Hearts is so fundamentally Monster Hunter that you could very easily mistake it for the newest game in Capcom’s series if it weren’t for the name. That’s true of its giant monster-slaying missions, its crafting-based equipment progression with drastically different weapon types, its campaign structure continuously escalating and remixing previous encounters, and even its fine but ignorable story of a hub town investigating why local creatures have unexpectedly started attacking outside of their usual territory.  Importantly, Wild Hearts at least plays this recognizable part very well, making it one of the easiest recommendations I could make to any current Monster Hunter fan looking for new prey. Its combat captures that excellent mix of tactical and terrifying, pushing you to pick your moments carefully against foes many times your size who can often make your health bar disappear in the blink of an eye. It’s as much about learning the ins and outs of each monster, your weapons, and even the terrain around you as it is about actually executing the right button inputs. But because Wild Hearts is not actually a Monster Hunter game, it gets to leave behind certain legacy mechanics that have started to feel a little dated as Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise continue to streamline and modernize that two-decade-old series. I didn’t miss things like weapon sharpening or cluttered inventory management, and the simplified nature of stuff like stat-boosting food and support items means I feel like I’m spending more time out in the field and less on pre-hunt prep. So far Wild Hearts also seems to have lost some of the complexity I enjoy about Monster Hunter along with those clunkier parts, but this ground-up approach means it’s far easier to recommend to brand-new hunters, too. The biggest way Wild Hearts sets itself apart is in its karakuri building system, which allows you to both create tactical objects like walls or springboards in the middle of combat as well as place structures like fast-travel tents or ziplines anywhere across its four hunting maps. This system is excellent, with the number of structures you can build limited enough to make me really consider where best to build a custom base camp or a convenient shortcut while still being flexible and open enough that I never had to overthink it, either. It turns the wonderfully detailed maps into little puzzles to be solved in whatever way you see fit, rather than simply arenas to fight in. During those fights, karakuri play the role of quick-use support items – though everything you place sticks around until it’s destroyed (either by you or a monster), so battlefields can often be strewn with the remnants of past encounters in a pretty neat way. You can summon simple blocks to jump off of or build walls, springs to launch you in any direction, or torches to give you a fast fire attack. It’s an interesting mechanic, but it really shines when you start unlocking fusion karakuri, which let you stack these basic objects in specific patterns to make special constructs like huge bombs or chain traps. This ends up feeling like a mini combo system to master, and adds some nice consistency across all the weapon types. Outside of those karakuri, each of the eight different weapons play very differently from one another. There are your simple-to-understand options like a middle-of-the-road katana, giant but slow hammer, or… well, literally just a gun. But there are also a couple of unique choices like the quick, bladed umbrella that’s built around parrying attacks. Wild Hearts’ combat is always a fun dance of reading attack patterns and timing both strikes and dodges well, but it was also a little daunting until I found the weapon that clicked with me: the Claw Blade. This fast-slicing knife also lets you pretty much fly through the air after hooking onto a monster, making for some absolutely epic moments as you strike from above. The monsters themselves are all pretty fun to fight too, with their cool and creative designs each boiling down to “normal animal plus elemental type multiplied by big.” Fights can be a real challenge when you’re playing solo (which is how I’ve spent most of my time so far, since the pre-launch server population is low), and it’s always satisfying to learn their behaviors and turn an initially hard encounter into something trivial through practice and grinding alone. My main issue at this point is that the amount and variety of monsters seems pretty low, with different elemental variants or just stronger “Mighty” versions being introduced almost right away. Those don’t look that different or feel like totally new enemies to fight, so while I’m still having fun for now, I could see it wearing thin if things aren’t shaken up down the line. That’s also a symptom of Wild Hearts’ structure, with a campaign that is quick to put you up against a foe it’s confident you won’t be able to beat without preparation. That means collecting monster parts to craft new armor or upgrading your weapons through a sprawling tech tree. It’s another very familiar system, but so far there’s less to tinker with here to eek out little advantages than I’m accustomed to as a Monster Hunter veteran – you can’t increase the armor rating of a piece of equipment individually, just make new pieces, and the only way to customize weapons is through a small handful of perks they can inherit as you upgrade them. That means these difficulty spikes incentivize you to grind for armor and weapons tailored toward beating the gatekeeping monster specifically, which is a lot less empowering than finding the direction that most interests me and crafting a build that makes it work. That all said, I have a lot more Wild Hearts left to play, and right now I am excited to do so. Its equipment systems seem simpler than that of Monster Hunter, but that can be both a good thing and a bad thing, so only time will tell if it’s worth digging deep into. I also hope its monster variety gets more meaningful as I go further, but I’m far from bored yet with what I’ve seen already. All that’s left is to keep hunting and see what the campaign (and the endgame) have in store for me, and I’ll be back with a final scored review for its launch on the February 16 once I have.  If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Koei Tecmo’s Omega Force is using Wild Hearts to flirt hard with Capcom right now. But using a beloved game as the template for a new one isn’t necessarily a bad thing, and Wild Hearts manages to introduce plenty of fun new ideas to the Monster Hunter formula while recapturing it well enough to stand proudly alongside the series that so clearly inspired it. The way it simplifies and streamlines things makes for a slightly shallower package, but its karakuri building adds a fresh new way to interact with the map in its place. And while its lower monster variety is certainly disappointing, I’m still having enough fun that I’m excited to party up with some friends and dive back into both challenging endgame fights and fanciful karakuri decorations alike. "
80,Hogwarts Legacy ,9.0,"Like many, I’ve been waiting for a truly excellent Harry Potter game since I was in the third grade. In that time, we’ve gotten some respectable LEGO Potter games, an underwhelming EA Sports Quidditch game for some reason, and even suffered through the fevered nightmare that is Harry Potter Kinect. But none of these has come close to fulfilling that fantasy of receiving a Hogwarts admission letter that opens the door to a secret world. With Hogwarts Legacy, I’m happy to say that we finally got a Harry Potter game that captures some of that magic. Its open world map absolutely nails the vibe of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, it has spellcasting combat that’s stupefyingly good, the characters that inhabit it are charming and unforgettable, and it is positively brimming with countless diversions to soak up dozens of hours of your time. It may not be the most impressive technical achievement and it is certainly cursed with a lack of enemy variety, but none of Hogwarts Legacy’s issues can cast a Descendo charm on this triumphant visit to the Wizarding World.   Right in line with most Harry Potter tales before it, Legacy’s plot has more holes than a fishnet stocking and sorta just expects you to accept that its magical world makes no sense. This mystical third-person action-adventure RPG begins with you transferring to Hogwarts as a fifth-year witch or wizard (for unexplained reasons) to do everything from attending classes to fighting giant spiders with a magical stick to flying around on a hippogriff. The fantastic character creator has plenty of options for you to craft your ideal witch or wizard (apart from a fairly limited voice selection), and as soon as you do they’ll immediately become entangled in a conflict between the Wizarding World and an evil goblin. On top of that, because being in a secret society of wizards is apparently not exciting enough, you soon discover that you’ve got some freaky super-charged magical abilities that allow you to do extra cool stuff that also isn’t really explained. If you’re like me, you’ll roll your eyes during moments when you’re introduced to 100 years’ worth of dead characters lecturing you from paintings about the importance of some stuff that happened a long time ago and how you have to save the world or whatever. But once that’s over with Legacy mostly redeems itself with a fantastic cast of non-painting characters that help boil things down into a not-too-convoluted good-guys-versus-bad-guys conflict that ends up being an enjoyable tale, even if it's not particularly profound or original. The characters you’ll spend most of your time with are the classmates who will befriend you on campus, accompany you on certain quests, and help you hone your abilities as a magic user. Most are memorable and instantly endearing, like Sebastian the cocky and morally pliable Slytherin, or Natsai the clever and unflappable Gryffindor, and spending time with them and improving your social links through their relationship questlines made my stay at Hogwarts all the more enjoyable. The elephant in the room with Hogwarts Legacy is Harry Potter’s creator, J.K. Rowling, whose comments about transgender people in recent years have left a sour taste in the mouths of many current and former Potter fans, both at IGN and in the world at large. This has driven some to call for a boycott of the Wizarding World altogether – including Hogwarts Legacy, though Rowling was not directly involved and there are good reasons (both in-game and out) to believe the developers at Avalanche don’t necessarily share her views. Regardless, IGN has always and will continue to champion human rights causes and support people speaking with their wallets in whatever manner they choose. As critics, our job is to answer the question of whether or not we find Hogwarts Legacy to be fun to play and why; whether it’s ethical to play is a separate but still very important question. So just as in virtually all cases, we’re choosing to expose and address the views of the franchise creator separately from our consideration of the work of the hundreds of game developers and evaluate Hogwarts Legacy as it stands, leaving behind-the-scenes context to be considered in addition to that evaluation, rather than in place of it, so that it can be weighted according to your own values. Unexpectedly, I even found myself looking forward to hanging out with my professors, whether it was my main man Professor Fig, who serves as both something of a mentor and as a sidekick, or the wise-cracking charms teacher Professor Ronen, who made me love him mostly by making fun of me. Each of these characters feels like an indispensable piece of the school, and you can find them wandering the halls doing their thing and choose to spend time with your favorites. It’s a huge and important part of the Hogwarts fantasy that Legacy just knocks out of the park. Even better, though, is the world itself, which is just packed with nearly everything I wanted in a Potter game and more. You’ll find yourself exploring Hogwarts’ stone-cobbled halls and secret passageways, flying around the Forbidden Forest on a broomstick, and exploring dark caves lit only by the glow of your Lumos spell. The developers at Avalanche have so brilliantly captured the look and feel of the Wizarding World that I was amazed at just being there, no matter what trivial errand they had me wrapped up in. That immersion can occasionally be broken by Legacy’s dicey performance, though, which suffered from just about every issue that makes IGN’s performance review team cry during my time playing on PlayStation 5. Those greatest hits include framerate inconsistency, weird issues where the lighting switches from too dark to too bright, aggressive pop-in while moving around the map quickly, and more. There’s even this weird thing where every door in Hogwarts has a brief loading screen. It’s understandable since there’s so much packed into this beast of an adventure, but the PS5’s promises of the death of loading screens haven’t quite been lived up to here as it’s clearly struggling to keep up with the spellcraft and whimsy of the Wizarding World.  Beyond the performance issues, Legacy is also a fairly glitchy adventure in general. You’ll probably fall through the map a time or two, or see a character or object get caught in the environment, or maybe even have the person you’re talking to just up and walk away from you in the middle of a conversation, leaving you to speak with the empty spot they were standing in for about two minutes. I didn’t encounter anything game-breaking or so common that you’ll likely want to curse its name, but things like this do happen enough to be an irritation. As someone who finds the wand-whipping combat in the movies fairly dull, I was very concerned about Hogwart Legacy’s ability to keep my attention after slinging spells for dozens of hours, but I can admit when I’m wrong – the combat is fantastic, challenging, and utterly captivating. There’s a lot more to it than shooting balls of light out of a stick! Instead, the trick is in dodging and countering enemy attacks while pulling off creative combos. For example, you can pull enemies towards you with Accio, light them on fire with the close-range Incendio, then blow them away with the explosive Bombarda spell. Chaining together abilities to make your opponents look like complete fools never stops being amusing, especially as you unlock talent tree perks that enhance your skills with modifiers that make your elemental spells fork to nearby enemies or transform into AoE attacks. Many of the combat encounters are legitimately challenging too – I’ll admit I died my fair share of times while trying to show off a new set of spells or neglecting to see the goblin sneaking up behind me. Improving your skills and figuring out which spells work best for you is a really entertaining process, filled with experimentation and the occasional maiming. There’s even a perfect parry mechanic, which begs to be mastered by tryhards like me looking for that extra dopamine hit that comes from a timely block at the last possible second. You’ll also be forced to change up your tactics regularly, since many enemies have color-coded shields that can only be broken by spells of a particular type. For example, enemies with a red shield won’t be damaged until you hit them with a fire-based spell, which means you’ll need to keep a few of those handy. While the combat system never stops being entertaining, the creatures you fight soon run out of tricks up their sleeves. You’ll see the same familiar faces a lot, as you spend an enormous amount of your time fighting dark wizards, spiders, and goblins. Every once in a while they’ll trot out the same repeated troll enemy or nondescript magical suit of armor as well, but the enemies Legacy throws at you wear thin pretty quick. That’s a shame, since the Harry Potter universe is known for having all manner of beasts and villains to face off against, and yet here there’s practically no variety. What’s especially weird is that it’s not like there aren’t other enemy types to be found in Legacy – you’ll find giant, evil frogs and zombies roaming about, to name a few – it’s just that they’re scarcely used in any of the main dungeons or levels. Instead, they send about 500 spiders at you in a row, which is a baffling decision. Because you can only have so many spells equipped at any time, the one part of combat that’s a bit of a drag is the somewhat clunky process for switching between, which takes some serious getting used to. You learn quite a number of spells by the end of the roughly 30+ hour campaign and constantly have to reslot which ones you’ve got equipped; keeping them organized and committed to memory becomes a challenge in its own right, and not the kind I relish. When you’re not lighting spiders on fire, you’ll need some lighter activities to spend your time with, and it’s actually kind of crazy just how many side tasks Legacy gives you! You could spend hours decorating your very own personal space in the Room of Requirement; go around catching, grooming, and breeding all manner of fantastic beasts (if you know where to find them); practice your gardening or potion making; go shopping in Hogsmeade; become a champion duelist in an underground dueling ring with your classmates; or even go full Voldemort and decide you want to become a master of the Dark Arts by learning the Killing Curse and other unspeakable acts (which goes about as well as you’d expect if you choose to pursue it). It’s not just easy to waste dozens of hours goofing off – I found it downright difficult to not get distracted by a dozen things and forget what I’d originally set out to do. I was able to get through the main story in 32 hours, but even though I was in something of a hurry to complete it I found staying on task almost impossible. As soon as I finished I immediately went back to do more side quests and continue exploring (which you can do freely after finishing, since there doesn’t appear to be a New Game+ mode currently). I will say though, with the wizarding buffet of endless ways to waste your time, it’s a pretty glaring omission that Quidditch is nowhere to be found. The lore reason for a lack of the iconic broom-based sport is that it’s been banned for one year thanks to some pureblood wimp who got injured last year, but that feels like an effort to paper over the absence of a major aspect of Harry Potter’s time at Hogwarts that the developers must’ve just not had time to include.  One of the ways you can completely forget about the looming goblin threat in the main story is by engaging in the over 100 side quests that are packed into the adventure. Not all of these diversions are equally entertaining – some are definitely your basic “go here and kill/collect this thing” errands that do little more than burn some time – but many feature one of the aforementioned awesome characters asking for you to solve their problems or help them get into good ol’ fashioned mischief. Those are especially great reasons to slow down and immerse yourself in this world, like when you go to class to learn how to pot plants that try to eat you or help a classmate who’s getting picked on. Legacy just gives you lots of reasons to drink in the experience of being a student at Hogwarts, and the novelty of that doesn’t wear off even when you’ve been sent on some meaningless fetch quest. It also helps that you’re often appropriately rewarded for your efforts, whether that’s earning some gear to upgrade your stats, cosmetic items to improve your swagger, or best of all: new spells, the ultimate carrot in a game where you're often limited only by what magic you know how to cast. For example, one sidequest gives you the Alohomora spell, which – in classic Metroidvania fashion – allows you to literally unlock doors and get into places previously inaccessible to you. Collecting spells goes a long way to opening up the map and giving you a better bag of tricks during combat, and I found myself positively thirsting for as many of these game-changing abilities as I could get my grubby paws on. The gear that you’ll find doesn’t really allow you to create full-on “builds” per say, but you’ll gain some resistances and buffs to your character and can spend some time upgrading and modifying your best items for minor improvements. None of it is particularly game-changing stuff, but it managed to capture my attention enough for me to spend a good chunk of time looking at my equipment. Of course, the real loot game is about the cosmetics, a fact that Legacy seems to be keenly aware of since they find ways to hide cool-looking clothes all over the place. These items don’t have any gameplay impact, but pimping out my Slytherin legend to outshine all the kids from the lesser houses is more than enough of a motivation. Best of all, you can overwrite the appearance of any gear you’ve got equipped with the look of anything you’ve acquired so far, which is just fantastic.  However, if you’re as much of a loot hoarder as I am and were hoping to gather up all the treasures in the world and dump them in a closet like in Skyrim you’ll be painfully disappointed by Legacy’s abysmal inventory space, which only lets you hold a couple dozen items and aggravatingly fills up in no time at all. This means you’ll miss out on tons of items early on unless you go to your menu and decide which precious treasure to throw overboard every time you open a chest. Later on you can upgrade your inventory ever so slightly, but even then it never stops being a major pain in the cockatrice to juggle your inventory all the time. In nearly every way, Hogwarts Legacy is the Harry Potter RPG I’ve always wanted to play. Its open-world adventure captures all the excitement and wonder of the Wizarding World with its memorable new characters, challenging and nuanced combat, and a wonderfully executed Hogwarts student fantasy that kept me glued to my controller for dozens of hours. It’s certainly weighed down by technical issues, a lackluster main story, and some poor enemy variety, but even those couldn’t come close to breaking its enchanting spell over me. "
81,Hi-Fi Rush ,9.0,"The last thing I expected from developer Tango Gameworks was a vibrant, fun-loving action game with the heart of a cartoon I would’ve absolutely loved. The studio’s primarily known for the dark and creepy likes of The Evil Within or Ghostwire: Tokyo, but Hi-Fi Rush is instead filled with a joyous, youthful personality seen in its stunning animation, art style, and characters. And while the surprising change of pace is already refreshing, Tango’s greatest accomplishment is how it expertly executes on the singular concept that permeates Hi-Fi Rush’s design — that rhythm is everything. Right from the jump, Hi-Fi Rush establishes its reverence for modern garage and alt-rock, kicking things off by using The Black Keys’ “Lonely Boy” to introduce the cheesy but endearing protagonist Chai and the colorful, high-tech industrialized world he lives in. Labeled a “defect” by robotics megacorp Vandelay Industries after a surgical mishap leaves him with an iPod stuck in his chest, Chai can see and feel the pulse of his music coursing through the world around him. From that point on, nearly everything is impressively tied to the rhythm of Hi-Fi Rush’s soundtrack as this boyish goofball bashes Vandelay robots with a makeshift sword in the shape of a Gibson Flying V.  This playful setup sets a strong tone, and things only get better from there as Hi-Fi Rush layers on a fantastic crew of allies, charismatic villains, and bombastic fights — and often wrapped in a poignant satire of our tech dystopia. It's done with effortless humor and some genuinely warm moments. From so many angles, Hi-Fi Rush is able to showcase its uniquely charming spirit. At its best, Hi-Fi Rush’s combat creates a unique harmonious flow where music is your guide every step of the way. Chai always executes his attacks on the beat regardless of your own input timing, but keeping in rhythm with the BGM’s BPM rewards you with extra damage rather than punishing any missed notes. Using a similar foundation as Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, each combat encounter across the roughly 10-12 hour campaign is graded on completion speed, elegance, and the ability to stay on beat with combos, but that constant tie to the music results in a type of satisfaction I just don’t get from other stylish-action games. This rhythmic system leaves no ambiguity in combo timing and paces itself in a way that allows for room to consider each follow-up move. Deciding whether I should use a light or heavy attack to mix up my combo string, a dodge or parry in anticipation of incoming hits, the grappling hook to close the gap on targets, or a summon to have a companion break shields or stun enemies never felt overwhelming since I could just pace myself to the music. It doesn’t linger on any one concept or gimmick for too long either, steadily throwing in new ideas to toy with before bringing them all together to test my mastery, which meant I never felt like I was simply hammering away to a basic 4/4 time signature. Every enemy’s attack pattern also plays by the same rules. Whether it be charge-ups, AoEs, sword slashes, or projectiles, the rhythm let me confidently avoid telegraphed attacks and approach them like a dancing rhythm game. Sometimes that inspiration even becomes more explicit – tougher foes and some bosses break into brief standalone rhythmic quick time event minigames that require a sequence of parries to counter their last-ditch efforts and deliver a final blow. The rhythm game die-hard in me got hyped every single time I had to do this, and getting perfect strings of parries left me nodding in satisfaction. In fact, one boss fight solely based on this concept is still my favorite encounter, even after some bombastic battles with dazzling spectacles in the late-game. My natural ability to clap on two and four wasn’t enough to get past Hi-Fi Rush’s tougher battles. Enemies gradually evolve in complexity with different offensive styles, and things can get chaotic in encounters that mix and match enemy types. The targeting system did leave me in precarious positions on occasion – since there’s no manual lock-on, I’d sometimes hook onto or gravitate towards enemies I didn’t intend to target, leaving me vulnerable or swinging at the wrong foe. That can become a problem when Hi-Fi Rush layers on flame-wielding robots and electrified floors, for example, but it works well-enough for most fights. Thankfully, with all the tools at my disposal, I could overcome any moments of frustration by changing my approach or at least playing it safer. Because music is the driving force behind Hi-Fi Rush’s design, anything that syncs to the beat through audio cues is also represented with distinct visual cues. For example, powerful combo finishers called Beat Hits use colored circles to show their proper timing, while big incoming attacks leave AoE markers on the ground that change color to the beat to indicate when they’ll land. Additionally, you can activate an on-screen metronome at any point to help keep time more explicitly. I can’t be the judge of whether or not it’s enough from an accessibility standpoint, but those who may struggle with rhythm games or need assistance with the audio do have some options here, and it’s worth acknowledging the importance of including them and the effort put forth to level the playing field. The closer you look at Hi-Fi Rush’s world, the more you see how deep the rhythmic ethos runs. Chai’s footsteps, his snapping idle animation, the pulsing light rings on his robotic cat companion 808, the trees and rocks bouncing in the environment, and even building infrastructure all move to the groove – this level of meticulous detail shows the whole world is in on the action. No matter where you turn, someone or something is jamming out to the same song as you. That attention to detail is still one of the most impressive parts of Hi-Fi Rush, and it gives a sense of momentum into an already vivid world. Platforming and puzzle sections between the staged combat encounters operate on the same principles, with platforms and key objects retracting and moving to the same beat. There’s no mistake when it comes to timing – Hi-Fi Rush can’t pull any cheap tricks or hit you with inexplicable difficulty spikes when it always plays by the same rules. The beat establishes a ruleset and dance you understand, nailing the timing is about seeing the environment as an extension of the music. That said, for as slick as it is on a conceptual level, movement during platforming isn’t quite as fluid as it is during combat. The consequences aren’t dire for misjudging a jump, but the fact that you can do so fairly easily is still a minor but noticeable inconvenience. While the harmonious fusion of rhythm and action is an outstanding achievement, what makes Hi-Fi Rush truly memorable is seeing its charismatic crew and world come to life. Chai’s great as the goofy, irreverent everyman, but it’s the supporting cast that makes the journey feel whole. Peppermint is the slick badass who’s the brains behind the operation to take down Vandelay’s band of comically evil executives. She steals every scene she’s in, and in many ways, this story is more about her. 808 acts as a vessel for the squad to communicate, but she’s also an adorable little baby tiger who’ll steal your heart simply doing cat things. Macaron is the big softie whose adorable demeanor contrasts with his brute force capabilities. It’s a strong dynamic in a crew of lovable personalities shining brighter than the protagonist himself – sorry Chai, you’re cool but I wish I could take control of your cooler friends on this journey! Hi-Fi Rush breathes life into these characters with some of the best animation in games, period. Cutscenes let their personalities shine bright as they fight to the beat and express themselves in such charming fashion. They’re also critical to call in during battle, and I always loved seeing their partner attacks play out. The camera cuts for tandem special moves are sweet as hell, too. Juggling an air combo and finishing it off with Peppermint’s partner attack where she whips out a massive laser beam or Macaron’s ground pound never gets old. They’re also super effective against the toughest foes and it really sells the idea that taking down Vandelay is a team effort. My time with Hi-Fi Rush didn’t end after rolling credits. Upon finishing the main story, you’ll unlock Rhythm Tower, which is a fun series of continuous combat trials that get increasingly difficult. And you’ll get a chapter select, which is handy for accessing certain parts of levels that were previously locked. It’s a boon for me since I just wanted more reasons to keep playing and wrecking robots in tougher battles. Finishing up the mural at the hideout and earning songs for the jukebox were also neat incentives I was happy to chase down by completing in-game challenges. Part of me was bummed to finish the story, but these endgame perks are a treat. There are so many cute quirks that ensure they just don’t end up as supporting characters in the background and they naturally bounce off each other and the villains. Genuinely funny dialogue, impeccable comedic timing, and superb voice performances make warmhearted and laugh-out-loud moments possible. And that stayed consistent throughout the entire story, even bringing a tear to my eye as I marched towards the conclusion. There’s also an amalgamation of nerd culture references that surprisingly fit the tone and a bunch of clever little goofs and gags with some sobering satire of modern work culture and the tech industry within a capitalist dystopia. Hi-Fi Rush makes melding all these seemingly disparate elements look effortless. While Hi-Fi Rush is filled with tons of original music, licensed tracks are interspersed to define key moments and make for some sick needle drops, like Number Girl’s “Inazawa Chainsaw” coming on during an exciting getaway. These aren’t just licensed songs for the sake of having them either, because they also play by the rules of Hi-Fi Rush’s universe, layering on instrumentation and matching the beat of the world –  for example, Nine Inch Nails’ “1,000,000” and “The Perfect Drug” play for their respective bosses, only progressing through the whole song as you get deeper into the fight’s phases. Yet neither of those examples come close to the flawless implementation of The Prodigy’s electro-punk tune “Invaders Must Die”, genuinely invigorating me to tear through robotic hordes and barrel towards the end, or The Joy Formidable’s “Whirring” to really capture that bittersweet feeling. Between those moments of licensed spectacle, Hi-Fi Rush bounces off the beat of original tracks from composers Shuichi Kobori and Reo Uratani, which replicate the modern garage rock sound nicely. These songs tend to blend into the background; catchy enough to get me to tap my foot as I’m playing but mostly serving their purpose as a guide for combat and puzzle timing rather than standout songs of their own. Outside of one, I’m not sure if I can hum a melody or recall a specific song off the in-house tracklist. It may also be a symptom of having every other aspect of Hi-Fi Rush be outstanding that anything that’s simply “good” gets lost in the shuffle. However, that aforementioned stand out track comes from a late-game stage that, dare I say, gives me Persona vibes. Upbeat acid jazz with a Rhodes piano backed by sharp orchestral strings and funky guitars as I pull up to infiltrate a gaudy museum? Madarame, eat your heart out. I thought to myself, I’ve been waiting for this – an original, evocative song to perfectly frame the moment. Every layer of this intoxicating track blast in combat, but they revert nicely to a toned down version in exploration and build up additional elements the further you get in the stage; it’s a prime example of how Hi-Fi Rush wields its music, and the most memorable one at that. I swear Hi-Fi Rush could be a premier cartoon series. It’s got best-in-class animation, endearing heroes to cheer for, and villains you love to hate, all wrapped in good-natured humor. But on top of that everlasting charm, it turns a dynamic rock soundtrack into its greatest weapon, putting meticulous detail into syncing the beat to all aspects of the experience. It gives combat a uniquely satisfying momentum that other stylish-action games don’t offer, even when the platforming and targeting system drop a couple notes along the way. Hi-Fi Rush is a memorable journey that marches to the beat of its own drum and without a doubt stands among the action greats. "
82,SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake ,5.0,"Whether I’m enjoying my favorite memes or going back to rewatch one of the only cartoons I still legitimately laugh at as an adult, it’s hard to understate SpongeBob SquarePants’ influence on my life. Through it all, the porous goofball I’ve known for years feels like the perfect mascot for an over-the-top, cartoonish platformer. While 2003’s SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom proved it could be done, we’ve been in dire need of a modern take on that idea starring everyone’s favorite fry cook. And yet, like a collapsing Squidward Souffle, SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake dried up my optimism the more I played: it’s merely a thin, by-the-numbers sequel to the 20-year-old Bikini Bottom rather than the ground-up redesign that absorbs the progress genre heroes like Mario or Ratchet and Clank have made in the decades since that we deserve. So although Cosmic Shake does benefit from the quirky SpongeBob characters and their world, as a platformer it’s a terribly bland journey that feels painfully frozen in time even as the fans of the show have continued to age (also painfully). As I’ve come to expect from this delightful sponge, the story begins when he makes a series of extremely ill-advised decisions which cause the very fabric of Bikini Bottom to be torn apart at the seams. Determined to put things right, SpongeBob and a newly transformed balloon version of Patrick begin hopping through portals and fighting samey jelly monsters in search of their friends. What little plot follows is basically just a thinly veiled excuse to revisit memorable SpongeBob episodes, whether you’re running around the prehistoric version of Bikini Bottom or the creepy depths of Rock Bottom, which is a nice trip down memory lane but not exactly an original or memorable SpongeBob tale that can stand on its own.  SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated makes an argument that, if you’re going to remake something beloved, it’s not worth taking any half-measures. Rehydrated’s revisit of the iconic SpongeBob platformer often does just that. Rather than addressing any of the real issues with Battle for Bikini Bottom that could have been tweaked without ruining the spirit of the original, it leaves history intact at the cost of making this a better game – and its problems have only become more noticeable with age and increased competition. There are bright spots that remain fun almost two decades later, and there are pops of ingenuity in its reworking, but it does little to stand alongside the best, or even the pretty good, platformer remakes and remasters we’ve seen this generation. That nostalgic indulgence is helped greatly by the appearance of so many recognizable characters – voiced by their original voice actors – including SpongeBob, Patrick, Pearl, The Flying Dutchman, and Mr. Krabs, most of whom have more than a few amusing lines or gags that they’re a part of. I got a chuckle out of seeing Mr. Krabs as a western bandito or Pearl as a medieval fantasy princess, and the resulting hijinks felt very much like it was straight out of a long-lost episode of the show. Similarly, all the realms you visit along the way are such colorful and vibrantly cartoonish reimaginings of the world of SpongeBob and friends. It’s even got an amazing loading screen where that classic French voice says “one hour later,” and those way-too-detailed closeup images of characters that gross you out, both of which are fantastic nods to the show. That’s what makes it a massive bummer that Cosmic Shake falls so woefully short when it comes to actual gameplay. It’s been almost 20 years since the release of SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom – and just over two since the “Rehydrated” remaster reminded us of how poorly that game’s mechanics have aged – and it’s shocking how little that formula has evolved for this followup. In one of the dullest platformers in recent memory, Cosmic Shake serves up a recipe that’s almost identical to that of its predecessor and had me nodding off as I played. Dreadfully simplistic jumping puzzles and combat against the same handful of enemies who posed absolutely no challenge wore thin quickly. Sure, you can double-jump, ground pound, glide across gaps using a pizza box, attack with your bubble wand, and sometimes activate context-sensitive prompts to do special things like karate kick enemies or swing on a fishing line, but that toolbox is extremely light and never puts you into situations – mandatory or optional – that require a mastery over any of these skills. After the first few hours of its 10-hour campaign, I’d seen just about all the tricks up Cosmic Shake’s sleeves and had to press on through humdrum platforming and combat ad nauseum. Every level has you jump through some metaphorical and literal hoops, broken up by waves of enemies that can easily be swatted away in seconds before going back to platforming. Variety, both in combat and in the “puzzles” that the platforming offers, is a major pain point, and even as you’re traveling through a pirate-themed realm or a Hollywood movie set, you’re fighting the same pushover purple enemies or hopping on the same floating rectangles. Even when you do get a special sequence, like a chase scene atop a seahorse or an extremely brief stealth section, it’s either incredibly short-lived or hardly different enough from the rest of the grind to keep things interesting. The only unique moments are at the end of each level when you fight a boss, like an evil Sandy the Squirrel in a Bruce Lee outfit, though even these highlights aren’t breaking any new ground in terms of gameplay – they just feel loads better than the rest of the boring trek. It’s not that the controls or ideas in Cosmic Shake are poorly implemented, but that they haven’t learned a thing from practically any modern-day platformers that are far more interesting. For example, you don’t get any of the highly entertaining gymnastic platforming feats or unique and silly combat options you’d find in Psychonauts 2 – a game that feels like a lot of its bones would have suited a SpongeBob platformer perfectly. Instead, it plays like every forgettable, middling platformer I’ve played in the past 20 years, and that stunning lack of creativity in an underwater world that’s known for its hilarious originality is a throbbing disappointment for the entirety. As a result, playing Cosmic Shake made me feel like I had put on a high-quality foam SpongeBob costume to attend a costume party, but was forced to perform excruciatingly dull chores while wearing it instead of goofing around; it’s amusing only in the charming disguise that accompanies the otherwise tedious experience. I understand that Cosmic Shake was almost certainly designed with children in mind and I’m sure a kid who hasn’t played a lot of better games would enjoy it just fine, but even so, I can’t imagine any of the children I know enjoying this as much as they would Super Mario Odyssey, which does practically everything better. There are just so many great kid-friendly platformers out there already in 2023, and aside from having SpongeBob's face in it, Cosmic Shake gives you no reasons to play this one over the multitude of alternatives. I mean, you can only blissfully swat around the same three types of enemies or double-jump across identical gaps so many times before you’re sick of it, regardless of your age. Aside from getting through the main story, Cosmic Shake does offer some optional collectathons to complete and even some side quests to go on. Most aren’t worth the trouble, like one side quest that has you cook Krabby Patties for hungry fish in a short minigame. That said, there’s plenty of new content hiding in areas that can be revisited once you’ve gained new abilities, some of which hide interesting secrets and areas that can only be accessed later. Usually, though, they just lead to more of the same dull combat and rote platforming you’ll already be bored with. It has been corrected. SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake is a simple, unambitious platformer that pales in comparison to its peers in every way besides all the charm and humor it borrows from the iconic show. Whether it’s the incredibly basic jumping and swinging that becomes irksomely repetitive within minutes, or the humdrum combat that has you mopping up the same handful of enemies hundreds of times without anything to meaningfully differentiate the first battle from the last, Cosmic Shake badly lacks the imagination and creativity for which the show is known. The original cast’s voice performances and silly gags are certainly a highlight, but if you were hoping for something akin to Super Mario Odyssey in a pineapple under the sea, sadly this falls far short. "
83,Dead Space ,9.0,"Never mind the numerous necromorphs, the tortured torsos sprouting out of walls, or the terrifyingly towering space sphincter – the thing I was most scared of going into the Dead Space remake is that it wouldn't live up to my fond memories of the fantastically horrific 2008 original. After just over 12 hours spent stalking through the revitalized USG Ishimura I’m happy to report that of the many things to legitimately fear about this haunted space hulk, that was not one of them. This new Dead Space enhances the original in almost every way, using a Plasma Cutter to drop its ugliest appendages on the cutting room floor while preserving the essence of what made its distinctly dismemberment-heavy shooting so special, and grafting on welcome new character details in order to present its creepy sci-fi horror story in its very best light – and its most intimidating shadows. If you missed it the first time around, Dead Space takes the action-oriented brand of survival horror established by Resident Evil 4, evolves the combat with a combination of gunplay and the ability to throw objects with Kinesis and temporarily slow enemies down with a Stasis power, and forces you to unlearn everything you know about killing zombies – its hordes of agitated mutants must be blasted limb from limb as opposed to being instantly dropped with a headshot. It sets its strategic brand of slaughter onboard a doomed spaceship that seems straight out of Event Horizon, and focuses on the determined plight of engineer Isaac Clarke and his increasingly disturbing search for his scientist wife Nicole. Although it spawned sequels, comic books, and even a spiritual successor in the form of 2022’s The Callisto Protocol, in my mind nothing has come close to exceeding Isaac’s first heavy footsteps onto the deck of the Ishimura – at least until now.  Developer Motive Studio has made some major renovations to Dead Space’s house of horrors, and boy do I love what they've done with the place. For one, it looks amazing: the supreme level of detail on Isaac’s instantly recognizable engineering suit alone makes that of the original look like a cheap fabric onesie picked up from the bottom shelf in a costume shop. Our ominous spaceship surroundings are made to feel substantially more spine-chilling thanks to realistically weathered steel surfaces and walls overrun with putridly pubescent levels of pus-filled pimples, and impressively moody lighting highlights the enhanced environmental detail while keeping plenty of corners cloaked in shadow – and us in the dark in terms of what might be lurking in them. Not only does the Ishimura look more striking than ever before, it’s also been restructured to encourage more exploration. Although Isaac’s initial arrival in the hangar and flight deck very closely mirrors the layout of the original, it’s not long until you start to notice some substantial differences. For starters, you can now shuttle freely back and forth between the tram stations connecting all the different sections of the Ishimura (once you’ve unlocked them), and you can also travel between certain areas on foot via new corridors like those that connect the flight deck to the medical deck, or indeed off your feet in other sections. A spectacular new zero-gravity detour that takes you from the hangar bay to engineering is just one area that takes advantage of far more liberating flight controls that allow you to manually steer Isaac through space, as opposed to beaming him in rigid straight lines from surface to surface. The benefit of this more interconnected Ishimura is twofold, since not only does it engender a far greater sense of place than the more compartmentalised original, but it also allows for backtracking to access previously locked doors as Isaac’s security level increases over the course of the journey, giving you the opportunity to discover weapon upgrade schematics and various other treasures and making progression feel a bit like a more murder-heavy Metroid. Additionally, the storage rooms in the original game that could only be accessed by spending a precious power node are thankfully no more; instead, gaining access to them requires a bit of enjoyable environmental puzzle solving, like finding the right angle through a shattered window in order to disable a door’s locking mechanism with a pinpoint shot. An equal level of accuracy is demanded by Dead Space’s combat, too, which remains focussed on literally disarming (and/or dislegging) each snarling flesh golem rather than wasting ammo on their vestigial, brainless heads or spongey torsos. Enemy types resemble the same gaggle of ghouls that seem to have been plucked right off John Carpenter’s Pinterest board, but there have been a few welcome tweaks made to the variety of threats you have to encounter. The acid-vomiting variations of the basic spike-handed Slasher seem to be far more common than they were in the original, and they kept me on my toes even after I’d sheared off their legs from a seemingly safe distance – thankfully Isaac is considerably more nimble than he used to be. Meanwhile the hyper-mobile Twitcher types seem far more frenetic than before, and really put my aiming ability and Stasis reserves to the test. Beyond that, enemies are literally dripping with detailed slime and entrails, but that isn’t just disgusting eye candy. Each necromorph now has several layers of flesh and bone to blast away, not only ratcheting up the gore but also giving you a clear visual indication of how close you are to lopping off a limb, which is extremely handy when you’re trying to prioritise a roomful of twisted targets. Dead Space also finds creative new ways to keep tension levels high, often via the cunning use of the new circuit breakers that force you to divert power between certain interactive elements of the environment, like elevators and gravity control systems, in order to complete a mission objective. At one junction box early on I opted to channel power to a maintenance storage room door… But in doing so I had to sacrifice the lighting system, meaning my journey back out of the area was illuminated solely by the narrow beam of torchlight on Isaac’s Plasma Cutter, making for a considerably more panic-inducing trip as each necromorph flashed into my restricted field of view. Conversely, we’re given a few more objects in our surroundings in order to even the often overwhelming odds, and in addition to explosive canisters and spikes to hurl with extremely satisfying kinesis powers, there are also Stasis canisters that can detonate with wide areas of effect – plunging a group of enemies into temporary slow-motion and giving you a precious moment to decide whether to stay and shoot their legs off or use your own legs to bolt for the nearest exit. (These canisters were previously introduced in Dead Space 2.) Call it science fiction survival horror, but Dead Space does the genre proud with an engaging story; action that's tense, fast-paced and extremely violent; as well as atmospheric qualities that will get under your skin and make you jump. It may be a newcomer, but the seeds of an incredible franchise have been sown, and EA's in a great position to reap a phenomenal franchise full of scares. If you like survival horror, action or sci-fi, Dead Space needs to be on your radar. – Jeff Haynes, October 28, 2008Read the full Dead Space (2008) review Throughout the tension-filled adventure, Motive Studio has kept Dead Space’s best moments largely intact while dramatically overhauling and paring back its weaker scenes. The first fight against a regenerating hunter that takes place in a cryogenic chamber plays out in the same intense, close-quarters style as it did previously, because that brilliantly pulse-raising encounter is just as effective now as it was 15 years ago. By contrast, the much-maligned asteroid-blasting sequence in the story’s first half has been completely discarded and dramatically redone: instead of being stuck in a gunner’s seat struggling to fend off an asteroid shower with a pair of rapidly overheating cannons, we must now head out into space and calibrate the Ishimura’s defense system by boosting between each cannon and manually calling each strike while hulking chunks of space rock spin past our noses towards the ship’s hull. It takes a sequence that was previously an aggravating chore and transforms it into an utterly exhilarating challenge, and it’s just one of a number of examples that greatly refine some of the original game’s rougher edges. There are countless other comparatively minor but equally as welcome upgrades, too – like the way triggering an objective marker actually angles the camera towards a waypoint rather than unhelpfully towards your feet, or how you can buy multiples of any given item in the store at once instead of being forced into a series of individual transactions, or how you can now manipulate doors and control panels while holding up an object with kinesis – the latter of which gave me the option of carrying an explosive canister between rooms in anticipation of an ambush. I particularly like the way that weapons are now found in the world – typically during a story event – rather than simply being bought from the store for large sums of credits. It’s smart to introduce a ‘no money down’ test drive of Dead Space’s seven weapon types particularly for newcomers to the series, even though I admittedly settled on the same powered-up Plasma Cutter, Line Gun, and Force Gun combo that I employed in my multiple playthroughs of the original game. Upgrading those weapons this time around offers far more regular rewards. While the layout for each weapon upgrade tree remains similar in terms of interface, all of the pointless empty slots have been removed, meaning there’s a tangible benefit for each and every power node you choose to invest, whether it’s a boost to clip capacity, reload speed, rate of fire, or damage. Additionally, there are special functions to unlock as you reach the ends of each upgrade path, such as incendiary rounds for the plasma cutter or an increase to the size of the Force Gun’s gravity-swirling alternate-fire mode, which bring much-needed buffs to your combat capabilities against the relentless necromorph waves in Dead Space’s dying hours. By the time I’d reached the formidable final boss I’d augmented my favourite suite of repurposed mining tools with enough extra power to bring a tear to the eye of Tim ‘The Toolman’ Taylor. The monsters in Dead Space aren’t the only things with more meat on their bones, and indeed Isaac’s story has been fleshed out with satisfying new helpings of extra detail. There’s an entirely new multi-part side mission devoted to following a breadcrumb trail of holographic logs that reveal Nicole’s most recent movements before the necromorph outbreak, along with other audio and text files that better explain the strained status of the couple’s relationship and the role that the mysterious church of Unitology played in Isaac’s upbringing. As a result, I found that I was able to achieve a far deeper understanding of Isaac’s wavering mental and emotional state this time around, and although the overall story arc is broadly the same as the original, this added context (along with some clever character tweaks) meant that its shocking final twist felt considerably more plausible. Dead Space’s main man is humanised even further in the remake by his ability to talk, rather than merely accept his crewmates’ orders without so much as a silent nod of acknowledgement like he did in the original. Actor Gunner Wright, who voiced Isaac in the Dead Space sequels, delivers a suitably stoic performance, and it makes Isaac feel like a far more influential figure when he’s actively debating plans of attack with chief security officer Hammond, as opposed to just tackling each task like a deep space dogsbody. Thankfully, this is done sparingly: Isaac only speaks when spoken to, and doesn’t deliver Nathan Drake-style quips while he’s pruning limbs off space zombies like they’re the bloodiest kind of Bonsai tree. Instead, his moment-to-moment status is indicated by his heavy breathing and his hurried heartbeat heard in moments of eerie silence, exactly as it should be. With its stunningly redesigned spaceship, smartly and subtly enhanced story, and spectacularly reimagined action scenes, Motive Studio has managed to successfully breathe new life into the seminal sci-fi horror universe of Dead Space. Despite the fact I’ve returned to the 2008 original several times over the years and found it to hold up fairly well, my latest journey through the darkened hallways of the USG Ishimura still managed to consistently surprise me and pull me into Isaac’s plight far more than ever before, while still satisfying my desire to butcher undead astronauts with an enjoyable arsenal of wildly unsafe mining tools. It’s clear that this superb Dead Space remake has been a labour of love for the team at Motive Studios, who’ve very carefully balanced innovation and renovation with preservation, and to their credit the end result is undoubtedly the definitive way to experience – or re-experience – one of the best survival horror shooters that Capcom never made.

84,Forspoken ,6.0,"Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: a down-on-their-luck orphan has their life turned upside-down when they get whisked away to a fantastical new world where they suddenly have magical powers, reluctantly rising to become the hero its people need to stop an evil threat. If that sounds like every fantasy book you’ve ever forgotten you read, it’s probably because Forspoken is a remarkably generic RPG – from its bland story to its lifeless open world. Thankfully its energetic combat and flashy parkour movement system do keep the relatively slim campaign decently entertaining throughout, but running through its boilerplate checklist of repetitive side tasks doesn’t hold much appeal beyond mindless trophy hunting after that. The newest action-RPG from Square Enix puts you in the brooding shoes of Frey Holland, a well-acted but largely unlikable New Yorker who gets pulled through a portal to the fantasy realm of Athia after accidentally becoming bonded to an equally unlikable talking armband she calls Cuff. The four realms of Athia have been afflicted with a corruption that has forced its populace into the last remaining city of Cipal, and it falls on Frey and her newly imbued powers to help its citizens and face four powerful rulers called Tantas – not that she’s very interested in doing so.   Forspoken’s world and story are about as bland as they come, equal parts predictable and forgettable. That’s not so offensive on its own, but the real crime is how poorly the writing establishes any of its characters and the relationships between them – it’s like it constantly assumed I must already be invested in these people in a way it never actually made me. The most egregious example of this is the chemistry between Frey and Cuff, which frames most of the campaign as a sort of buddy cop movie but spends almost no time showing these two unlikely partners grow closer after their introduction. Actual bonding apparently happens off-screen, and this story – which is mostly told through exposition dumps between large stretches of open-world exploration – felt fairly rushed across the 15 hours it took me to beat the campaign as a result. That means the snippy banter between Cuff and Frey come off as obnoxious rather than endearing. Frey is surprisingly vocal about her disdain for most of the tasks Forspoken asks you to complete, and Cuff constantly belittles her for no good reason in a manner that I think is supposed to come off as friendly ribbing but instead feels like awkwardly watching a couple argue at a dinner party. This dynamic never really changes, even as Frey slowly goes through the motions of her predictable hero’s journey, and it is always exhausting. Forspoken is essentially split into two parts: talking to townsfolk and doing mundane side quests like feeding sheep or chasing cats in Cipal, and making your way to some specific point of interest on its absurdly large map to further the story. I don’t think the Cipal sections would have bothered me if conversations and cutscenes didn’t have such a stilted, strangely low-budget feel to them. The performances throughout can actually be quite good, even when the writing leans heavily into telling rather than showing – but none of it is ever very fun to listen to thanks to long, awkward pauses between lines and occasional crowd noise or background music that’s so loud it drowns out everything being said. Between visits to Cipal, you’re generally given a target on your map and free rein to get as distracted as you’d like along the way. That involves sprinting across Athia’s rocky terrain using Frey’s magic parkour skills, flipping over obstacles and eventually using a grappling whip to swing long distances, and then beating the snot out of enemies at various points of interest for new equipment and other rewards. This is what you’ll be doing for the vast majority of your time with Forspoken, and it can be a lot of fun even if those systems never get too deep. Frey gains four styles of elemental magic over the course of the campaign, each essentially a different weapon you can quickly swap between with its own set of alternate fire modes and unlockable support skills – all of which can then be modestly upgraded as you play. Her starting magic is basically an earth-based gun that can be fired rapidly or charged for an area-of-effect burst, with skills that root enemies to the ground, up your defense temporarily, and more. You don’t even have a melee attack until you unlock the fire-based sword option about a third of the way through the campaign, which was a little annoyingly restrictive at first. But once you do open up more of Frey’s capabilities, Forspoken’s particle effect-filled combat becomes quite amusing. Enemy variety isn’t exactly impressive (special larger baddies in particular can be really cool the first time you fight them, but less so by the third), but elemental resistances and unique quirks pushed me to swap weapons and strategies frequently mid-fight in a way I really enjoyed. For example, I loved that shielded enemies could be dealt with either by getting behind them or by charging an AOE shot and then firing it at the ground nearby to knock them off their guard. One-on-one fights can devolve into locking onto your target and holding down the trigger while you strafe out of harm’s way with Forspoken’s extremely generous dodge system, but the group encounters often did a good job of keeping me on my toes. Similarly, the parkour system is a mix of straightforward and flashy, sending you nimbly soaring across the environment by simply holding down the Circle button and pointing yourself in a given direction. Just like your attacks, this becomes a lot more fun once you unlock some cooler skills, like options that boost your speed with well-timed button presses. That said, it is also far more mindless than combat, requiring very little nuance even as additional techniques become available to you and rarely ever testing your mastery of those moves with difficult platforming challenges. Even still, it can be quite a satisfying way to fancifully flow from task to task without much thought. That’s a good thing, too, because there is a considerable amount of ground to cover in Athia, and very little of it is worth stopping to admire. This world is huge, and the campaign doesn’t even send you near half of it. The map is littered with optional side objective markers, but there isn’t much reason to go too far off the beaten path to complete them when the same small handful of tasks are repeated ad nauseam no matter where they are placed. They almost all boil down to either fighting some random dudes to earn a reward or just being handed one outright, and the payoffs don’t feel particularly necessary unless you decide to up the difficulty to Hard. Plenty of open-world games follow a similar structure, but Forspoken does it with such a barebones transparency that Athia comes off less like a world for you to explore and more like a repetitive checklist asking to be crossed off. It doesn’t help that Athia lacks much in the way of interesting visual landmarks, with different areas gated off by blatantly artificial mountain ranges and filled with piles of samey rocks and ruins to hop over. Each of the four regions offer a little twist to their layout, be that wide open fields or extra hills, but they’d still all blend together if it weren’t for the distinct color filter slapped onto each one. After the credits rolled I ran around this map for another dozen or so hours, hoping to find some exciting secrets in the hard-to-reach corners I hadn’t visited – but with the exception of an isolated trader selling a few neat items (literally the only NPC I met outside of Cipal), all I saw was the same side tasks on the same bland landscapes, over and over and over again. I’m sure there will be diehard completionists out there excited for a chance to put on a podcast and spend dozens of hours clearing every single map marker and opening every single chest (the kind of game I actually wrote about back in 2019), but I was given very little motivation to do so here. The upside of that lack of urgency is that Forspoken’s progression systems mercifully don’t devolve into a grind on its Normal difficulty either, never forcing you to do anything you don’t want to. There are only three types of equipable items: cloaks, necklaces, and the charmingly creative nail polish designs. The first two are basically identical, increasing your health, defense, and magic while also offering special perks like increasing critical hit chance, while nails provide more unique boons like upping a specific type of magic. A light crafting system lets you upgrade your cloaks and necklaces by using resources you collect out in the field, increasing their stats and letting you swap in the perks of any gear you’ve found so far. That lends a lot of welcome flexibility to how you choose to play (and your fashion choices), but it’s also not the most exciting system since the majority of improvements are simple numerical boosts that are hard to see the effect of in the heat of battle.  While I encountered little to no notable bugs or technical issues while playing Forspoken on PlayStation 5 in Performance Mode, it is worth noting that we have not had a chance to try the PC version before the publication of this review. That doesn't necesarilly mean something is wrong with it (code can be sent out late for a variety of reasons), but that delay combined with the hefty system requirements that were revealed last week do give me a little bit of pause. We won't know for sure how it performs on PC until we've had a chance to try it ourselves, and we will post a full performance review once we do, but it's at least worth a word of caution until then.  Forspoken is the sort of game you’ve probably seen before – from its stereotypical fish-out-of-water fantasy story to its giant open-world map full of repetitive optional tasks. Its combat is flashy and fun enough to entertain across its comparatively short RPG campaign, with fights that do a good job of pushing you to shake up your use of elemental powers even when the overall variety of enemies isn’t particularly impressive. Its parkour system is also satisfying enough, despite the scenery you are running through being about as picturesque as a bowl of rocks with an Instagram filter slapped on. There’s a kind of person that might be enough for, happy to spend hours and hours uncovering every inch of Forspoken’s needlessly large map after the main story, but that doesn’t mean I was able to find much reason to do so once the credits had rolled. "
85,That '90s Show: Season 1 ,7.0,"That '90s Show is now streaming on Netflix. In the age of reboots, revivals, and sequels of beloved classic shows, That ‘70s Show – which aired from 1998 to 2006 – has been given another revival and, unlike the failed attempt with That ‘80s Show, That ‘90s Show succeeds by continuing the story of the Foreman family in Point Place, Wisconsin, even if it does rely a little too heavily on its predecessor at times.  Set 15 years after the end of That ‘70s Show, That ‘90s Show finds Eric Foreman (Topher Grace) and Donna Pinciotti (Laura Prepon) living happily married in Chicago and parents to a young, awkward teenager named Leia (Callie Haverda). They visit Eric's parents – Kitty (Debra Jo Rupp) and Red (Kurtwood Smith) – in Point Place, Wisconsin for the Fourth of July before Eric and Leia go on their father-daughter space camp retreat. But after she bonds with the “riot grrrl”-next-door Gwen (Ashley Aufderheide) and her friends, Leia requests to spend the rest of the summer with her grandparents. Her new basement friends consist of grunge music lover Gwen; Gwen’s himbo half-brother Nate (Maxwell Acee Donovan); his controlling, witty girlfriend Nikki (Sam Morelos); the sarcastic realist Ozzie (Reyn Doi); and the attractive goofball Jay Kelso (Mace Coronel) – yes, the son of Michael (Ashton Kutcher) and Jackie Kelso (Mila Kunis). That ‘90s Show sticks to the same format and mood as the original series. The kids spend their summer doing random hijinks, from attending a rave to picking up free stuff from the Pennysaver to their hilarious, deep discussions while high. Leia is endearing as the wallflower – basically the girl version of her father as a teen. Nate and Nikki, like Michael Kelso and Jackie, are the shallow, incompatible couple. Ozzie is the queer Asian kid living in Wisconsin who is comparable to Fez (Wilmer Valderrama), who was also seen as an outsider. Gwen is very much the rebel like Eric’s best friend Steven Hyde (Danny Masterson). And Jay is a dopey version of Donna, the love interest. If the formula worked before, it should work again, right? To some extent, sure. The characters individually are comical – especially Ozzie, whose sardonic one-liners were amusing – but as a group, they lack the chemistry to believe in their relationship drama. Even the season finale, which ended on an emotional cliffhanger, felt flat and unearned. The show plays into the ‘90s well with its music and the subtle call outs to Glamour Shots, snap bands, Blockbuster, and even the movie Clerks – leading to a hilarious moment when Leia, who had never seen Clerks, makes up that it’s her favorite movie and that Kevin Smith “was so sexy in that.” It’s also fun to see Red and Kitty adapt to the ever-changing society by being introduced to the internet. Kitty, at one point, believes that the government can hear everything through the computer. She whispers to it, “I loved you on Arsenio, Bill” – referencing the president of that time, Bill Clinton, on the ‘90s talk show The Arsenio Hall Show. The series truly works because of its connective tissue to the original with Kitty, Red, Fez, and the many cameos that show up. Fans of That ‘70s Show can expect many inside gags and Easter eggs, with the pilot episode especially completely stuffed with references. It’ll definitely be a treat for those wondering what happened to the beloved characters minus Hyde (due to Masterson’s legal troubles). Rupp, Smith, and Valderrama fall back into their roles as if no time had passed, with Valderrama stealing every scene he’s in. Though it is delightful seeing familiar and some unexpected returning characters in the series, newcomers may not understand the inside jokes or the comedy. For example, the many cameos from Leo (‘70s icon Tommy Chong) made sense in That ‘70s Show, but some viewers today won’t understand his role in this series as being anything other than a stoned hippie. That ‘90s Show is at its best when the gags relate to the original series, especially with the high circle and dealing with Red and Kitty. But that is putting too much weight on the older cast members when the show should focus on the kids of the present day – or in this case, the kids of the ‘90s. That is not to say that, if given a second season, they can’t improve on that aspect. The teen characters have the potential to be even better than their predecessors, but nepotism can only get you so far. Netflix’s That ‘90s Show is a blast from the past of the ‘90s and of memories from That ‘70s Show. With funny moments filled with nostalgia, That ‘90s Show is charming and has a lot of potential. The series follows the same format as the original, which works for the characters and their storylines, but relies too heavily on the original cast – leaving little room for the new wave of talented teens to fully develop their relationships with each other. "
86,High on Life ,8.0,"They say that tragedy + time = comedy, but in gaming the real tragedy is the amount of time we have to wait between quality comedy games. Thankfully, in the opening moments of High on Life, as my talking gun belittlingly whispered to me that I was doing a great job as I shot dancing aliens in the face, I got the feeling I’d struck gold. While it has bugs and performance hitches and occasionally frolics in unimpressive toilet humor, it largely succeeds at being the type of absurd space satire I’ve always wanted. Whether I was chatting with my shotgun about the merits of science and formulas, covering myself in alien poop to sneak into a secure facility, or inexplicably watching a full live-action movie from the ‘90s on nearby television, High on Life is a game that just knows how to have a good time, and there really aren’t enough of those. This delightfully inappropriate first-person shooter puts its comedic premise and characters front and center and absolutely refuses to take itself seriously. After Earth is taken over by disgusting aliens who kidnap humans to be smoked as hallucinogenic drugs, you begin a ridiculous space odyssey to get revenge against the extraterrestrial drug cartel responsible. All the while, you’re accompanied by the stars of the show: the extremely rude weapons themselves, who serve not only as your tools of destruction, but as the story’s most important characters. These animate weapons (called Gatlians) are easily the best part of the adventure, and include Kenny, the easily flustered pistol that’s basically Justin Roiland doing his usual Rick &amp; Morty thing, Sweezy, the foul-mouthed sniper rifle that seems to be a reference to Halo’s Needler, Creature, who shoots uses his rapidly gestating children as ammo, and my personal favorite: Gus, the surprisingly wholesome shotgun voiced by Curb Your Enthusiasm’s JB Smoove. While some took a while to earn my love, spending an entire 16-hour journey with these guys held up right to my face ended up being a fantastic excuse for lots of amusing dialogue and character development. By the time the credits rolled, I really didn’t want to have to put my new best friends back in their holsters.  That’s due in large part to High on Life’s mostly solid writing, which piles on dumb gags, curse-laden rants, and lots of TV screens airing idiotic shows that look like they could have been pulled straight from one of Rick &amp; Morty’s Interdimensional Cable episodes. One level features an intentionally irritating alien who follows you around and rambles on, seemingly without end, until you finally unlock the ability to murder him dead. Another makes you go to Space Applebee’s and have a full meal for no apparent reason. You can also find a movie theater playing the real-world movie from 1990, Demon Wind, complete with Mystery Science Theater 3000-like commentary via some nearby aliens, which you’d better believe I watched in its entirety. The campaign is only about eight hours long if you have the willpower and focus to ignore all of these delightful distractions and power through, so naturally my first playthrough took me over 16 hours, specifically because I was goofing off for so much of it. The entire thing is just packed with so much silliness and it’s always exciting to spend time planet-hopping through it; I never knew when I might run into something insane, like when I teleported a stretch of freeway onto a jungle planet and watched the occupants of the cars who’d been taken with it slowly devolve from a group of aliens with road rage into an insane cult that sacrificed their own to appease the asphalt gods. A lot of the jokes in High on Life are either lowbrow or sophomoric, or pearl-clutchingly irreverent, and like pretty much all comedy it won’t work for everyone. But as a fan of classic comedy games like Borderlands 2 and South Park: The Stick of Truth, it definitely worked for me. There were moments where all the cursing and shock humor felt lazy or a bit much – and that’s coming from someone with an extremely high tolerance for it – but more often than not the silly bits and crass dialogue land. It’s just hard not to chuckle when the grunt enemies stop in the middle of combat to disrespectfully twerk in your direction, y’know? It’s impressive, though, that in a shooter so ridiculous and purposefully flippant with its setting, High on Life’s story ends up having a lot of heart. I genuinely enjoyed bonding with the washed-up bounty hunter turned mooch couch-crasher, Gene, and I felt real motivation to destroy the alien drug cartel – though mostly to get payback for my Gatlian buddies, not to save the human race. In perfect harmony with High on Life’s completely chaotic vibe, slinging your companion guns in firefights is over-the-top and occasionally a bit messy. Weapons are somewhat inaccurate and enemies flop around the battlefield shooting gloop at you, and in the opening hours I worried there would be little more to combat than using pea shooter Kenny to mop up brainless ants. It doesn’t help that, even on the hardest difficulty, High on Life is almost always incredibly easy to get through – you’re given ample opportunity to restore your health and shield, and incoming bullets are almost always slow enough to be easily avoided. Luckily, once you gain some new tools like the jetpack or other interesting combat options (like Creature’s power to mind-control enemies on the battlefield or Gus’ ability to suck up smaller bad guys right in front of him and then blast them to bits) things get a lot more interesting. There’s still plenty to shake a fist at though, like how weak the enemy variety is, or how hostile aliens occasionally get stuck inside the environment, or the incredibly perplexing decision to make the down button on the d-pad the default button for crouch button  (you can rebind this in the Ease of Access section of your Xbox settings menu). These things certainly don’t make for the smoothest combat experience, and the fun comes from finding creative ways to clear each area of baddies. Like how you can use Kenny’s glob shot ability to toss enemies in the air then juggle them with bullets until they explode, or how you can kill enemies that are behind cover (or stuck in the environment) by using Sweezy’s object-piercing shots. It’s definitely more chaotic and less finely tuned than your ideal shooter, but it’s a pretty good sandbox for pulling off stupid and amusing kills, and that sorta jives well with High on Life’s energy. When your guns aren’t shooting at things, they make trusty allies for getting through each level using their alternate-fire modes – horrifyingly named their “trick hole” – which gives them functionality beyond killing things. Kenny can knock obstacles out of the way with his Glob Shot, Gus can create platforms by shooting his spinning blades into walls, Sweezy can shoot bubbles that slow time in a given area, and more. I was pleasantly surprised at how fun it was to just run around searching for collectibles and hidden loot boxes. In Metroidvania fashion, as you unlock weapons and abilities you’ll gain access to new areas and secrets in locations you’ve already visited, which makes backtracking a worthwhile use of time. Collecting alien Pesos by exploring is fairly rewarding too, as you can use said space currency to buy upgrades for your weapons and bounty hunting suit, which give useful perks like an upgraded version of Gus’ enemy-sucking ability that lets him tear off their armor and give it to you. High on Life also has some crazy and memorable boss fights which serve as loopy crescendos to each level and have you facing down an alien criminal of one persuasion or another. Not only are these fights the only parts where I felt legitimately challenged during combat, but the bosses you fight and the inane things they have you do are almost always fantastic punchlines to whatever that bad guy’s whole deal was. So much so, in fact, that I actually felt kinda sad about having to viciously slaughter them. In one boss fight, the bad guy punished me in a way that made me have to pause for a bit and allow myself to laugh at the meta humor of it – it’s the kind of dastardly attack I could never have seen coming. When you first start it up, High on Life gives you another bit of meta-humor: a disclaimer warning that ""Any glitches or bugs you may encounter are intentional satirical references to other games with glitches and bugs."" That joke didn’t make me laugh as much as I played, because it really is prone to bugs and performance issues that, while rarely bad enough to put a halt to the good times, were a regular irritation. At the time of this writing, a performance patch has been deployed that appears to have fixed the worst of the issues, but in times of extreme stress like a few of the more elaborate boss fights, I am still seeing some minor framerate dips playing on an Xbox Series X. As for the bugs, they’re usually minor annoyances like the time I had a character lock up on me so I couldn’t advance dialogue with him until I reloaded my save, or when a few enemies continued to stand around as intangible beings after I killed them. High on Life is an irreverent, absurd shooter that manages to shine with its outrageous humor, silly setting and story, and some really goofy, foul-mouthed guns that pull the whole thing together for the vast majority of the time. Combat is a bit sloppy, especially during the first act, and the whole sci-fi adventure sometimes has an unpolished feel to it, but once you get some new tools of destruction and movement options, it rises to the occasion. Not all of its jokes find their punchline, but with memorable boss fights, unique alt-fire abilities and exploration, and way more terrible movies to watch than I expected, this wacky journey is definitely worth your time. "
87,Dragon Quest Treasures ,7.0,"An adorable Kitty Shield smiles up at me from my latest treasure haul. The local appraiser, unmoved by its cute design, may say it’s not worth much, but that just means I get to proudly hang it on display in my vault instead – it’s not the most valuable piece of my hoard, but I look on it with satisfaction nonetheless. That Kitty Shield is a suitable metaphor for Dragon Quest Treasures as a whole: It’s far from the richest jewel in the Dragon Quest crown, but a laid-back structure, charming world, and endless stream of rewards make it a relaxing RPG still worth admiring. Treasures stars Erik, your thieving companion from Dragon Quest XI, and his sister Mia, but it takes place long before the Luminary stepped into their lives, when both pint-sized pickpockets lived with a crew of Viking marauders. After finding a flying pig and a talking cat (like you do), Erik and Mia fall through a magic portal into another dimension, which conveniently means that nothing they do or see has any bearing on Dragon Quest XI’s established story – but that’s just fine for a game full of constant meta references to the series as a whole anyway.  The portal drops Erik and Mia into Draconia, a world where dragons once turned the hopes and memories of people into treasures and tucked them away for safekeeping, with each one taking the form of items and people from Dragon Quest history. The dragons are long dead, but their various body parts now comprise the half-dozen regions that make up Draconia, though I promise that’s in a cool way rather than a gruesome one. For example, Draconia’s wings are home to windswept moorlands, while frigid mountains and icy caves make up its shoulder, aptly named The Cold Shoulder. Your overall goal here is to build a base for your budding gang of treasure hunters using the money you earn from finding loot, all while helping your cat and pig guides restore good favor with their gods. Hoarding treasure is central to all your efforts, but when you and the part of monsters you’ll assemble to help dig up the sparkly prizes, you’re finding more than just a piece of Dragon Quest nostalgia. You’re restoring something – dreams, connections, and purpose – the people of Draconia (and even your rival treasure hunters) thought was lost forever, albeit indirectly. Meanwhile, the regional train director doesn’t care whether you find armor from Dragon Quest V or a statue of Dragon Quest X’s priestess, but they are thrilled when your efforts lead to their beloved train stations getting back on track, making exploring Draconia easier in the process. This alternate reality setup gives Treasures the freedom to try something different with its story, which it only partially manages to capitalize on. This is more of a Dragon Quest fairy tale than it is a Monsters-style spinoff, one of the wholesome, slightly bittersweet variety. Everyone, monster and human alike, is obsessed with finding treasure for no other reason than because it exists – and while that seems like a shallow foundation for any story, the one told here actually tip-toes around some pretty heavy themes. Treasures is a child’s fantasy escape at its heart, a chance for two orphans to leave their abusive home, have fun, and make a life for themselves away from the troubles of growing up and adults unfit to care for them. It feels like Dragon Quest meets J.M. Barrie’s Peter Pan in that sense, which is a surprising but not unwelcome place to draw inspiration. Draconia is the siblings’ Neverland, even down to one of the duo’s primary opponent being a nefarious pirate, albeit of the skeleton variety instead of the hook-handed-old-man kind. Like the Lost Boys of Neverland, time and society forgot the people of Draconia as well, or at least the ones you befriend at the old Trans-Draconic Railway headquarters, where Erik and Mia make their base. It’s heartwarming to watch as you build a surrogate family of misfits and monsters at the railway headquarters, a support group for Erik and Mia and a safe place to return to. For those familiar with Dragon Quest XI’s story, Erik and Mia’s sad, broken future (broken, ironically, by the same obsession with treasure that fuels this adventure) always hangs overhead, adding a tinge of sadness to the otherwise happy setup for dedicated fans. Unfortunately, Treasures never really mines that rich vein of story potential like it could, doing little to build on any of its themes after first presenting them. Erik and Mia have no character development across the roughly 30-hour campaign, and their relationships with most NPCs outside a small handful are limited to interactions that end along with whatever quest they asked you to complete. How much you get out of Treasures’ story and characters depends on how invested you are in the idea of reinvigorating the hearts and minds of this world, since you never witness much of the results of those efforts. It’s hard not to see Treasures as a missed opportunity in that sense, one that with a bit more depth and detail could’ve been something special and more meaningful. In between meeting new people and staring at your treasure hoard, you’ll take Erik or Mia on expeditions to one of Draconia’s islands to see what you can find and convince other monsters to join in the hunt. Once you arrive in these wide open areas, you’re pretty much free to decide what you want to do and when. You could rush to a rival treasure hunter’s base and swipe their hoard, seek out ancient monuments, or persuade a Queen Slime to help restore the Cold Shoulder train station, – or just ignore everything and find more treasure. The main questline is centered on recovering ancient artifacts, but it often takes a backseat to the many extra requests that come your way from friendly monsters and fellow treasure hunters. While it’s easy to get bogged down in the number of objectives – and the horizon does get cluttered with quest markers at times – the benefit of having so many quests is that you’re always accomplishing something, even if those quests are just variations of finding certain resources  A local princess’ emissary could need help finding an ancient monument on the other side of the dragon’s belly. It’s a long trudge to get there, but on the way you can grab some soil to craft more pellet ammo to use in your next battle and pick up a few rare stones to help power the next broken-down train station that needs restoring. Whatever you choose to do, you’re always encouraged to be on the lookout for treasure to help your base grow and unlock new main quests. You have an innate treasure compass that points you in the general direction of rare goods (because of course you do), but it goes haywire when you get too close. That means you have to rely on the treasure vision of your monster companions to track the goods down, with visual clues based on their own line of sight. Slimes only see from ground level, for example, while the vision of a Sham Hatwitch is appropriately obscured by its own hat. It’s a charming, typically Dragon Quest spin on what would otherwise be a repetitive mini-game, and combined with the little ascending jingle that plays when you dig up treasure, it helps keep the routine feeling fun even after dozens of hours. None of the tasks you’re given are ever very complex, but it helps that Treasures and its treasure hunting appeal to the lizard part of my brain that lights up after finding something shiny, solving an easy puzzle, or checking a task off the list. Does it matter if my base’s value increases to substantially, or if I unravel the mysteries of Draconia? No! But I put a cool piece of Dragon Quest history on a plinth back home and made a fictitious, train-loving robot happy once for a few minutes, and that was enough for me. The low-pressure, low-stakes nature of what you’re doing and the constant drip of accomplishment lends Treasures a sense of coziness that makes it easy and enjoyable to pick up, even if you don’t always see world-changing effects from your labors. Treasures passively encourages you to take its quests and treasure hunts in small doses by limiting how much treasure you can carry, which means you have to revisit your base at intervals and take a break from questing. While there’s plenty to do back at headquarters, that intentional speedbump can start to feel a little arbitrarily annoying, like perhaps Square Enix had plans for something bigger that never materialized. You have daily quests similar to what you’d expect from a live-service game, but they play little role in your routine and offer paltry rewards. You can also theoretically build and improve your base, though the improvements extend to just a handful of shops you can only access via the company’s reception desk. Despite drawing inspiration from Dragon Quest Monsters, Treasures is less concerned with you building an unstoppable team of critters and mostly just wants you to explore with them, which is a fitting complement to the emphasis on item gathering. Battles are comparatively simple, too, with the focus firmly on what treasure-finding aptitudes and other skills your companions have. Each monster you take with you has a set of preferred treasures they’re more likely to uncover during expeditions and a species-specific skill called a Forte – abilities such as gliding or sprinting that make travel easier or help you reach difficult places. Each region is fairly simple in structure, with few exciting layouts or well-hidden secrets, and they’re built around using specific abilities to find treasure spots and rare items. Bland as the layouts may seem, the simplicity can be welcome at times as it makes backtracking and avoiding unfriendly monster mobs much more bearable. When you do pick a fight, you play a passive role, helping deal damage with pellets from your slingshot or heal your monster friends. You have no control over their actions and can only issue basic attack and gather commands, but the monster AI is, mercifully, quite adept at figuring out the best way to tackle enemies. Slimes and Drackys work together to set up elemental combos, tankier monsters such as Restless Armor cast their defensive spells at exactly the right moment, and they all actually balance their attack choices to conserve MP. Here, too, there’s the potential for something more involved that makes fuller use of these features – deeper battles with emphasis on building combos and finding the right mix of monsters. And here, too, Treasures prioritizes being light and breezy instead, without much need or reward for giving your team composition that sort of thought and care. There’s actively off-putting about that, especially since these fights are still fun enough as is. It’s just jarring to see what looks like so many discarded plans, and that lack of clear direction is noticeably unusual for a Dragon Quest game. Dragon Quest Treasures is a light, charming take on the classic RPG series. In place of challenging battles and complex campaigns, it offers a cute fairy tale of two orphans finding riches, building a new family, and bringing happiness to a weary land. It’s impossible to ignore the wasted potential for a more nuanced story and more thoughtful combat that could have been, but the relaxed pace and constant stream of rewards still make Treasures a satisfying RPG to plunder your way through. "
88,Need for Speed Unbound ,7.0,"No other racing game released this year looks quite like Need for Speed Unbound, and that can be a difficult thing to achieve in such an established genre so steeped in convention. Criterion has gone all-in with wild, animated visual flair that often appears as though it’s been lifted from the pages of a comic book, even as the actual driving and split day/night structure of its races are immediately familiar to those of us who appreciated 2019’s Need for Speed Heat. The result is a uniquely styled racer that regularly looks quite fabulous in motion, though its grating story mode goes over like a banana in the tailpipe and the online mode simply feels stripped down and unfinished. While Heat hardly revolutionised arcade racing, it was a pleasant surprise that put the teetering franchise back on track. For its efforts, developer Ghost Games was… disbanded, and the series drunk dialled its way back into the arms of former flame Criterion Games for Unbound, and it’s received a striking makeover. You can apply artistic embellishments, including smoke and illustrations, to cars like any other visual customisation part. There are a variety of different ones to choose from, although essentially they all seem fairly similar, with the key differences between them mostly limited to the colour of the smoke and the selection of graphics that get thrust from the sides of your car like wings, or flashed above the roof like a tiny, temporary hat. The effects you choose are globally applied to your whole garage, though, and it seems like an oversight that you can’t select bespoke effects for individual cars.  It’s all very stylish in an Into the Spider-Verse, street art kind of way, and I do admire Criterion’s commitment to trialling something that sets Need for Speed apart from its peers. It’s flashy and eye-catching, and it’s very well executed. It doesn’t look like a superficial layer of effects pasted over the surface of the image; it definitely feels baked into the 3D world. Donuts, for instance, look particularly cool as the special animations hold up well even with a very kinetic camera. However, the juxtaposition between Unbound’s cars (which continue to strive towards photorealism) and its cartoon characters and effects is a peculiar one. It isn’t jarring, especially considering that there have been some big improvements with the lighting since Heat and, at its best, Unbound looks like a highly stylised, interactive trailer. But I can’t shake the feeling that it’s a compromise, accidental or otherwise, that Unbound’s vehicles and world haven’t been given the same treatment – like a modern-day Auto Modellista, or 2020’s Inertial Drift. Would that have been controversial? Probably. Divisive? Certainly. But I think it would’ve looked better than this blended solution. Beneath the snazzy effects, Unbound sticks more closely to Heat’s gameplay format than I’d expected. This isn’t exactly a bad thing – Heat was a very welcome course correction after Payback and I enjoyed it. That said, it does make Unbound feel like an evolution of Ghost’s work rather than something Criterion has really put its own stamp on, like it did with its acclaimed 2010 reboot of Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, and its take on Need for Speed: Most Wanted from 2012. Unbound’s new Chicago-inspired Lakeshore map has some nice, grid-like streets and tunnels for its urban racing, but the city itself is actually a bit vanilla compared to Heat’s neon-bathed, Miami-like Palm City. Unbound’s countryside is also quite typical and unmemorable – which, to be fair, was also a criticism of Heat. It’s just freeways, backroads, and trees draped over some hills. There are a couple of nice mountainside segments with multiple switchbacks for drifting, but overall there’s nothing particularly interesting to look at outside the city. In single-player, Unbound’s cops function similarly to Heat, although I think it’s a little easier to slip out their grasp this time around. Unbound seems a lot better at detecting if I’m accelerating into clear space so, unlike Heat, I’m yet to be arbitrarily busted simply because the cops are nearby my otherwise escaping car. This happened quite a lot in Heat, so I’m glad it appears to have been addressed. The strictly arcade-style driving model is also inherited from Heat, which means cars can be tuned for grip, drift, or a balance between the two. I haven’t been able to figure out whether it’s my driving style or my handling slider set-up, but my attempts at grip tuning seem plagued with understeer. The drift handling is more reliable in my experience, and definitely my preference. The ability to choose between a classic brake-to-drift cornering style or an extra pump of the throttle to get sideways remains, too. Continuing to cater to both camps is very smart. Like Heat, racing is divided into day and night events, but Unbound tweaks the formula slightly. While Heat alternates between sanctioned street racing during the day and illegal events during the evening, all of Unbound’s racing is verboten, 24 hours a day. Cop heat accumulated during the day carries over to the night too, so deciding how much police attention you want to take with you into the evening is an interesting juggling act. Higher-paying races require higher initial heat levels, but they also require higher buy-ins – so it’s actually possible to lose money if you perform poorly, especially since Unbound limits restarts. I’m not entirely sold on the gambling angle in general due to some highly questionable manoeuvres by the AI stacking the deck against me, but having more on the line does increase the tension in a mostly satisfying way. To its credit, progression through Unbound isn’t built around winning every single race we come across, which means it can be consistently challenging without entirely stalling our progress. Building up the necessary cash to both craft a competitive car and afford the hefty buy-ins for the high-risk races can become a bit of a grind though, certainly early on. There are three levels of difficulty, and Unbound can be a stiff test at times regardless of your selection. It does cross the line from tough to cheap on occasion, and there were times where an AI racer would blitz ahead so quickly that no amount of perfect driving and boosting could stop them gapping me. Having opponents able to more-or-less speed match you the millisecond you trigger a nitrous boost is not a problem unique to Unbound – it’s a common gripe in a variety of arcade racers – but it is a snag that tends to leave the boost system feeling flaccid and ineffectual. What’s more annoying, however, are the occasions where I’d blast past a crashed opponent only for them to supernaturally respawn well ahead of me on track. It’s extremely frustrating to lose to a racer who clearly cheated to place ahead of you – especially when I’d wagered extra in-game cash on beating them and I’m out of restarts. Even on the tamest setting, Unbound’s AI racers can be unexpectedly competitive at times. I was definitely a little surprised at how ruthless the so-called ‘Relaxed’ setting is watching my kids struggle to keep up; at least, I was whenever I wasn’t too busy wincing at the dialogue. Heat’s script wasn’t exactly in line to win itself an armful of Primetime Emmys, but it was a pleasing pivot away from the pish that was Payback. Unbound feels like a step down from that. The overall story itself is harmless enough, but its trite cocktail of 2020s teenage angst and Tik Tok philosophising definitely pushed me to my tolerance limit. Personally, I suspect Lakeshore’s mayor is just tired of family minivans being speared off the road by 900-horsepower JDM missiles and innocent commuters being hosed off the hard shoulder, so it’s a little hard to empathise with the cast’s constant whining about their personal freedoms being repressed by traffic laws meant to curb wanton vehicular manslaughter. To be fair, I don’t know that there’s an elegant way for a 28-year-old franchise like Need for Speed to truly speak to the full spectrum of its audience at once, but I should warn you that if you’re a veteran player from the mid-’90s I’d hesitate to suggest you’re going to feel very represented in Unbound. Certainly not by any of these young and slim Instagram influencer avatars, whose fashion aesthetic appears to be music festival drug dealer, football match drug dealer, or off-brand Weird Al Yankovic. The mechanical expression enabled by the deep car customisation that previous developer Ghost began reinjecting into the series in its 2015 Need for Speed reboot has universal appeal, and that’s all very much still here in Unbound, but there’s definitely a generational disconnect in terms of the characters and tone. There is a way to engage with Unbound without this story layer, as the cross-play enabled online multiplayer is a separate mode that does away with it and focuses purely on racing and upgrading your ride. Unfortunately, that’s not all it does away with, and online mode is missing quite a few features at launch – the biggest of which is cops. Equally unfortunately: when I say that online and single-player are ‘separate’, I mean entirely separate. Your single-player garage and progression isn’t shared online, so you need to build a new stable of cars. I have to admit that after 30-odd hours of working my way to the top of the story mode, the prospect of starting from scratch online really took the jam out of my donut. When the rubber hits the road it’s evident Need for Speed Unbound hasn’t strayed very far from the fundamentals of 2019’s Heat. This is a little surprising following the series’ shift back to Criterion – a studio that has traditionally had a very distinct style of its own – although it isn’t a bad thing considering Heat was a welcome splash of gas for a franchise that was close to running on fumes. Unbound should, however, turn heads thanks to its bold new animated characters and special effects. Despite the odd juxtaposition between its traditional graphics and the cartoon-inspired flourishes, they are strikingly well done and make for an instantly recognisable instalment of this 28-year-old series. However, while the car customisation tools are as expressive as ever, it does feel unlikely that older players will be able to connect with the single-player mode’s preening cast of entitled chuckleheads, and unfortunately the separate online mode is currently missing core features like cops. "
89,Crisis Core –Final Fantasy 7– Reunion ,8.0,"Crisis Core –Final Fantasy 7– Reunion is a perfect example of how a game can blur the line between a remaster and a remake, using the skeleton of its already great 2007 PSP original while completely rebuilding the muscle around it. Every change brings it much closer to 2020’s excellent Final Fantasy 7 Remake, from its gorgeously updated graphics to its considerably faster combat. However, Crisis Core stops short of the total upheaval FF7R leaned into, and many design choices made with the original PSP game in mind prevent this remaster from being an entirely unblemished reunion. Just as before, Crisis Core is an action-focused prequel that follows Zack Fair, a plucky and likable foil to his far more moody companion, the iconic Cloud Strife. Starting roughly seven years before the events of Final Fantasy 7, Zack hopes to climb the ranks of Shinra Electric Company’s SOLDIER program with dreams of becoming a Soldier 1st Class – the best of the best, just like Sephiroth. Even today it’s still a great story that neatly ties Zack, Cloud, and Sephiroth’s threads together, with real-time combat that melds some quirky systems in interesting ways – like the strange DMW (Digital Mind Wave) slot machine that brings a bit of the Gold Saucer to every fight.  ""Issues aside, Crisis Core is a great PSP game -- no question. It honors Final Fantasy VII's legacy. Even the game's music, while not composed by Nobuo Uematsu, is charming and fits the overall style of the world (though some of Uematsu's pieces do make a return and to absolutely stunning effect). I was sincerely moved by certain portions of the title and I suspect many others will feel the same. I wouldn't dream of spoiling anything for eager players, but I will say that Crisis Core's ending moments are a must see. I'd go so far as to call them brilliant. The power and emotion of the game is heightened by the raw inevitability of Zack's fate, which is fully explored in the original. I really enjoyed my time with this title, despite the gameplay problems, and I think this is yet another fantastic reason to own a PSP. Enjoy it. The most immediate and noticeable change to Reunion is its graphical overhaul, using Unreal Engine 4 to get its in-game visuals relatively close to parity with FF7R. Character models look great, environments are highly detailed, and even its menus and UI replicate the remake’s clean look that blends form and function so nicely. Though Crisis Core was already one of the better looking PSP games, these visual improvements make it feel far more modern and surprisingly high-budget for what Square Enix is classifying as a remaster. Reunion could easily be mistaken for a brand-new game in most regards, though there are some remnants of the original holding it back from looking as good as it possibly can. For example, the original CG cutscenes are reused here – they benefit from being presented on bigger and higher definition screens, but they are disappointing when compared to the in-game action. Think of them as being somewhere between the visual quality of Advent Children and the cutscenes from the original PlayStation Final Fantasy games. They’re still fun and well-animated after all these years, but that can’t entirely hide how noticeably they’ve aged. Thankfully, that thick layer of dust is easier to forget about in the heat of battle, especially during its incredible summon sequences, which are the single most visually impressive additions to Reunion. Ifrit’s fiery, lava-filled Hellfire never failed to wow me, nor did Bahamut’s particle effects-heavy Mega Flare. While it’s understandable why Square Enix may not want to completely redo every pre-rendered cutscene, these summons are a tantalizing look at what could have been had they decided to remake all of that footage with modern technology. Animations are greatly improved from the original, but can sometimes feel stiff, particularly when it comes to the way certain in-game scenes are staged. The models themselves look so fresh that it can be jarring when a character unexpectedly moves in a stilted manner, reminding you that, yes, this was originally a PSP game made with the limitations of the time. Still, most dialogue delivery and character movement looks great during in-game cutscenes, and even better in combat. Reunion’s graphical facelift may be what catches your eye initially, but its most substantial improvements are in its gameplay tweaks. Crisis Core was always an action RPG, but the PSP’s single thumbstick and two bumper layout forced Square Enix to get creative with its design, making you shuffle through spells, attacks, items, and more using the left and right bumpers. With a modern controller at your disposal, Zack’s basic attack, dodge, and guard commands are now all mapped to face buttons and triggers, and you can use abilities and cast spells much more quickly by pressing those same buttons while holding L1. If you don’t like how the controls are layed out, you can even remap virtually everything in the pause menu. The DMW system also returns largely unaltered, for better and for worse. Throughout combat, a three-tile slot machine is automatically running in the upper lefthand corner, and when a particular character lines up or certain number combinations are achieved, Zack can get some pretty substantial boosts. Those include temporarily having unlimited MP or getting the ability to execute a powerful Limit Break or Summon. It’s a fun way for combat to feel consistently fresh, but the rate at which these boosts are achieved is incredibly uneven and random, sometimes making a boss a pushover and taking the fun out of figuring out more unique ways to best them. Combat is also faster. A lot faster. Zack can swiftly dodge attacks, roll behind enemies for critical hits, sneak in a few sword slashes, and roll back out of the way to deliver a Firaga blast in a way that makes the original seem downright sluggish. I replayed a bit of it while making my way through Reunion as a refresher, and the difference in pace is simply night and day. Combat still doesn’t feel like it has quite as much depth as the admittedly high bar set by FF7R’s action, and doesn’t benefit from that game’s ability to switch between party members on the fly, but the changes here are still by far the biggest improvement made over the PSP version. Unfortunately, not every aspect of Crisis Core’s gameplay has been updated with the same level of success, and the aging game underneath it all can rear its ugly head again outside of combat. There are some relatively open areas Zack can run around across Midgar and Gaia, but several interior and exterior corridors are often strung together with (thankfully brief) loading screens. And while the 10 story chapters are mostly compelling and typically last about an hour each, Crisis Core’s mission system still offers additional, bite-sized quests originally designed to be played on the go. Most of them aren’t very substantial and almost all boil down to running through the same small number of hallways, randomly encountering enemies, and collecting items from a few chests. Playing these can greatly extend the runtime of the campaign, but I only felt compelled to do a handful of them – some to get additional accessory slots, some for high-powered Materia, and some to see cute story beats from a young, spunky Yuffie. The original game’s fantastic Materia Fusion system returns for Reunion, and lets you combine generally weaker magic, command, special, and support Materia to create stronger and more interesting results. Using the Materia Fusion system, I was able to create the powerful Quake spell relatively early on, and while it allowed me to obliterate large groups of weak enemies almost instantaneously, I still felt like I had earned that strength thanks to some smart fusing. Reunion is also stuffed with simple, distracting minigames that return throughout the story. These distractions almost unfailingly annoyed me until I could get back to the far stronger fights, with activities ranging from slashing down missiles midair to collecting items while on a timer. No matter the task, none are much fun. Thankfully, those don’t slow things down enough to ruin the combat around them, which shines from start to finish even through those distractions. Given how heavily FF7R played with the expectations of fans, I was curious to see if Square Enix was going to adjust Crisis Core’s storyline at all to account for some of the more surprising changes that had occurred, particularly in regards to Zack. However, the main story is identical to what was told in the original game. (Maybe there’s still some sort of unlockable cutscene hiding behind side missions, but I haven’t found it yet if so.) A big change doesn’t exactly feel necessary, either – just like the original Final Fantasy 7’s plot feeds into the changes that occur in Remake, so too does Crisis Core’s, and its story still feels like the most integral entry in the Compilation of Final Fantasy 7 outside of the first game. The events that transpire in Crisis Core add intriguing depth to Cloud, the Turks, and many other characters from Square’s beloved classic and its remake – Sephiroth, in particular, becomes much more humanized during its runtime. It’s easy to play the original Final Fantasy 7 and not really know a thing about Zack, but his story is so pivotal to Cloud’s that his presence towers over it in surprising ways even without much screen time, and his arc in Crisis Core is still as emotional as it was 15 years ago. Voices for characters like Zack, Sephiroth, Aerith, and more have also been replaced by their respective voice actors from FF7R, giving a stronger sense of cohesion between Reunion and the as-of-yet unfinished trilogy of Final Fantasy 7 remakes. However, while the overall story of Crisis Core remains compelling and fascinating as a prequel, there are aspects of the tale that veer towards the endearingly nonsensical flavor of storytelling present in some other Square Enix games. These moments don’t derail the story entirely or anything, but awkward jokes, strange obsessions with what it means to be a monster, and sometimes cringe-worthy dialogue do occasionally distract from the otherwise enjoyable story. Crisis Core –Final Fantasy 7– Reunion pushes the definition of a remaster to the edge, completely renovating the 15-year-old PSP game’s graphics, combat, and more. That said, many of the design choices made for the handheld original – like bite-sized side missions and an abundance of loading screens – are left intact, keeping this experience from feeling completely modern. But even with a few aging quirks, Crisis Core remains a fun, compelling, and integral chapter in the ongoing Compilation of Final Fantasy 7, and Reunion is the absolute best way to experience it. "
90,Dwarf Fortress ,10.0,"Seven dwarves set out from the Mountainhomes to establish a new colony in world rife with gods, monsters, and ancient legends. Though small, these dwarves are the heroes of our tale: Short, sturdy creatures fond of drink and industry. In their ingenuity they will craft incredible artifacts, face great evils, and establish a citadel to stand the test of ages... or they'll dig a little too close to a volcano and flood the whole thing with lava. Then you'll generate another world, with brand new gods, monsters, and ancient legends, and do it all again. All that and more is par for the course in Dwarf Fortress, perhaps the most cult in the pantheon of cult-classic video games, has been generating stories of triumph and tragedy for nearly 20 years already. Its incredible depth has long been locked behind an accessibility barrier of text-based ASCII graphics, arcane keyboard controls, and an inscrutable maze of fan-created mods and tilesets to make it more approachable. And while that admittedly high wall was already worth climbing over, its premium release on Steam brings new graphics and a slew of quality-of-life improvements that fundamentally enhance this amazing game for the next generation of storytellers.  Even if you never dared these intimidating tunnels yourself, you’ve almost certainly felt Dwarf Fortress’ impact elsewhere. Developer Bay 12 Games effectively founded the genre we now call the Colony Sim with its initial release in 2006, paving the way for games like RimWorld while influencing countless others, and it's still a reminder of how this combination of procedural generation and rules-based, reality-driven simulation can create unparalleled stories on the fly. Even today, among its many successors, nothing creates a world and fills it with interesting characters so reliably as Dwarf Fortress, and it is a sublime experience to watch this simulation of a world at work as you play your part in it. Doing so is far easier now. The refreshed graphics use a system of sprites, dynamically assembled, to show the dwarven world in all its glory. There are graphics for hundreds of different animals and animal-men, not to mention for dragons, hydras, unicorns, and the like. Even the special Forgotten Beasts, Titans, and Demons, randomized and unique as they are, have generated appearances to match. Beyond improving on ASCII symbols, the sprites and tiles – both static and dynamic – are a superb example of the pixel artist's craft. This fresh coat of paint is overlaid with a lively new soundscape of nature noises, dwarven work, tavern chatter, and whistling cavern winds that provides an actual sense of place. Atop that is a soundtrack of classical guitar (an homage to the single-track guitar noodling that once accompanied the free version of Dwarf Fortress) that both fits the legacy and includes delights like singing in the actual in-game dwarven language. Perhaps most notably, Dwarf Fortress’ Steam version brings the controls out of the early ‘90s, adding the integrated ability to use the mouse, a fully-fledged graphical interface, and settings menus rather than being forced to directly edit game files if you want to adjust difficulty. The proper mouse support alone is, to me, worth the cost of entry here: You can paint out walls, mining tunnels, and more with ease. More vital for new players, you can click a tile to easily get a tabbed inventory of everyone and everything on it, including quick buttons for basic interactions like forbidding your dwarves to touch it – you know, for when you kill that giant six-eyed cave bird with poisonous blood and your chef immediately tries to get a jump start on tomorrow's dinner. For all that improvement – and it is a shockingly huge and remarkably thorough improvement – Dwarf Fortress is still an unapologetically complex game underneath. Its new tutorials go a long way toward teaching you how to play by setting you up with a world, a relatively safe embark site, and a fortress that can supply its own necessities (e.g. food and booze). Even so, a tutorial still can't teach a tenth of what you’ll likely want to know over the course of your adventure, and those new to this genre will need patience. This is, after all, a game where you have to construct separate workshops to spin plant fiber into thread, then weave thread into cloth, then optionally dye the cloth, before making even a single dwarven sock. It's a game where you'll become an amateur mineralogist – as all good dwarves are – to figure out where in the geological strata to dig for iron, tin, coal, or gold. You'll somehow learn the difference between gabbro and granite. You'll almost certainly read an article describing what a quern is. It sounds like a lot – and it is – but learning real-world information and then being able to immediately employ it in your game is extremely rewarding. One of the biggest conceits in Dwarf Fortress is that you can't directly control your dwarves, outside of actively mobilized military squads. You're a kind of central planner, setting up labor permissions, directing production, and blueprinting their constructions, but how soon any of it happens is up to them. They might be too busy taking a nap, or eating, or listening to the local bard tell a story. And it's delightful that you can't make them do a damn thing, because dwarves each have an entire simulated inner life of their own. They have thoughts, memories, favorite things, personal skills, relationships, and physical traits, all of which you can read about in menus or sometimes see on their sprites. The sheer complexity of the simulation means they’ll occasionally make bizarre decisions because of who they are, and the procedural nature of it all means that those are sometimes hysterical, frustrating, or even poignant. For example, dwarves are infamous for leaving things outside the fortress and then later trying to retrieve them no matter the circumstances. Everyone has their own tales of the time Urist sprinted out into a goblin horde because they forgot their socks in the pasture, or of moments when a horrible beast emerged from the caverns – opposed only by your brave militia – and some hapless child went skipping through the battlefield to go and pick mushrooms in the lower caves. That simulated idiocy can be obnoxious at times, but it can also result in some beautiful stories. I once had two dwarves, a doctor and surgeon, who decided to get married in the middle of an ongoing crisis. As nearby patients cried out in pain amid my hospital room and enemies were at the gates, they had their wedding officiated by their friend, a farmer. Poignant, as though they’d decided that if their lives were threatened they would rather die married than apart. Hilarious, because a patient was still sitting open on the surgical table and everyone involved was spattered with blood as vows were exchanged. In 2019, IGN's own Justin Davis wrote about the wonders of Dwarf Fortress, calling it ""easily the deepest - and maybe most harrowing - sim game out there."" In that article he included the story of one of his own playthroughs: The Helmedstabs Chronicles. You can flip through the entire thing below and see how this particular world went for him in a pre-Steam version of Dwarf Fortress:
Dwarf Fortress is also unapologetic about how much reading is involved, which is reams, as this is a game that generates whole novels worth of tall tales. Basically, none of these stories happen without reading a dwarf's thoughts or observing their relationships in the character menu that pops up when you click on them. The addition of graphics helps, but this is still in many ways a text-based game. You read descriptions of objects, of people, of combat, because Dwarf Fortress focuses all its energy on creating and simulating events that happen, not on rendering them in great detail as they happen. These stories are everywhere in Dwarf Fortress, especially as your fort population climbs into the dozens, and finding them is part of play. Notifications let you know that certain things are happening, but to fully understand them you have to read the event logs, look at the life histories of your dwarves, and spend some time paused just poking around in the day-to-day of your fort. It's deeply rewarding for those who are curious and introspective, or who enjoy roleplaying their fortress inhabitants and figuring out why they do what they do. This is a nerd game par excellence, asking for attention and caring in a vast range of subjects and disciplines, where there is always something new to learn, a challenge to attempt, or an absurd project to try. I don't find all its complexity scary or intimidating; it’s more of a challenge I want to rise to. Building a fort is a sandbox, and you can engage – or not – with many of the systems in Dwarf Fortress to your own heart's desire. I don't like fiddling with windmills and powered pumps, for example, so I rarely use them. The sheer flexibility of the systems in Dwarf Fortress are really only limited by your imagination, your understanding of how they work, and your comprehension of the interface. The procedurally generated worlds pop up remarkably fast, letting you create new ones almost at a whim, each with its own cast of characters, civilizations, artifacts, gods, religions, stories, books, instruments, and more – all with history that stretches back centuries before the “present day” you start in. Not that you need more than one world for hundreds of hours of play, considering they come complete with biomes to build in as diverse as swamps, tundras, grasslands, deserts, badlands, mountains, coastlines, marshes, riversides, and jungles, to name a bare few, and each has good, evil, and savagely primordial variants. As long as you go in knowing that most fortresses end in ruin of one kind or another, you understand that you're here to collaborate with game systems, not fight them. The new controls lend so much power to that style of play; the simple ability to click through the interface makes building workshops and placing furniture a breeze, and letting your dwarves just build them out of whatever material is convenient rather than optimizing exactly what stone is used for a kiln takes some of the busywork out of common tasks. The same goes for above-ground constructions, once a laborious process of scrolling back and forth between the Z-levels of Dwarf Fortress’ 2D top-down map, now made simpler by the convenience of a default view that properly shows what's beneath empty tiles. That's great, because construction is an entire subgame of its own. Placing fortifications and workshops or building guard towers is one end of it, but so is optimizing efficient fortress designs where dwarves travel a minimal distance from their beds to meals and workshops. You can set things up so your fort becomes a hub of crafts and trade, selling carved-stone tchotchkes and baubles to the wider world, or one where dwarf smiths use the secrets of steelmaking to forge an invincible military. You can build a massive statue and light its eyes with magma pulled from the earth's depths, or create a complex system of pumps to irrigate vast caverns for mushroom farming. It's incredibly fun to place sequences of devious traps, like pits that open on a pressure plate, blades that emerge from walls, triggered crossbows, or more elaborate designs: Some of my favorites are entire false entrance ways that open, let in attackers, and then seal before flooding with water or magma. I’ve used minecarts filled with swords that stop abruptly and fling their contents into the enemy at high speed – we call those dwarven shotguns. Or you can opt for the direct approach, where you train a dwarf army and send it off-map to conquer nearby towns or cities, demanding shipments of supplies as tribute. The ultimate fate of all forts is to fall into ruin or be retired when you get bored of its success, and having a fort either get destroyed or simply peter out is part of how you learn the deep systems, gaining ever more knowledge of how to survive dwarven life for next time.  The community's motto has long been that ""Losing is Fun!"", and you'll see players describing doomed ends that range from poisonous monster breath to dwarven civil wars as a potential source of that ""Fun."" You set your own goals – become the new Mountainhome, subjugate your neighbors, or just have the happiest dwarves in the world, among many other possibilities. One of my favorite game challenges to build around comes when you open up the large, subterranean caverns beneath the earth, home to creatures like giant white crocodiles, impish crundles, or pale, blind cave ogres. Opening caves then attracts wandering monster-slaying adventurers who will petition to live in your fort so they can explore the depths, which means you'll probably want to build… a really cool tavern, complete with staff and bards. All adventurers need a tavern, after all. I love to read the combat logs of slayers against monsters. Though the most complex battles in Dwarf Fortress may look like two swarms of blinking sprites smashing into each other on the surface, diving into the details of what's happening both during and after a fight is great. Spears get stuck in bone, limbs are severed, and wounded warriors slip in puddles of their own blood. Desperate fights come down to unarmed struggle, with one side choking the life out of the other. This struggle really means a lot once you get to know the characters in question, by both directing and learning about their lives. Sometimes a good day in Dwarf Fortress is fighting off a dragon attack. Sometimes it's seeing that one of your dwarves likes frogs, and then making some frog statues for their bedroom.  Of course, many of the places where the new version of this vast and beautiful game has flaws are the same as they have been for years. For instance, so much is going on at any given time that performance inevitably suffers as maps grow in size and complexity. The latest version runs smoother than ever, but can slow to a low-FPS crawl when large crowds of characters or creatures show up unexpectedly. Setting high limits and building ever-larger fortresses will inevitably bring what the community calls FPS Death, with forts of more than 200 dwarves becoming unsustainable on any but the beefiest PCs. As always, generating smaller background worlds and picking smaller fortress sites helps – as does stuff like making sure your dwarves throw their dirty socks into a magma-based disposal system to reduce the number of objects that must be tracked in the world. That comes back to the interface, which makes a heroic effort but still struggles to contain the sheer volume of content that Dwarf Fortress contains right off the bat, let alone what it generates during play. Just like its performance, this newest version is leaps and bounds better than its predecessors, but the usability is still limited by your patience with learning where any given piece of information is kept. Dwarves alone have a dozen tabs and subtabs in their information panel, and a single game tile can contain multiple objects to be clicked on and have their descriptions read. That does mean it's much easier to do many things, though. Managing dwarf labors and preferences – like what to do with their trash, what goods to stock at the trade depot, or how many people are on the mining detail – comes down to either a simple checkbox system or categorized lists that have a rudimentary search or sort. But it can still get overwhelmed fast by lots of items, and lacks some basic UI comforts like hotkeys for moving items to the top or bottom of lists. It's not very fun to click a bunch of specific items, all in a row, to trade away. The updated controls are pretty flexible, at least, and let you rebind just about anything. That’s a smart, player-friendly nod to the fact that learning hotkeys and shortcuts will still be important to make any experience playing Dwarf Fortress smooth. For me, learning where every nugget of information is kept and the fastest way to access it is part of the charm. You can't love Dwarf Fortress and also complain that it's too complicated to play – its complexity necessitates its form. In a similar vein, you wouldn’t buy a Porsche or Ferrari and then complain that it requires constant maintenance to reach its potential. Dwarf Fortress is complicated because it is a machine made by two dedicated craftspeople over decades, tuned for precisely one glorious purpose: to generate entire worlds and fill them with endless adventure. If I had to pick one game to play for the rest of my life it would be Dwarf Fortress, because I don’t think I’d ever run out of new and fascinating things to do in the 50 to 60 years the statistics say I have left. Infinitely explorable in its complexity and equally as rewarding in the depth you’ll find there, this is the quintessential world simulation and building management game. Until now its magnificent worlds have been obscured behind inaccessible ASCII art and a difficult interface that only a dedicated few were able to appreciate. But this new Steam version is beefed up with lovely graphics and sound, as well as modern controls and a proper UI, opening the floodgates for a new generation to blissfully drown in its magnificent story engine. What lies within is a genre-defining achievement that – in addition to its place in museums, academic texts, and the hearts of its many devotees – shows how incredible video games can be when a developer has a precise goal and valiantly strives to achieve it, even if the effort takes decades. "
91,Far Cry 6: Lost Between Worlds DLC ,7.0,"While Far Cry 6’s previous DLCs may have put past villains from the series into the spotlight, the latest expansion returns to familiar territory in a different way: by totally jumping the shark. Dropping you back in the shoes of Dani Rojas, Lost Between Worlds is all about an alien entity called Fai that crash-lands in Yara, creating a multitude of time rifts and portals to alternate dimensions. What ensues is a web of interconnected semi-roguelite levels that you’re free to playthrough in any order you want. It’s a genuinely fun way to bring an end to Dani’s story that I found myself happily plowing through all six hours of in a single day, even if it did essentially feel like a watered down version of the main game. Similar to how Far Cry 3 brought us the neon-dripped Blood Dragon, Far Cry 4 gave us a fantastical valley of Yetis, and Far Cry 5 dropped us off on Mars, Lost Between Worlds isn’t afraid to cap off Far Cry 6 by getting a bit weird. Fai’s arrival scattered five shards into alternate dimensions, and it needs your help to find those shards and reassemble its ship to get off the planet. Thankfully, the mere process of shard collecting should save the world from ending as well – convenient, right? The best way I found to have fun with Lost Between Worlds was to just immediately give into a suspension of disbelief. There is no real explanation for an alien craft crashing onto Yara and the sooner I realized that didn’t matter, the sooner I was having fun blasting away at the DLC’s colorful, crystalline enemies.  Far Cry 6 is some of the most fun I’ve had with this series in nearly a decade. Its cast delivers strong performances across an enjoyable story, even if it’s also a fairly predictable one that doesn’t always land the bigger swings it tries to take. And despite some faltering new inventory mechanics and a handful of bizarre design choices, its creative weaponry means taking down an outpost, ransacking a convoy, or even just taking a ride with a buddy has never felt better. Collecting shards means venturing through portals into destabilized twists on the real world called rifts. Each rift looks like a cool, bizarro-world version of Yara and is essentially a self-contained level with a unique quality that poses a new challenge. For example, one rift suffers from periodic lightning strikes, another features a slowly descending spiral of doom from the clouds, and another is totally pitch black other than the pink glow of the precious shard. While venturing through rifts you can also collect sparkling “Glint” fragments. When you die, you can spend Glint to revive at the start of that rift if you have enough – otherwise death means you’ll have to restart your entire run back at the beginning of the rift web with Fai. That’s a welcome failsafe for anybody not as into a more traditional roguelike formula, but I didn’t actually die very often throughout Lost Between Worlds, and rolled credits with a whopping 1,000 Glint saved up. Once you reach the end of a rift, you must pick between two portals (red or blue, naturally) to advance further. The portals are simply gateways to your choice of two other random rifts, and which ones they lead to stay the same for the whole run. That provides a fun sense of variety to mix things up the first time you go through a new portal, but also means you’ll know where it connects if you have to backtrack through a rift later on. Your map even shows you which portal connects to which rift once it’s unlocked, so you don’t have to guess once you’ve visited each rift at least once. After every shard you collect, Fai grants you a new piece of gear to speed your rift travel along. For example, after you bring back the first shard, she will give you a C4-style bomb that can be used to open up shortcuts on subsequent rift visits. Other gadgets include a grappling hook for scaling walls to skip sections and a key for opening previously locked doors that usually contain loot. This is a great progression structure because it dramatically reduces repetition if you’re not required to play through entire rifts all over again every time you visit. Outside of that handful of permanent gear upgrades, any weapons and gadgets you’ve collected along the way will be lost whenever you collect a shard or die trying. Since there are only a handful of weapons to find, I like this feature because it forces you to adapt to whatever is available rather than picking a favorite gun and never switching. In turn, that helps each rift remain entertaining even when you visit it for a second or third time. Since all of the rifts criss-cross and interconnect in various ways, you don’t even have to visit the same rift more than once or twice if you don’t want to. For example, I absolutely hated the rift that requires you to swim around underwater, making you float from bubble to bubble while trying not to drown. It was plain annoying and tedious, like most water levels. So, I just avoided it on all of my other shard collection journeys. I vastly prefer this style of pre-meditated variety over the procedural generation or random rift selection that Ubisoft could have opted for here, letting me play each scenario in the order I preferred. The other major twist Lost Between Worlds introduces is “chromatic combat.” All of the enemies in this DLC are crystallized humanoid creatures that are either purely blue or purely red – in order to damage one, you must shoot them with their matching color by changing your own bullet color on the fly. (Although, for some odd reason, the default keybinding on PC for switching colors is ‘L’, which was obnoxiously inconvenient until I swapped it to my mouse’s thumb button.) Unfortunately, this color-changing idea doesn’t really add much since enemies seem to always spawn in the same places each time you visit a rift and swapping is as simple as a button press. Other than amplifying the other-worldly visuals on display, it’s mostly pointless. That’s especially true since there are only a handful of actual enemy types between your standard assault rifle users, snipers, melee rushers, and shielded machine gunners. I’d have preferred better encounter design or more creative enemy AI over adding a superfluous color-changing layer to combat.  Lost Between Worlds’ web of interweaving levels may be more restrictive than Far Cry 6’s usual open world, but this wild new structure totally works. What Ubisoft lost in vast level design they made up for with a creative alternate dimension concept that encourages replaying levels, unlocking new paths, and mixing up your approach. There isn’t much to the story this time around and the addition of color-coded enemies doesn’t do much to shake up its otherwise untouched combat, but the interesting premise and engaging gameplay loop at least help this add-on outrank the previous villain-focused DLCs. "
92,The Callisto Protocol ,7.0,"A proper remake might be rising from the grave next year, but the festering corpse of Dead Space has come lurching back to life early in the form of The Callisto Protocol. This spiritual successor to the sci-fi survival horror series recreates the haunting blood-streaked hallways and space zombie-slaying hallmarks first established on the USG Ishimura back in 2008, and injects the gore with more awe than ever before thanks to some strikingly detailed splashes of blood and guts. Unfortunately, while the mutant dismemberment has never been more vivid, The Callisto Protocol’s shortcomings appear just as clearly. Occasional control annoyances, imbalanced combat, and a general absence of innovation result in a roughly eight-hour massacre that’s gratifyingly gruesome, but never quite as great as the series that inspired it. Catastrophe has struck the Black Iron Prison facility on the moon of Callisto, and the convicts are revolting; not just in the sense that they’ve escaped their cells and are causing a riot, but also because they’ve been infected by a mysterious virus that’s mutated them all into twisted toxic avengers. It’s up to wrongly incarcerated cargo pilot Jacob Lee to get to the root of the resident evil and find a way off the prison planet, undergoing a claustrophobic crawl through an exceptionally well realized facility in ruin and overrun by lunar-based lunatics. What follows is a fairly linear gauntlet run, but thankfully the team at developer Striking Distance Studios has proven itself to be masterful makers of creepy corridors – rarely are any two passages ever the same and each area is given a distinct sense of place, from the maintenance room decorated with dangling corpses that look like prison guard pinatas, to the frosted-over facilities that lie beyond the prison walls.  Josh Duhamel from the Transformers movies does a commendable job in the lead role, as does The Boys’ Karen Fukuhara as his main ally Dani Nakamura, but the majority of the desperation and discomfort of the pair’s plight is conveyed through the impressive art direction and audio design. With the third-person camera tight on Jacob at all times, you get a clear look at the sweat sheen on his scalp in the humid laundry area, the blood-spatter that soaks his coveralls after each brutal encounter, and the especially icky sewerage that coats his body after he’s forced to wade waist-deep through waste management. Everything is thick and gross in a genuinely palpable way and reinforced by unsettling scrapes and sickening squelches in the darkness around you. And while it’s become a common technique for developers to mask the loading of new areas with the use of narrow gaps in the terrain for players to shimmy through, here they fortify the feeling of dread rather than becoming a drag. As Jacob inched his way through the disgusting pus-boil and tendril-covered caves of Black Iron’s lower levels, his winces on screen mirrored my own looks of unease. The Callisto Protocol's putrid penitentiary had me locked in a state of maximum insecurity. Let’s address the elephant-sized mutant monster in the room, though; The Callisto Protocol is effectively a Dead Space game in everything but name, with Striking Distance Studios even being lead by Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield. From the neatly minimalistic HUD which grafts Jacob’s health bar into the back of his neck like a phone battery indicator, to the stomping of crates and corpses to uncover precious resources, to the combat system that heavily relies on a battery-powered telekinesis ability that allows you to hurl objects around with a flick of Jacob’s wrist. There’s even evidence of a mysterious religious cult that’s somehow involved in the outbreak, and instructions on how to kill enemies left in blood smeared on the walls. It stops short of introducing Isaac Clarke’s stasis ability, and swaps his collection of weaponised mining implements for a more conventional arsenal of pistols and shotguns, but it otherwise feels very familiar – and as someone who’s played all of the Dead Space games, it made for a campaign that was heavy on startling jump scares but light on any major story or gameplay surprises. The biggest deviation that The Callisto Protocol makes from Dead Space’s terror-fueled template is it’s increased emphasis on melee combat, at least during the opening hours. With weapons and ammunition initially scarce, dispatching each snarling cellmate demands that you lure them into an uncomfortably close proximity, sway out of the way of their clawing attacks, and then counter with a flurry of blows from Jacob’s stun baton. The thumbstick-based dodging and blocking of incoming attacks feels a bit like ducking and weaving in a boxing game – except your opponent is less like Holyfield and more like ‘Holy crap!’ – and it feels satisfyingly weighty to bash their limbs off one by one and bludgeon baton-shaped grooves into their skulls. Even as Jacob’s arsenal grows, melee combat remains a smart way to conserve ammo since each successful combo string you land opens up a brief window to perform a ‘skill shot’, allowing you to automatically lock-on to a weak spot with your firearm and down them in a few shots instead of a full clip. I enjoyed the risk-reward choice involved in getting up close and personal rather than trying to more safely pick enemies off from afar, not least because the already tight-in camera pulls even closer to really highlight the carnage as you administer each infected inmate with a lethal injection of hot lead. Unfortunately that high level of tension isn’t sustained once the GRP is introduced. Powerful enough to lift most enemies into the air, this gravity-defying gauntlet can certainly make for some dynamic combat encounters, particularly in tandem with the various deathtraps and volatile objects that are handily positioned around each area. You might enter a room full of ghouls, lift up one and impale him on a spiked wall, throw another into an exposed grinding mechanism, before finishing off a third by hurling a saw blade through their midsection, all before they’ve realised you were ever there. It can be a lot of fun in a jailbreaking Jedi sort of way and it often produces some gloriously gory results, but it also means that major threats are often too swiftly snuffed out, like you’re Indiana Jones bringing a gun to a swordfight. GRP is an ability that depletes and must either be recharged over time or instantly topped up with batteries should you have one in your inventory, so I couldn’t constantly use it as a crutch, but I certainly felt it gave me the force-flinging upper hand in the bulk of enemy encounters even on the ‘maximum security’ difficulty setting – at times making me wonder if the most dangerous monster lurking in Black Iron was actually me. The overpowered nature of the GRP meant I didn’t really bother investing too much in The Callisto Protocol’s weapon upgrade system. I certainly splurged on basic augmentations like expanded clip sizes and recoil dampening, but never felt the need to scrounge up enough Callisto credits to buy the more exotic enhancements. After all, what use are explosive rounds for the riot gun or the homing bullets for the assault rifle, when the ability to throw the ever-present explosive canisters or pick an enemy up and drop them over a ledge is the only alternate fire mode I ever really required? Similarly, stealth sequences fail to induce much in the way of stress. Midway through Jacob’s great escape The Callisto Protocol introduces a deadly blind variant of the infected that are reminiscent of the clickers from The Last of Us. However, although they’re purported to possess an elevated sense of hearing, I found it surprisingly easy to violently shiv them to death right under the nose of other enemies who seemingly wouldn’t bat an eyelid – assuming they have eyes – despite the loud death squeals of their freshly dispatched friends. A far more serious threat are the towering terminator-style security droids that can only be destroyed with a pinpoint headshot – mess it up and you’ll likely be swiftly minced by their high-powered canons – but strangely these genuinely formidable foes are introduced early on and then rarely encountered again. That’s not to say there isn’t a healthy variety of enemy types to tackle in The Callisto Protocol. Although they embody a fairly customary set of survival horror archetypes – standard zombie-types, suicide bombers that rush you, spider-like creatures that scramble on all fours up walls and along ceilings – they all look wonderfully repulsive, and even better when you’re making space jam out of their space guts. Before too long a regenerative ability is introduced that enables basic enemy grunts to transform into more resilient brutes if you wound them without finishing them off completely, which brings a welcome sense of urgency to fights with groups of agitated foes. This is perhaps best exemplified by a late game ride on an underground drilling platform, with hordes of attackers that set upon you from all sides and instantly power-up as a result of being lashed by the shards of flying rock. It’s definitely one of the most heartrate-ratcheting sequences of the entire journey. But elsewhere my anxiety was stirred by the surprisingly slow so-called ‘quick weapon swap’ function. It routinely let me down during the repeated fights against The Callisto Protocol's twin-headed tank-like mini-boss in which my ammunition reserves were rapidly drained. Tapping left on the D-pad swaps out one equipped weapon for another, but the animation of Jacob holstering a weapon and drawing the next is too long and can be accidentally interrupted, meaning there were many times I’d start a weapon switch but perform a dodge to evade an enemy attack immediately afterwards, and then spring back up into a shooting stance to find myself still armed with the exact same weapon I was attempting to holster. Clumsy control issues aside, The Callisto Protocol’s handful of boss fights are disappointingly one-dimensional and never really blew my mind (although they certainly smashed Jacob’s skull on a number of occasions). There are a number of other smaller quibbles that plague The Callisto Protocol. It’s frustrating that opening chests automatically picks up everything inside, meaning I had to continually hop into the inventory screen to drop the skunk gun ammo I never asked for in order to clear space. It seems a bit antiquated that you can only listen to audio logs while you’re standing still with your head stuck in a menu, instead of having them serve as eerie accompaniments to your exploration as they are in games like Dead Space and BioShock. And although having a facehugger leap out of the locker you’re searching might have been a great idea for a jump scare the first time, by the sixth or seventh time it’s just plain annoying, and feels like you’re being forced to endure the same repeated office pranks of an alien April Fool’s day. Lastly, while its eight-hour runtime feels about right in terms of pacing, there’s precious little to do in The Callisto Protocol after you’ve beaten the story. While a New Game+ mode is apparently coming via a free patch at a later date, for now there are no interesting unlockables to speak of that might encourage repeat playthroughs, or any alternative modes to try, making the overall package at launch feel almost as slim as a prison cell mattress. The Callisto Protocol is a supremely atmospheric and action-heavy tour through a spectacular slaughterhouse set in distant space. Its largely linear design makes for minimal backtracking, meaning it trims the fat while leaving no shortage of bone and gristle to rip and tear. However, it also betrays its survival horror roots by regularly tipping the balance of power too far in favour of the player, and while there’s plenty of murderous fun to be had using giant grinding mechanisms to make mulch out of mutants, such cheap thrills come at the high cost of puncturing any tension and dread that the tremendous art and audio design work so hard to invoke. Aside from the meaty melee combat, there’s also the overriding sense that there’s not a lot here that hasn’t been done before – and there’s disappointingly little to do once you’ve beaten the campaign. Thus The Callisto Protocol is a satisfyingly gory spiritual successor to the Dead Space series, but it’s ultimately more of a striking modern mimic than a scary new mutation. "
93,World of Warcraft: Dragonflight Review in Progress,7.0,"Most recent World of Warcraft expansions started with a tightly scripted, story-heavy, and somewhat bothersome on-rails scenario. Dragonflight seems to have remembered that this is an MMORPG and I should be deciding what kind of adventures I want to go on. Right off the boat onto the expansive, beautiful Dragon Isles, you'll be met with only minimal handholding and four huge, exciting zones to explore. But at the same time, Dragonflight feels like a creative step backwards from the experimental – though not always successful – spirit of Shadowlands. There's no denying that the new zones are downright gorgeous. The contrast between volcanic wastelands and verdant river valleys in The Waking Shores is a breathtaking introduction to the expansion. And these locales feature some of the best side quest writing I've seen in WoW in a long time. One of my favorite quests involved sitting and listening to a red dragon, shapeshifted into a humble dwarf, talk about all his regrets and the pain of being banished from his homeland for 10,000 years.  Another one I loved involves traveling slowly, on foot, with a centaur clan to their sacred meeting grounds, complete with a pit stop for a hunting competition. These kinds of heartfelt, memorable moments really are World of Warcraft at its absolute best. They seem to be here to lovingly bonk you over the head and remind you to take your time, simply exist in this beautiful world for a moment. Unfortunately, these handcrafted experiences will dry up after a week or two and you'll be repeating the same, rote daily quests over and over waiting for the next patch to drop, so it's hard to give them too much credit. WoW has generally done a very good job in most expansions making the journey to max level memorable and exciting. And if that's all it needed to be, Dragonflight would hit it out of the park. But as a living MMO, WoW consistently struggles to maintain that level of engagement for me in the weeks and months to come, and Dragonflight is not really any exception. Where Dragonflight really does try to spread its wings, figuratively and literally, is in the design of the new Dracthyr Evoker class. And I have to admit, they're pretty freaking cool. Having a racial soar ability and signature, dragon-themed attacks like Deep Breath let you come screaming out of the skies and bathe your enemies in fire before they even know what hit them. It's simply awesome. However, both the damage-dealing Devastation and healing-focused Preservation specs suffer from having too many niche-use combat abilities and can feel very chaotic and disorienting to play. Especially compared to WoW's last hero class, the delightfully straightforward Demon Hunter, Evokers are just a bit overdesigned. Where the Dracthyr can glide, however, the new dragon riding system allows all of your characters to soar. Zooming over the landscape at up to three times the speed of WoW's traditional ""flying"" mounts, I feel like I can't ever go back to that old system. It feels incredible when you're soaring, banking, and diving around with a palpable sense of momentum and physicality that WoW normally lacks. Dragon riding challenge courses with cosmetic rewards for the best times have easily been some of my favorite parts of this expansion. Though I found it was a bit too easy to get gold on all of them, leaving me with little reason to go back.I'm not a huge fan of how these dragons control on a mouse and keyboard, though. They seem to be begging for controller support, which has long been rumored but never actually manifested. The main story, so far, hasn't exactly wowed me as much as the side quests. If you didn't follow all of the out-of-game lore leading up to Dragonflight, you might be a bit confused about why you're even here in the first place. There is some tension between the major good guys, but it rings kind of hollow. The new bad guys, the primal dragons and their humanoid minions, the Primalists, haven't yet made an impression as especially complex or interesting villains. There does at least seem to be some sort of succession crisis brewing within the Black Dragonflight that has the promise of delivering interesting stories down the line. The eight new dungeons are relatively straightforward and unmemorable, with the standout being The Nokhud Offensive in which you use your dragon riding skills to soar around and intervene in a battle that takes up a huge, instanced portion of the Ohn'ahran Plains zone. They seem to have been designed to avoid the problem of pick-up groups insisting on wacky routes that skip most of the trash fights by exploiting the level geometry, which was a big issue in Shadowlands. But overall, these dungeons are just kind of… meh. On the bright side, the new Mythic+ season is bringing back four legacy dungeons from Mists of Pandaria. Keeping things fresh by letting us revisit some of the best content from WoW's 18-year history is such a no-brainer, and I hope they keep it up. The first raid, Vault of the Incarnates, hasn't exactly taken my breath away yet either. There are some interesting and satisfyingly difficult mechanics to learn: one encounter involves a council of elemental sorcerers who have to be killed almost simultaneously in a nod to Molten Core's classic Core Hounds fight, while another involves a giant rock elemental who must be tricked into destroying his own damaging towers with a smash attack. The complexity of the fights is just about right for normal mode, and the visual design of the bosses is pretty strong, but I didn't find the vault itself that interesting in terms of its art or overall theme – especially when you compare it to something like Shadowlands' debut raid, Castle Nathria. There's nothing particularly notable about any of the individual arenas and I don't even know who most of these jerks are! It's worth noting at the time of writing that I haven't yet seen the final fight with Razageth, though. The new crafting system is probably the best it's ever been in WoW's history, with varying qualities of materials and different results for finished products based on your skill level and progression choices. When I make myself a pair of Tier 5 leather pants, I know every stat on those bad boys is as high as it is because my Leatherworking skill is so much higher than the recipe calls for, because I specialized into leather pants specifically, and because I chose to use only the finest bear asses in their manufacture. Though I suspect, as you can eventually max out everything, that this specialness will diminish the longer the expansion sticks around. The problem is, it's still very grindy. Dragonflight has tried to respect our time more by giving us fewer daily chores to do, with even standard ""daily"" quests resetting once or twice a week instead of every 24 hours. But for crafters, you're still expected to farm the same overworld monsters for dozens of hours just to make one piece of epic gear, on top of the fact that the new Spark of Ingenuity item only lets you make one per week anyway. This would be the perfect place to plug in something like Shadowlands' Maw zone or randomized solo dungeons in the spirit of Torghast. Or make them a reward for doing repeatable dragon riding challenges! Anything skill-based, rather than farming the same unchallenging mobs forever like I'm in Purgatory. C'mon Blizzard, I'm begging you. It's not 2004 anymore and this is not good gameplay. I can hear the cries of, ""Choreghast!"" already. But there has to be a happy medium here somewhere. Mostly solo players like me should be able to have those kinds of features available to us without making players who don't like them feel obligated to do them constantly. Blizzard could let us use our progress in what I'll call ""high-end solo content"" as a substitute, not an addition to, other ways to boost our weekly vault earnings, for instance. You can run this randomized, Hades-style dungeon with temporary, collectible power-ups or do Mythic+, but no one has to do both. It sounds like a win-win. Or, even better, they could make it an efficient way to farm stuff like Awakened elemental materials, as a replacement for the plainly worse gameplay of putting on a podcast, zoning out, and farming overworld mobs or flying around looking for dirt piles for hours on end. Stuff like Torghast, in particular, made me feel listened to as a type of player who usually isn't a priority in the admittedly difficult balancing act Blizzard must play satisfying so many players. Did it need more iteration? Of course. But Dragonflight absolutely suffers in my eyes for providing no equivalent. Cutting stuff like Covenant Sanctums, the mission table, and having to keep track of 200 different currencies was wise. But they cut too much here. Dragonflight reignites the sense of wonder and exploration that originally drew me to World of Warcraft, for about the first 30 or 40 hours. Beyond that, it definitely starts to feel a bit threadbare. Dragon riding is fun as hell, and I love the design of the new zones. But this expansion's back-to-basics approach is very much a double-edged sword. I probably won't burn out as fast because there aren't a million things to do every day just to feel like I'm keeping up like there were in Shadowlands. But at the same time, I don't feel like there's enough to do that's genuinely interesting once I've cleared all the very well-written side quests. An excellent new crafting system is gated behind mind-numbing amounts of mindless grinding for resources, in addition to weekly caps, which feels like a double jeopardy situation. I like Dragonflight, but I fell out of love with it not long after hitting max level. I really hope Blizzard looks at this as a rebuilding year for WoW, and doesn't hesitate to iterate on some of the inventive ideas in Shadowlands that were maybe only a step or two away from being great.

94,Marvel's Midnight Suns ,8.0,"One of my favorite things about watching superheroes duke it out is when someone gets smacked so hard they fly backwards and crash through solid walls, explode tanker trucks, or slam into their friends. It’s an awesome demonstration of just how strong these godlike characters are supposed to be, and it’s always a disappointment when a superhero game doesn’t quite capture that feeling. With Marvel’s Midnight Suns, however, Firaxis has built a deep and innovative turn-based tactical combat system around the joy of having Iron Man, Dr. Strange, Blade, and more knock enemies around like toys they're trying to break – and that hasn’t gotten old in the roughly 75 hours of its surprisingly expansive RPG campaign. A lot of that time isn’t spent in battles, though, and while it’s certainly appealing to get up close and personal with this cast of more than a dozen popular and lesser-known Marvel heroes, it does tend to go a bit overboard with convincing Earth’s mightiest heroes to all be your BFFs.   The full-on supernatural theme of Midnight Suns immediately sets it apart from the Marvel games we’ve gotten in recent years. This story is very loosely based on the Marvel Comics series Midnight Sons, and centers on the corrupt witch Lilith returning from the dead to claim the Darkhold (the evil spell book featured in Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness) on behalf of an even more evil god. That apocalyptic mystical threat isn’t terribly novel in of itself, but the family relationships around it make it more interesting: Lilith is the mother of our character, a Commander Shepard-style blank slate known as The Hunter, and her sister is Caretaker, a powerful witch who serves as the Midnight Sun’s Professor X-like mentor. There’s a lot of history between them to delve into – literally, in that Lilith and Caretaker are hundreds of years old and date back to the Salem Witch Trials – and the story uses Lilith’s ability to twist the minds of heroes and villains alike to great effect in creating strife and division among our heroes. With such a long campaign – at least 60 hours, but I’m at more like 75 or 80 now – just about everybody in the cast gets some time to shine, from the world-famous Spider-Man to the more obscure magical heroes like the Runaways’ Nico Minaru and Colossus’ sister Illyana “Magik” Rasputin, who both take central roles in the fight against Lilith. Right off the bat, Midnight Suns’ style of combat is radically and refreshingly different from Firaxis’ genre-defining XCOM games. For one thing, each member of your three-person team you take on a typical mission has their own customizable deck of eight cards representing everything from Spider-Man’s THWIP!!! web-stunning attack to Dr. Strange’s Winds of Watoomb tornado, forcing you to think on your feet in order to make the best possible use of the hand you’re dealt. As a big fan of card games like Slay the Spire and Monster Train (and recently Marvel Snap) I’m absolutely on board with this idea – the unpredictability of it keeps me from falling into the rut of repeating the same routine every battle once I find something effective. Having just a few cards in your hand isn’t as limiting as you might think, since you can discard and redraw any at least a few every turn to replace those that aren’t useful in your situation (and you can increase the number of redraws per turn with consumable items or card upgrades). It’s rare that I’ve found myself unable to act, and it’s not unusual that you’ll draw exactly the card you want. Another excellent aspect of this system is that all your characters draw from the same pool of (usually) three “card plays” and one movement action per turn. That means that one person getting knocked out doesn’t instantly reduce your available actions by a third – you lose access to that hero’s cards, but those who are left standing can still use all of the turn’s allotted moves. So you’re at a disadvantage until you can revive them, but it’s not so great that you’re pulled into the downward spiral of failure that can happen in XCOM and other squad-based games – but it certainly doesn’t mean Midnight Suns is easy. Superheroes don’t take cover in a fight and they don’t miss their shots, so instead of getting entrenched and using suppressive fire to win shootouts, these mostly small-scale missions are exciting slugfests where staying alive is all about quickly taking enemies out – or at least weakening them before they get to move. Directing their attacks away from your weakest hero with taunts and buffing your allies with armor and resistances is key to mitigating the damage, and a lot of the guesswork is taken out of it by icons above enemies' heads indicating who they plan to attack on their turn. The rhythm of combat involves picking off weak fodder enemies using basic attack and skill cards (those with the “quick” trait refund your card play if you knock out a target, extending your turn) to build up Heroism points, which can then be spent on powerful Heroic cards like a hail of missiles from Iron Man’s shoulders that damages every enemy on the screen or Wolverine's armor-piercing claws, or satisfying environmental attacks like dropping a street lamp on a group of enemies or vaulting off a table to come crashing down on a target from above. It’s fantastic when it all comes together to let you clear out one of these close-quarters arena maps before the inevitable wave of enemy reinforcements charges in from off-screen to keep the action going. Firaxis’ animators have done an excellent job of making these turn-based fights feel energetic. That so much of it is built around smacking enemies with extreme force works extremely well with high-powered heroes like Iron Man and Captain Marvel, and using Spider-Man’s webs to fling objects into bad guys’ faces from across the map is very on-brand. With all of that knockback in play positioning is extremely important – you have to think about how to approach a target and how to set up more damaging hits. On that note, I love how every hero has a distinctive flavor to the way they move and attack, whether it’s flying, levitating, teleporting, or swinging, and the powerful team-up attacks put on a good show as two heroes take turns beating the living hell out of a target. When you scale up to the over-the-top late-game abilities the animations are a whole lot of fun to watch, and it's all set to a rousing Avengers-esque score. Mixing heroes like Magik and Ghost Rider into your squad gives you the ability to open portals in the floor (into Limbo and/or Hell) and kick enemies into it for an instant knockout, which is one of the few major places in Midnight Suns where a roll of the dice determines if an attach is successful or not. Considering this requires you to spend a move and may not do any damage at all, it’s a gamble – but it can pay off big if you can remove a beefy enemy from the map in one move.  While the maps you do battle on are consistently small and flat with only a handful of objects on them for you to slam enemies with or into, there are a fair number of backdrops to keep visual diversity up and a good variety of objectives beyond simply defeating all the enemies. There are hazards that make you keep your squad moving to avoid danger zones, shield-bearing enemies that have to be broken through to reach a target, Hydra VIPs that must be captured, bombs that must be disabled, and so on. You can also keep things interesting on straightforward battles by opting into side objectives where you need to, for example, use a specific character to deal 250 damage within two turns. Between those factors and occasional boss encounters with Venom, Sabertooth, Crossbones, and more – each with their own unique mechanics – missions rarely felt like I was stuck in a loop. Of course, Midnight Suns’ combat does have some annoying quirks to get used to: because positioning is so important it's a bit frustrating that you can’t really control where your characters will land after an attack (though it does preview the location for you before you play a card), and because there’s no grid it can be a pain to find the exact right place to cast an area-of-effect attack to hit multiple targets or to get an environmental attack to line up just right. The main thing that still throws me off, though, is that it’s easy to accidentally move a character when you’re trying to make them shove an enemy, and once you do that you've burnt that shove move for this turn. While I’ve come to love it, I admit that Midnight Suns' battles did take a little while to grow on me. The opening hours are a lot to take in, and at the same time you’re trying to wrap your head around this dramatically different new combat system you’re barraged with what feels like way too many currencies for upgrades (each of the three card types has its own) and relationships and other stats to manage, and of course each character’s individual deck of cards – including Hunter’s, which are a mixture of light and dark cards that give you a good range of options for how you’d like them to play, focusing on support abilities that heal or grant armor or going all-in on damage dealing. I also made the mistake of taking on a lot of early side missions, which turns out to be unwise because a lot of things that haven’t been unlocked at that stage. For example, if you don't unlock the ability to do extra damage by knocking an enemy into one of your own teammates you're just making things harder than they need to be. When Venom randomly showed up in an already difficult situation (boss characters can drop into normal missions unexpectedly, similar to XCOM 2’s Chosen) it took me around two hours of stubbornly retrying it to figure out how to survive that mission.  But by the time I’d made my way through the first act of the surprisingly long story, things had really clicked into place, and I found myself greatly enjoying the challenge of maximizing the potential of the hands I’m dealt. Having a wider selection of cards to work with and the ability to upgrade and augment them with bonuses, like increasing their power when you spend a redraw on them or inflicting bleeding on a target, expanded my options significantly and made each character feel more tailored to my preferred style.  I did end up having to tone the difficulty down during that second act. I’d ambitiously cranked it up three levels as they’d unlocked based on my scores in some early missions, but when the generic Hydra soldiers were replaced by a bigger variety of tougher demonic enemies (such as the creepy guys who can clone themselves and others) I started hitting walls where my current understanding of how to optimize a deck just wasn’t up to the task. So I went back down to just one notch above the default for the rest of my run, and that put me in a good place – but I’m looking forward to a future playthrough (maybe when the planned DLC characters Deadpool, Storm, Venom, and Morbius arrive) where I can plan out my decks with a better understanding of how upgrades work and which cards I can sacrifice for extra resources to level up and enhance the ones I like. Turning up the difficulty increases your rewards for beating missions quickly and without anyone getting knocked out, and it’s a really smart system. Doing well doesn’t make you much stronger (if you’re doing that well you don’t need a lot of help there anyway), it just makes you look cooler doing it by increasing the amount of Gloss currency you have to spend on unlocking new costumes and leisure wear for Hunter and the rest of the gang, among other things. With at least a few costume options for everyone, each with multiple color palettes, to earn it’s a good incentive to push yourself to improve on the battlefield. Before you can pay Gloss to enable them, though, you have to find those cosmetic items, and most of them come from exploring the grounds around the Midnight Suns’ home base, a castle-like building known as the Abbey. I generally enjoyed the parallel story that unfolds here, wherein the ghost of Agatha Harkness sends you looking for clues to missing memories of Hunter and Lilith’s previous conflict, and retracing the events that lead to her own death. It’s certainly a major change of pace from battles, though that’s not always a good thing because it can feel like a big time-sink: there’s a lot of aimless wandering alone across the moderately sized, maze-like map, which is almost entirely devoid of NPCs of any kind, as you search for pieces of puzzles. During that time I encountered a few frustrating bugs where items weren’t interactable at first or a solution didn’t work until I tried it multiple times. Also, while there’s a set of four different powers you get here that aren’t available at all in combat, they aren’t used very creatively and mostly serve to unlock areas that’ve been gated off. It becomes very straightforward that you need to use the Open spell to open locked doors, the Purify spell to clear obstructions made of vines, and Reveal whenever you see the eye symbol.  The third major part of Midnight Suns is the aggressive befriending of everyone on the team, and it’s here that things can become a bit awkward. We do get to explore every hero’s backstory and what led them to join the Suns, along with interpersonal conflicts between the visiting Avengers and the resident magic users, and a lot of that is done well and brings depth to the characters. The writing is usually strong and often funny – Tony Stark and Dr. Strange have some of the best banter as they work to solve problems with their technological and magical approaches, Nico’s rebelliousness puts her constantly at odds with Caretaker, and Blade is dark and intense but also nursing a secret crush. There’s a lot to like about each of them, even the vacuous young Ghost Rider, Robbie Reyes, and the voice acting holds it all up fairly well. These iterations of known characters feel distinct; the only one I’d accuse of doing an impersonation of their Marvel Cinematic Universe counterpart is Tony Stark. Having recently replayed the Mass Effect trilogy I couldn’t help but notice a fair amount of similarity to how you chat up your teammates and earn points for being a goodie-two-shoes or an abrasive jerk at every opportunity (or taking the more neutral option), with each character having their own preference for how they’d like you to act. Nico, for example, is generally fishing for a dark answer when she’s venting about Caretaker, while Steve Rogers is exactly what you’d expect. Like nearly everything else, that system feeds into combat by unlocking items that give Hunter passive bonuses, so there’s a good reason to be consistent with your choices even if you’re not into roleplaying.  As for Hunter, they aren't a bad character, but they’re kind of set up for failure by being placed next to legendary comic book heroes like Iron Man, Captain America, and Spider-Man, among others that we already know and love – they never really stood a chance of being as memorable. My Hunter – a male who almost exclusively chooses the “light” dialogue options (my standard choice for a first playthrough of a game like this) – tends to alternate between a self-serious crusader against his mother’s evil and kind of a goofy dork who always wears sunglasses at night, and that was kind of endearing. I don't expect a dramatic change in how events play out when I eventually revisit it with a different approach, though. What made me cringe here and there, though, was the fact that so much of Midnight Suns is spent getting all of these heroes to really like Hunter. It takes on the tone of self-insertion fan fiction, where you write a story in which you get to meet all your favorite characters and they’re constantly telling you how cool you are and how much they love being friends with you. To be fair, we see a lot of this same relationship-building in other similar party-based RPGs of the BioWare style, but in this case the fact that our character is the only one who isn’t drawn from the existing Marvel Comics universe and largely already know each other gives it a bit of a different flavor when everyone is quickly fawning over you. Of course, there’s gameplay value in participating in all of the various book clubs and surprise parties and soaks in the Abbey’s grotto pool: leveling up friendships unlocks powerful passive abilities for each character when in combat and eventually unlocks their Midnight Suns costumes and most powerful card, so it’s worthwhile. Speaking of payoffs, though, it’s odd that in a game where we spend so much time buttering up a group of mostly attractive people by showering them with compliments and thoughtful gifts suited to their interests, and unlocking their swimsuit options, all of these friendships are completely platonic. (I believe canonically makes our character the only person Tony Stark hasn’t tried to bang.) There are quite a few conversations, especially with Magik, where it seemed poised to take a romantic turn but nothing came of it, and that can be anticlimactic coming from games like Mass Effect, Dragon Age, and The Witcher. I wouldn’t be at all surprised if Marvel vetoed the idea of romance options with its established characters, but as it is a more appropriate superhero name for Hunter might’ve been Captain Friendzone. With Marvel’s Midnight Suns, Firaxis has put itself in the league of RPG developers like BioWare, Obsidian, Bethesda, and Larian. Its innovative turn-based hero combat system takes a bit of time to get going, but once it does it makes excellent use of card game mechanics to keep battles fresh, evolving, and unpredictable over the course of an epic-length campaign – bashing enemies into things for increased damage is endlessly entertaining. The supernatural apocalypse story is given emotional weight by the family relationship between the hero and villain at the heart of it. Building intense friendships with famed Marvel superheroes we’ve seen in comics, movies, and games for decades does tend to feel forced and weird, but learning all their backstories and conflicts with teammates can be intriguing, and the fact that nearly everything you do outside of combat makes you more powerful in the next fight means it all tends to be worth doing. "
95,Gungrave G.O.R.E ,6.0,"Gungrave G.O.R.E has exactly one mission objective, three words that flash across the screen at the beginning of each level and every time you die: Kick their ass. For the 12-15 hour campaign, you’ll do exactly that – shoot, slash, blow up, and otherwise execute thousands of enemies and bosses on your quest to eradicate the Raven Clan and save the world from an evil drug called SEED. When it works, which is often, Gungrave G.O.R.E is a captivating ballet of blood and bullets that merges Gungrave’s signature style with the best aspects of modern action games. Unfortunately, for everything Gungrave G.O.R.E does right, there are an equal number of frustrations and missed opportunities, making it difficult to recommend to anyone outside of action game aficionados or hardcore Gungrave fans. Gungrave G.O.R.E picks up where Gungrave VR and Gungrave VR U.N left off. You don’t have to have played any previous Gungrave games or seen the anime adaptation to pick up what G.O.R.E is laying down, though it will definitely help – if you’re new to the series, there’s a short video explaining its history to help you along. The setup is a bit goofy: SEED, a drug with a knack for transforming its users into monsters that was thought to be eradicated, has actually survived. This time, it’s being sold by the Raven Clan, so Mika, Beyond the Grave (Grave to his friends, and your main protagonist), Dr. Aso, newcomer Quartz, and the rest of the rather forgettable El-Al Canhel head to Scumland to stop SEED production and take the Raven Clan, and its four bosses, down.  Things escalate from there, of course, but Gungrave G.O.R.E’s plot and characters are never strong enough to provoke more than passing interest in what’s going on. Grave is silent as his namesake (he has less than five lines in the entire game, none more than four words long), and the other characters are mostly there to deliver exposition. It doesn’t help that the voice acting is also all over the place and the translation is pretty hit or miss – there are noticeable grammar errors in the written text and weird turns of phrase that don’t sound natural in English. Almost all of G.O.R.E’s story is delivered in cutscenes. In missions, you’ll mostly just have Quartz guiding you from point A to point B with a lot of recycled and unhelpful dialogue like “Grave. They are coming from all sides!” or “There’s the exit,” which gets old pretty fast. G.O.R.E’s story is only there to give you a reason to travel the world, meet new people, and kill them. The action is really what you’re here for, and Gungrave G.O.R.E does more or less deliver on that. Grave has several abilities at his disposal: a pair of pistols, a charged shot, a big coffin to swing around for various three-hit combos, Demolition Shots (special abilities that cost charges you build up by dealing damage), the ability to reflect certain projectiles, a dodge, and a jump. Pretty standard stuff, but what makes Grave interesting to play are his special abilities. You can grab enemies with Death Hauler, Grave’s coffin, and use them as a human shield, or enter Burst Mode by shooting repeatedly while standing still, which allows Grave to deal massive amounts of damage very quickly. Grave can’t move in Burst Mode, but you can rotate the camera to take out enemies around you. Grave can also execute enemies at low health, which will recover his shield much faster than if you recharge it over time. Of course, it’s not just about killing enemies; you have to look stylish doing it, too. The goal is to drive up Grave’s Beat Count as high as you can by constantly hitting enemies and grabbing a high Art score, which comes from executions, melee combo finishers, and Demolition Shots. Maintaining a high Beat Count is tricky; it disappears very quickly if you’re not hitting or shooting something, which pushes you to constantly be on the attack. It’s a fun challenge to drive it up during encounters and then maintain it between them by shooting objects in the environment, like cars, boxes, or neon signs. Play your cards right, and it’s possible (if difficult) to drive up your Beat Count into the thousands. Getting your Beat Count over 50 even gives you access to Storm Barrage, a rapid-fire attack that hits enemies in all directions and will quickly drive your Beat Count higher when used against large groups. The trick is managing all of it. Demolition Shots, for instance, restore health but don’t contribute to your Beat Count, no matter how many enemies you hit with one, though they do give you Art score. Executions provide a shield recharge and up your Art score, but only add one to the Beat Count. Managing all of these things well, along with Grave’s health and shield, can feel great when it all comes together. The shooting is loud and impactful, Demolition Shots are amazing, and executions are appropriately stylish and gory. Melee attacks never quite feel as weighty or damaging as they should, but when you’re pulling off high Beat Counts and landing Demolition Shots, Gungrave G.O.R.E feels fantastic. Unfortunately, everything else is more mixed. Levels are gorgeous, and Gungrave G.O.R.E takes you through a ton of different environments throughout its campaign, from the dirty alleys of Scumland to neon-soaked streets of Hong Kong and the forests of Vietnam, among others. Each place looks, feels, and plays a little differently, and Studio Iggymob has done a great job of imbuing each location with a distinct vibe. The issue is that levels themselves are entirely linear affairs; there are side rooms and small detours, but there’s no reason to ever explore them unless there are enemies there. There are no collectibles to find, no optional objectives to complete, nothing. All you need is kill, which is good because that’s all you're going to do. The other problem is the enemies themselves. You’ll have seen most of the enemies Gungrave G.O.R.E has to offer by the time you hit the 10th level (of 31 total), and many of the ones you’ll see after that are just variations. Instead of “guy with rocket launcher,” you might see “guy with rocket launcher that shoots four rockets,” or “guy with rocket launcher that shoots really fast and does lots of damage.” Instead of your standard, SEED-infused Orgman bruiser, you might see one with claws that moves faster and hits harder. These variations aren’t a problem on their own, but when levels reuse the same few enemies over and over again, it can get old. This is especially noticeable in the last few levels, which feature a grand total of four enemy types. Gungrave G.O.R.E also likes to throw enemies at you that have to be dealt with in specific ways, greatly limiting your combat options. If an enemy is equipped with a shield, for example, you cannot under any circumstances break that shield by shooting at it normally. You have to hit it with melee attacks, a charged shot, deflect a rocket into it, use an environmental explosion, or use specific Demolition Shots. That might not sound bad, but melee attacks are slow and will often miss enemies they should hit, a charged shot requires that you stop shooting long enough to charge it, which means potentially losing your Beat Count, and Demolition Shots are a resource. Even then, Demolition Shots and charged shots will often only destroy a single shield, even if you hit multiple shielded enemies with those attacks. And you have to deal with them immediately; Grave may be powerful, but he’s also slow, and shielded enemies will run right up in your face to stop you from targeting their friends, knock you down, and hit you out of – or sometimes through – your attacks. Worse still, all of that just gets rid of the shield itself. You still have to kill the guy holding it after the fact. Enemies with powerful guns or rocket launchers are the same way. If you don’t deal with them immediately, you’re probably going to die because G.O.R.E loves to have several of them attack you at a time, their attacks are very difficult to dodge (you can’t really dodge a guy with a machine gun, and rockets basically have to be deflected because they track you) and they hit really hard. All of this makes combat less about using all of Grave’s options and more about using whatever the “right option” to deal with that specific type of enemy is. Gungrave G.O.R.E is better when it’s letting you come up with creative solutions to encounters, but enemies like this shut that down completely. Boss encounters are much better. G.O.R.E offers a huge variety of bosses to fight, some of which have several phases. Barring a couple of exceptions later on, each is extremely unique and almost all of them are quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, levels don’t start regularly having boss fights until you’re more than halfway through the campaign. Most of the time, a stage will end with a big fight against a ton of smaller enemies, or just stop once you reach a certain point. The former is fine, but the latter is incredibly jarring and can really take you out of the experience. I wish I could say that all of the levels themselves were great, but they’re also extremely hit-and-miss. In general, Gungrave G.O.R.E tends to get better as it goes on, but even that feels like an incomplete description. Early levels, however, are definitely less fun; most of them lack boss fights, and G.O.R.E has a bad habit of throwing gimmicks at you. One level, for instance, requires Grave to navigate the top of a moving train, avoiding passing signs and oncoming tunnels. This is fine in theory, but Grave is a slow character, and he’s strongest when he isn’t moving. Taking out the enemies around you efficiently, especially early on, when you have a limited moveset, means standing still to use Burst Mode, which opens you up to running into a passing sign or not getting inside the train before you hit a tunnel. Hitting a sign is bad (it will cost you all of your shield and about half of your health) but being atop the train when it goes into a tunnel means instant death and having to redo the entire segment. Avoiding the signs and trying to move quickly opens you up to enemies with rocket launchers and shields, both of which do high damage and can knock you off the train, which, you guessed it, results in instant death and having to do the entire section again. Difficulty spikes like these make the early game incredibly frustrating. Generally, you’re not dying because you made a mistake, but because you don’t yet have the tools or abilities to deal damage quickly enough. By far the worst example I ran into was the sixth level, where Grave has to hold off a large group of what are, at the time, a lot of really tough Raven Clan enemies. I spent over an hour attempting this segment, but no matter what I did, I couldn’t deal enough damage fast enough. There were simply too many enemies in too small an area, all of whom demanded I deal with them in a specific way, which usually left me vulnerable to something else. I eventually had to turn the difficulty on that encounter down a notch, and that suddenly let me clear it on the first try. Gungrave G.O.R.E actually encourages you to switch difficulties if things get too tough, but it feels bad when the reason you have to do so is that your damage output isn’t up to some arbitrary standard because it didn’t give you enough points to buy the upgrades you need yet. When I came back to that same level later with more abilities, I was able to beat it on the normal difficulty pretty easily. Speaking of upgrades, you can buy them at the end of each level or from the main menu. You gain points by completing levels, and G.O.R.E scores you in five categories: time, kill rate, life remaining, highest Beat Count, and Art Score on a scale from D to S. It then averages the results for a final score, and points are awarded based on how well you do. Initially, it’s hard to score well – you simply don’t have the abilities you need to maintain high Beat Counts (for reference: a Beat Count in the 300s on most levels will earn you a C) or Art scores, but it becomes easier as you unlock abilities. Once you have points to spend, you can head to The Lab. There’s a lot to buy: health, shield, and damage upgrades, new melee combos and skills, and new Demolition Shots. As you purchase new stuff, G.O.R.E opens up considerably, and combat becomes much easier and more enjoyable. You can also refund your abilities at any time for their full purchase price, which can be very helpful if you’re stuck. A one-on-one boss fight, for instance, is a lot easier if you max Grave’s targeting range and bullet damage instead of his Storm Barrage, which you’ll mostly use for crowd control and building high Beat Counts against large groups. Unfortunately, all the upgrades can’t hide how limited Grave’s moveset is. He never acquires new weapons – the twin pistols and coffin are it – so his playstyle never really changes. New moves can only iterate on what you already have. G.O.R.E does offer two other playable characters, Bunji and Quartz, but they’re only there for one level each and, in Bunji’s case, a small portion of a later level. Their playstyles are a welcome change-up: Bunji is like a faster Grave who can dodge while in Burst mode, and I enjoyed playing him more than I did Grave. Quartz, on the other hand, is more mixed. She’s a melee character in a game not really built for melee characters, and while her moveset is a nice change of pace, it’s not much more than a novelty. You only get each character for a short time, and you can’t upgrade their abilities or buy them new ones. What they come with is what they get. It feels like a huge missed opportunity, especially since Grave never gets anything to really change up his playstyle – you can’t even rebind your controls if you don’t like how things are set. When you get right down to it, most of Gungrave G.O.R.E feels like a missed opportunity. There’s a great combat system here, but the lack of variety and repetitive enemy design often let it down. The art, courtesy of Trigun’s Yasuhiro Nightow and Ikumi Nakamura, is fantastic and oozes style, but the story told in that attractive setting isn’t very interesting. The music and sound design are largely wonderful, too, but the voice acting is a little uneven. I can easily see its potential, but a mishmash of missteps prevent Gungrave G.O.R.E from ever reaching it. "
96,Evil West ,7.0,"When I think about what the real world would be like if it were overrun by vampires, werewolves, and zombie-like shambling corpses, that imaginary apocalypse doesn’t evoke nearly as much maniacal cackling from me as the one in Evil West. From the Tesla-inspired electricity weapons to the gratuitous gore and bloodshed, this old-school action game was some of the most fun monster murdering I’ve done in a while – unfortunately, its formulaic structure also make it some of the most repetitive. Evil West’s roughly 12-hour linear campaign is spread across 16 different missions that all follow the same format. Each level has a clear start and end point with collectibles sprinkled along the way, broken up by throngs of enemies that assail you until you get a dialogue break during the next cutscene. While you’re technically free to explore levels a bit to find lore items or gold pouches, aka “bucks” for purchasing upgrades, the crux of your adventure is walking from one fight to the next and eventually capping missions off with a boss battle. Fortunately, the environments between each combat encounter are truly sights to behold with enough picturesque backdrops that range from the outlandish to the beautiful to make even the grumpiest cowboy shed a tear.  The formula of Evil West’s levels is rarely mixed up save for a few unique situations, such as a wacky mine cart segment or the handful of times you walk around the base camp while being spoon fed exposition. Its story puts you in control of Jesse Rentier from The Rentier Institute, an organization founded by Jesse’s father to hunt down and eradicate all manner of vampires and other foul beasts. Developer Flying Wild Hogs really latched onto the whole “Wild West, but Weird” idea and ran away with it screaming. You’ve got Illuminati-esque floating pyramids, portals to hell, and demonic little girls with skin-crawling voices. It’s a tale riddled with entertaining expletives and truly distinct characters, such as the fiercely opinionated doctor, Emilia Blackwell, so there’s never a dull moment – I just wish the story as a whole was more sophisticated than Jesse simply chasing down some bad people for revenge. Over the course of Evil West you’ll gradually unlock new weapons, powers, and upgrades that alter Jesse’s abilities in fun new ways. For example, you can increase the number of shots your pistol gets off in a single magazine, augment your rifle with electrical damage, and even incorporate new abilities like ground pounds and aerial combos to continue evolving your arsenal. The way combat is always expanding helps break up the otherwise monotonous layouts of Evil West’s levels. There is rarely a stretch of time longer than 20 minutes in which you won’t either unlock a new ability, augment an existing weapon with a fresh effect, or find an entirely new gadget for dismembering enemies in glorious ways. During the review period, Evil West was still rated as “Unsupported” on Steam Deck, but that’s likely because it just hadn’t released and been certified yet. While I primarily played on my desktop PC, I found I vastly preferred using a gamepad over a mouse and keyboard. The UI is clearly designed to reflect a controller layout for quick reference and some commands, like pulling enemies towards you with the electric gauntlet, feel awkward on a keyboard. To that end, I decided to install it on my Steam Deck (I’m using the 512GB model) and give it a try anyway. You have to use the touchscreen or touchpad to install some Unreal Engine supporting files on first launch, but after that it ran great. It’s already optimized for controller support so all of the UI switched over to gamepad prompts immediately. Performance was a bit all over the place at first. Frames dipped down to the low 20s on Epic or High settings, but after turning off motion blur (yuck), leaving on V-Sync, and lowering to Medium settings it was much better, hovering around 40-60 frames-per-second. Ultimately, I opted for setting a 40 FPS frame limit in the Steam Deck’s performance setting menu to get the most consistent performance. That wasn’t so bad, though my RTX 2060 Super desktop PC was able to play smoothly at 60 fps with no stutters on High settings the vast majority of the time. In addition to that constant evolution, combat has a frantic flow that feels great in motion. You can zoom across the map and stun enemies then rack up a melee combo, uppercut them into the air, and jump up to smash them back down into a pool of blood and guts. Or you can charge up your rifle with a high-powered beam of electricity that ricochets between enemies before unleashing your flamethrower to finish them off. It’s a ludicrous selection of weaponry that’s easy to switch between on the fly since nearly every piece of gear has its own dedicated button and cooldown timer – no ammo or bullets to keep track of. You can just wait for stuff to recharge while using something else. The one part of the combat that did grow a bit dull by the end of Evil West was the lack of enemy variety. Slow-moving zombies with heavy wind up swings never pose a challenge and even the most aggressive hulking monstrosities wielding shields lack oomph after the first few fights. It can even be difficult to tell what’s going on during the most chaotic battles because every enemy bleeds together (pun intended) and they all end up looking like the same tones of blood and mud. (It doesn’t help that the notification arrow to let you know someone is attacking is relatively subtle and easy to miss in the thick of things.) Enemy reuse is particularly noticeable when it comes to larger health sponge enemies too, as Evil West likes to copy-paste baddies that were once bosses into later levels as mini bosses. Sometimes these enemies even attack in packs on subsequent meetings, which is pure chaos and, admittedly, a true symphony of violence. But since every combat encounter is basically just a circular arena you dodge and strafe around as you fight, that gaggle of large health bars could wear my patience thin after a while. With no jump button or variety in how combat encounters are laid out, every fight ends up feeling like the same mushy puddle of goo even with the creative arsenal at your disposal. That doesn’t mean hopping around in that goo (gross) wasn’t fun, it just means this is simply the kind of game you boot up when you don’t want to think. It’s repetitive, predictable, and unoriginal in a lot of ways, but I found myself not caring because I was enjoying killing monsters so much anyway. In that regard, Evil West shares a lot of the same DNA as Flying Wild Hog’s previous chaotic action romp, Shadow Warrior 3, even if the genre is entirely different – both games double down on what matters most to obfuscate plenty of other areas that are lacking. Evil West is a refreshing blast from the past that nails the most important parts of its old-school, vampire-hunting action. The combat is smooth and its weapon options are ludicrously entertaining, but low enemy variety and overly similar level layouts can grow somewhat monotonous after a while. This is far from being the most complex or innovative action game I’ve played, but every so often you just want to have some fun smashing in monster skulls. "
97,Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 Review in Progress,8.0,"Two years after the original Call of Duty: Warzone dropped into the battle royale arena, its sequel, Warzone 2.0, has arrived with a new map and some enticing new game modes. Or at least, it would offer those things if network and server issues weren’t preventing me from playing a single full, clean match since its launch on Wednesday. That could just be the typical release window woes, and I’ll be holding off on my full scored review until things have had a chance to settle and I’ve played more, but anyone looking to dive in over the weekend should be prepared for a bumpy landing. Warzone 2.0 is still a battle royale at its center, bringing back a lot of the first game’s mechanics and base features while introducing a few tweaks of its own, like having two or three smaller circles that eventually converge into one. It’s not all familiar though, as the brand new Al Mazrah map nicely incorporates some of the multiplayer stages from Modern Warfare 2, and the new DMZ mode that takes place on it provides a welcome change of pace from Warzone’s usual last person standing structure.  But while these additions are intriguing to me, I’ve only been able to play a handful of matches on PC where the performance was what I would describe as “almost decent” – and even then I’d face a lot of microstutters and latency issues that kept Warzone 2.0 from feeling smooth. Some people are reportedly having fewer problems than others, but my game would randomly spike to 999 millisecond latency and glue my feet to the ground for a minute so I was unable to move, sometimes making survival during fights near impossible. Somewhat surprisingly, DMZ was the only game mode I could play consistently without having disconnection issues, but even that had latency spikes during matches. DMZ is the new loot and extract sandbox mode, no doubt inspired by the success of games like Escape from Tarkov, and it’s actually really fun and refreshing to play between battle royale matches. Being able to fight big groups of NPCs and infiltrate strongholds with my teammate while also keeping an eye on potential enemy players running toward us was exciting. It kept me on my toes in a different way from the usual battle royale mode, and made me want to jump back into the Al Mazrah map to get more loot and keys to unlock strongholds again and again. That appeal could partially be because the battle royale mode itself is currently the most frustrating one to try and play. Matches contain the same whopping cap of up to 150 players total in each mode: Solos, Duos, Trios, or Quads. However, a lot of the time my lobbies wouldn’t fill up enough to launch, so people would get impatient and leave before they did. That meant most of my time trying to play a battle royale match became a never ending cycle of queueing and requeueing to find a server that would fire. When I could enter a match, I was at least able to get a feel for how the mode plays. It’s largely a lot of the same from the original, but that was already a very fun battle royale with solid looting and shooting mechanics that only improved over time. One interesting new addition here is that you can actually recruit enemy players to your team in squad-based lobbies if you end up losing a teammate at any point. This is a clever way to give weakened teams or solo stragglers a fighting chance and keep more people invested in a match for longer. It’s also just fun to make friends in a Battle Royale, which is a bit unexpected in such a cutthroat format. The Unhinged Trios mode even lets you invite up to six people to be on your team mid-match, living up to its “unhinged” descriptor in the chaos that creates. I’m still early in my time with it, but so far Warzone 2.0 seems like a fun evolution of its predecessor whenever I’m able to get into a decently stable server and actually play something close to a full match. I already feel the pull of the new DMZ mode in particular, but I just haven’t been able to play enough yet to find out if that feeling will last. I have had more disconnects and latency issues than any actual game time, with release instability still persisting as we head into the weekend. Hopefully Warzone 2.0’s servers and desync issues can be resolved soon so I can, you know, actually play more of it, and I’ll be back with my final scored review in the next week or two. Building on the already rock-solid foundation of the original Warzone, Warzone 2.0 is a positive update to Call of Duty’s battle royale mode, even with few drawbacks of its own. Its new map isn’t the most exciting outside of being the biggest ever brought to Warzone, but great additions like proximity chat and an updated ping system change things up and bring new life to the struggle for survival. And while adding backpacks as lootable gear may have slowed down looting in general, the new take on the Gulag creates some memorable moments if you can convince your fellow prisoners to team up against a common enemy for the greater good. And, as an added bonus, the new DMZ extraction mode revitalizes Warzone by appealing to people who might not want to sweat through full battle royale matches every time, but still want to level weapons and get a quick taste of that fight for survival. "
98,Pokémon Scarlet and Violet Review in Progress,6.0,"Before I started Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, I didn’t quite believe they would actually let me wander off in any old direction like developer Game Freak claimed I could. Even with the increasingly open nature of recent Pokémon games like Sword, Shield, and Arceus, this has still been a very linear RPG series, with a set path of challenges and plot points lined up in a neat order. But then I picked up my Fuecoco and ventured out into the Paldea region only to have that disbelief completely shattered. After a few years of experimentation on the Switch, Game Freak has finally stumbled upon an open world formula that successfully reinvents how Pokémon is played, while remaining true to the nostalgic childhood vision of exploration, adventure, and cute monster collecting. It is, in almost every way, the transformation I’ve been waiting for – but the grievously poor performance that has come along with it significantly mars this otherwise exciting design evolution. After a fairly beefy opening route and some exposition about going to school to become good at Pokémon , you are given three major story paths to follow, each with several objectives you can choose to tackle in any order. It’s not unlike The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild’s structure of opening all four Divine Beasts at once – and similar to heading straight for Hyrule Castle to fight Ganon, you can (as far as I can tell) walk out of your school and run straight to the hardest gym and challenge it, though I wouldn’t actually recommend doing that.  The review embargo for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet has lifted, and while I’ve finished the main story, we’re opting to hold our final, scored review until after launch for a few reasons. First and foremost is that the online features were not available to test ahead of release. While this has been the case for most Pokémon reviews, online has historically been limited to simple things like trading and battling. But with Scarlet and Violet, the ability to simultaneously explore its enormous open world with up to three other players was advertised as one of its new key features. Without online turned on, I don’t know exactly what kinds of things players can do together in that mode, much less how it runs or if it’s any fun. Scoring Scarlet and Violet without testing it out personally would be a considerable omission, so we’re opting to wait until we’ve had a few days with it post-launch to make a final call. In addition to this, the review embargo we agreed to in order to receive early code from Nintendo was strict, and included limitations on what Pokémon we could show in our video review (including not allowing us to show a Pokémon that appears quite commonly on the very first route!). It also restricts us from telling you how long it took to finish the story, a critical piece of information that we endeavor to include in all of our reviews. Given all that, plus the limited amount of time we’ve had with Scarlet and Violet (code arrived less than a week before the embargo lifted), we decided it was best to take a bit more time so we could share our full, unrestricted thoughts in a scored review next week. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet do not include level scaling, so you’ll get destroyed immediately unless you follow the “intended” paths at least a little bit more closely. However, if you do try to take on objectives in precise order of difficulty, you’ll have to do a lot of inconvenient zigging and zagging across the massive Paldea map. What Scarlet and Violet actually seem to promote instead, and what I enjoyed so much about them, was getting gloriously lost. My journey involved accidentally walking into a slightly-too-difficult area early on, but using strategy and care to power through anyway. The first half or so of my adventure was incredibly difficult and rewarding as a result. When I went to work through the areas I had missed, I steamrolled several in a row before I caught up to more level-appropriate challenges again. While I’m not wild about taking on a gym full of level 15 Pokémon with a team of level 35s, the inconsistent difficulty not only evened out by the endgame, it also didn’t detract from my enjoyment much. That’s partially because Scarlet and Violet’s three story paths are all fairly involved and interesting on their own merits (especially compared to the weirdly truncated stories of Sword, Shield, and Arceus), but it’s also because exploring the enormous world was its own delight. Game Freak has taken another big step in the right direction with Scarlet and Violet in making a believable, creature-filled wilderness with a Regional Pokedex bulky enough that I didn’t miss all the National Dex Pokemon it excludes. When I reached areas I was well overleveled for, I still had a great time hunting for items and using the autobattler Let’s Go mode to train up some weaker monsters – or to barrel through a herd of Mudbray. What’s more, the wild behaviors and animations of Pokémon have been improved too. Magikarp swim up to the shoreline only to wash up and flop uselessly on the beach, clusters of Psyduck curiously gather to watch you battle, and Klawf dive bomb you from their perches on cliff faces. While Sword and Shield’s Wild Area looked more like someone spilled a bag of random Pokémon everywhere at times, Scarlet and Violet have monsters traveling believably in herds, clustering around a water’s edge, or hiding up trees more akin to real animals. It was hard to stop myself from spending hours poking around Paldea’s massive “areas” (the far more open evolution of past games’ “routes”) for all the monsters hiding there so I could finish this review. Aside from its phenomenal shift to a true open world, I’ve had one other major takeaway from my time with Pokémon Scarlet and Violet so far that is impossible to ignore: they are a technical mess. In fact, there really isn’t a moment in these games where I’d say they run well. The framerate is all over the place, dipping agonizingly low even when only a few effects such as flowing water or weather are on screen. Character models only a few feet away pop in and out, sometimes rapidly, or chug along at stop motion animation speeds. Everything has a weird, shimmery blur to it, and shadows frequently disappear and reappear suddenly and illogically. Pokémon clip in and out of walls or floors at odd angles, or get stuck in them entirely – I spent an entire Gym Battle with one Pokemon halfway buried in the floor. The camera will occasionally clip through mountainsides and give a full view of a video gamey void, sometimes ruining cool moments (like, for instance, the evolution of my Wooper). Everything lags all the time, from battles to menus to cutscenes. Two of our guides writers have experienced hard game crashes. It is, by far, the worst-running Pokémon game I have ever played, and among the worst-running AAA games I’ve played on the Switch so far. And yes, this is with the day one patch. What’s saddest is that these issues frequently detract from what would otherwise be Scarlet and Violet’s most brilliant, standout moments. It is incredible to be able to stand on top of a huge snowy mountain at the center of a Pokémon region and see a dazzling light show of a gym in the distance one way, a sparkling lake in another, and a towering red mesa in another still, and know that I can go to all three of those places without a single loading screen, simply by taking a leap. A seamless, open Pokémon world we can explore however we like is a dream come true for Pokémon lovers, and for a brief moment I thought I’d be able to put aside all the technical nonsense and just enjoy the plethora of good design choices I’d been waiting for. But the issues are constant, and interrupt almost every moment intended to be spectacular or emotional or fun. For instance, the Paldea region’s biggest and most beautifully designed city where several major story moments play out is one of the most technically janky areas of all. Heck, it’s impossible to simply run around any given grassy field for a minute or two and not be caught off guard by Pokémon models popping in and out or everything suddenly lagging dramatically. And that’s all offline – what happens to it on launch day when I go online with three friends in these already laggy areas? I desperately hope some early patches can clean this mess up and bring it (I can’t believe I’m saying this) more in line with Arceus or Sword and Shield – those games had their technical issues, but they were much more forgivable by comparison. Because Scarlet and Violet are a blast to play, and aside from a few quibbles about the precise way certain systems work, Game Freak largely seems to have figured out what kind of open world design works for the series. It truly delivers on the Pokémon fantasy while embracing a more modern RPG style. Even as I cringed watching NPCs weirdly skate down giant staircases and vanish halfway, I was reveling in Scarlet and Violet’s fantastic story, characters, monsters, and world. I want more Pokémon games that play like this, just not ones that run like this. I am still looking forward to spending a lot more time in Paldea before finalizing my review and putting a score on it next week – especially as I see how the online multiplayer works once it goes live. I just wish this region was the beautiful, expansive, Pokémon-stuffed Paldea the artists and designers clearly envisioned and tried to present to me, and not the slow-moving, muddled, oddly-lit Paldea I’ve been chugging my way through for the last week. Rebekah Valentine is a news reporter for IGN. You can find her on Twitter @duckvalentine. I’ve been tearing my hair out for two weeks now over how conflicted I feel about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. The thing is, discovering and catching all these charming monsters across an enormous open world with an actually good story is really fun… it just comes with far, far too many asterisks. I truly believe that the bold new ideas of Scarlet and Violet are fantastic, if unrefined – a belief I also held about Pokémon Legends: Arceus. But in both cases, so many of the pillars holding up those shining concepts – visual quality, open-world details, customization, and technical soundness – are seemingly unfinished or actively crumbling. It is completely impossible to play Scarlet and Violet and not notice at least some of its performance issues. Every minute I was happily running around the grassy fields of Paldea I was also actively cringing at a Pokémon stuck in the floor, wincing at some weird framerate nonsense going on with a nearby wild Pokémon, or groaning at another bout of crippling lag. And the promising online co-op play that could be the start of an exciting new era for the series makes all these problems significantly worse. As a decades-long fan, I desperately want better for Pokémon, especially given how clear it is that the design fundamentals are absolutely there under the surface. But if you’re devoted to this series, as so many are, know that the proper care we’ve all come to expect has not been shown here. "
99,Goat Simulator 3 ,8.0,"I don’t know if I’ve ever played something as gobsmackingly unhinged as Goat Simulator 3. Developer Coffee Stain North’s doggedly rebellious attitude is apparent in everything from the incoherent “story” to gameplay so over-the-top that half the time it’s hard to tell what’s happening – even the title refuses to play by the rules, skipping Goat Simulator 2 and going straight to three for no particular reason. Throw in four-player co-op that multiplies the madness to even greater extremes as you run rampant through a large open-world map filled with things to lick, headbutt, and blow up, and you’ve got yourself a game so absurd it’s hard to imagine being bored for even a second. This deranged sequel is bigger, packed with silly jokes and pop culture references, and one of stupidest things I have ever beheld. It was love at first bleat. Like the original, Goat Simulator 3 is an open-world sandbox game that doesn’t even bother with things like a tutorial or having any kind of direction with its ridiculous plot (if you can even call it that). . Instead it lets you and your friends loose on the world and says “go ahead – break it all,” as you complete a series of non sequitur quests and feats of mayhem. You’ll do normal goat stuff like drop a nuclear bomb on a cul-de-sac, or cause a trio of ballerinas to turn into a giant tornado that never goes away for the rest of your adventure, or drive cars into your friends until they explode (both the cars and the friends). However, unlike the first Goat Simulator, this time you are given clear objectives and a quest log that guides you towards leveling up your Illuminati Ranks, upgrading your Goat Castle base, and eventually reaching an incredibly bonkers conclusion after roughly eight hours. The quests are about as insane as you’d expect: in one I was elected President after dragging citizens kicking and screaming into a voting booth with my tongue, while in another I had to infiltrate a facility to unleash a race of anthropomorphic bananas on the world. Oh, and in another, I literally just went bird watching. I really never knew what they were going to throw at me at any given moment, which was delightful.  ""Goat Simulator isn’t much of a game, but it’s a hell of a good time. The small but dense map is packed with tons of jokes and bugs that should be seen rather than talked about, and there’s at least a few hours’ worth of entertainment in goofing around with the jetpack alone. It’s a clever interactive spoof of all the broken game physics we’ve seen in open worlds – almost like a greatest hits album of all the ridiculous bugs that pop up in serious games like Skyrim or Assassin’s Creed, except embraced and celebrated in a world that’s made to be broken. There’s no health bar and you can’t actually be killed by anything, so there are practically never consequences for anything you do, which can be both a good thing and a bad thing. On the one hand, you can throw yourself at problems with reckless abandon, free from worry that you’ll ever fail at anything – but on the other hand, it also removes any potential challenge, which means you’ll blow through any obstacle before you with relative ease. Instead, the fun comes from inventing creative ways to get things done, like that time I transformed myself into a tiny fish to avoid a security system and pull off a heist. You’ll also complete a list of less important challenges called Instincts that might ask you to get arrested by the police a certain number of times, or light people on fire, or drive a car up a ramp just for the heck of it – all of which make for good, chaotic diversions. You can also search for collectibles out in the world, which are often hidden in places that require jumping off rooftops or some such silliness. That said, you’re given so many insane and overpowered tools it's very easy to find workarounds, like using expandable stilts to simply raise yourself up to something’s level. Once you figure that out, gathering collectibles just becomes a simple scavenger hunt with no challenge to it either. Instincts and collectibles don’t help you increase your Illuminati Ranks or complete the campaign, but they do let you earn some extra Goat Points to buy cosmetics. Some of those even have an impact on gameplay, like a rocket launcher you can wear on your back or butterfly wings that let you glide through the air. Alternatively, you could just buy a skin called Tony Shark that swaps out your goat body for a shark riding a skateboard – whatever floats your goat. One massive improvement over its predecessor is that Goat Simulator 3’s world is significantly larger and even more packed with secrets and chance encounters. Areas include a spooky cemetery filled with ghosts, a large city with skyscrapers to climb, and a wooded area, each of which has their own vibe and list of loopy things to discover. In one hidden area, I played an almost beat-for-beat recreation of the P.T. demo called Horror Corridor, except with dumb goat goodness instead of a creepy lady. Finding these super weird encounters and Easter eggs is easily the best part of this bizarre sandbox, and often left me in stitches. While Goat Simulator 3 is entertaining enough on its own, the true potential of this big island filled with ridiculousness is opened up when you share it with friends. Not only can you play four-player co-op online, but you’re also able to do so via local splitscreen, and I don’t know if any game has felt more suited for a couch filled with the degenerates I call friends than this one. Causing mayhem with my buddies not only amplifies the chaos with up to four times the number of goat psychos running around, but you can also make progress four times as fast since everyone can tackle missions on completely different parts of the map without issue. Although, more often than not my group just griefed one another instead of being productive. There are also half a dozen competitive minigames, like King of the Hill or The Floor is Lava, which make for some amusing distractions to pass the time, though they’re all pretty basic and lose their allure once you’ve played them a few times – running around the open-world and headbutting cop cars is just way more fun. Really the only major shortcoming of Goat Simulator 3 is that it’s got bugs and poor performance, though honestly even those issues can feel right at home in a sandbox this chaotic. I found my way into objects I wasn’t supposed to get stuck in, rocked the framerate to terrifyingly low levels during moments of especially potent mayhem, and more. Plus, there’s lots of ugly pop-in that makes things seem a bit unpolished in a way that doesn’t feel like part of the joke. These issues were especially bad when playing in splitscreen, where an abundance of goats tested the limits of the world’s stability, but none of them did much to ruin the experience overall. Goat Simulator 3 is the evolution in idiocy I’d hoped for from this iconically weird series. It almost certainly won’t wow you with its level of polish or a deep, meaningful narrative, but sometimes it’s a good idea to turn your brain off and buck your hooves into an old lady’s face while she fires a rocket launcher at you. With a larger map, more ridiculous references and hilarious jokes, and multiplayer that only enhances the ludicrous good times, I can easily recommend this to anyone with a taste for its silly sense of humor and a few hours to kill. "
100,Somerville ,7.0,"Somerville is a delightfully bizarre, physics-based puzzle adventure game that was developed by some of the former talent that created Playdead’s pair of modern classics: Limbo and Inside. And yet at the same time it plays very differently from those offerings, reminding me more of the seminal early-’90s classic Out of This World than Limbo or Inside with its upside-down setting, its color palette and character renderings, and its ever-rotating camera orientation from scene to scene. This was a pleasant surprise, though it isn’t nearly as polished or thought-provoking as its progenitors, leaving us with a very good game but ultimately not one I expect to be thinking about for very long now that I’ve finished it. Somerville opens in the most wholesome way possible: A man, a woman, their infant child, and their dog are all on the living room couch, having fallen asleep in front of the TV. You take control of the man, who is never named. In fact, we never hear from him or from anyone else. Like Limbo, Inside, and Out of This World, there is no dialogue; Somerville’s storytelling is entirely visual. And visually, I do love what developer Jumpship has done here. Our nameless, voiceless hero is also essentially faceless, since all of these characters are more like impressionist renderings of people. And yet the use of color – and particularly contrast – makes the world pop when need be, such as when a dash of yellow wordlessly tells you that you can interact with an object.  Sound design, meanwhile, is effective in its minimalism. Aside from the piano soundtrack that’s good at nudging up the drama or tension when Somerville’s designers want it to, the pervading audio you’ll hear is the pained breathing and movement of our hero. Whatever happened to him clearly physically hurts him, and the further into this strange new world he gets, the more pain he’s in. All of this paints a very dark, bleak, and yet intriguing mystery – one where the story wastes no time in ratcheting up the danger with extraterrestrial objects suddenly filling the sky outside of your remote cabin in the opening moments and, well, it only gets mesmerizingly weirder from there. Somerville, then, is a slightly-under-four-hour quest to unravel what the hell just happened and is very much still happening. You’ll need to solve physics-based puzzles using your inexplicably glowing arm’s newfound power – primarily through turning the invading alien architecture into a permeable, water-like substance by shining light on it; specifically, light that’s been supercharged by your arm’s power. Extra layers get added to these powers as you progress, but it’s a bit thin; while it was enough gameplay to keep Somerville out of walking simulator territory, its puzzles aren’t likely to hold you up for more than a few moments at a time. In fact, the one time I did get hung up, it was more of an issue I had wrestling with the physics system than the actual game design. Part of the reason its puzzles never get all that complex is that Somerville keeps its control scheme minimalist: the triggers and one face button are all you’ll ever need. I admire that simplicity – including in the way it keeps its interface nonexistent 99% of the time. Especially in a moody adventure like this, I love when the atmospheric world gets to shine through unobstructed. As a dog lover I was delighted at first by the prospect of having a four-legged wingman, but sadly, your canine companion serves almost no purpose here aside from occasionally and subtly pointing you in the right direction. He doesn’t assist in puzzles or gameplay, he has no impact on the story, and you can’t even pet him at will. There’s value in some companionship in such a lonely world, but it seems like he could’ve been given something more to do. Lonely and isolating as it may be, the altered Earth is, again, pretty. It’s also refreshing to be able to move about freely in each scene’s 3D space, which Somerville mixes up constantly. This is not a left-to-right stage progression; you’ll go up, down, left, and right at various times, and in that respect Somerville does a great job of staving off anything remotely resembling monotony during its short run. That’s a big part of where the aforementioned Out of This World reminder stems from, which was very much a good thing. And like that gem, I was always intrigued by where Somerville’s next scene might take me. Occasionally, though, that freedom results in awkward transitions when you move from one room to the next. Sometimes the room you’re heading into will have a different camera angle that causes you to move in the opposite direction, right back where you just came from, which never ceases to be annoying. When I made it through, though, I found a conclusion to the story that left me with far more questions than answers as I watched the end credits roll, and I have to admit with some disappointment that I didn’t immediately feel compelled to gather around the nearest water cooler to discuss those questions with friends. It’s difficult to describe without spoiling anything, but I suppose I’d say that I didn’t find Somerville’s mystery as alluring as I’d hoped. Somerville follows its own unique path within the puzzle-adventure genre. That path isn’t always a smooth one, with camera annoyances and physics wonkiness occasionally serving as a pebble in your shoe while solving its series of pleasantly challenging puzzles, and the story is more strange for the sake of being strange than it is thought-provoking. But thanks to its strong visual storytelling techniques and the way the opening minutes inspire an irresistible desire to find out what happened to this man and whether or not he’ll ever find his family, Somerville is nevertheless a very good tour through an exceptionally bleak scenario – all of which is successfully conveyed without a single line of dialogue. "
101,Pentiment ,10.0,"It's been an age since I felt so captivated by such a simple adventure game as Pentiment. A rousing, steadily-paced detective thriller set in the Late Medieval Bavarian countryside, the storybook art style inspired by colorful manuscripts of the era is downright enthralling. While the gameplay basically consists of looking around for clues, questioning townsfolk, and trying to draw your own conclusions about the evidence you find, that minimalist approach works excellently for the rich and complex story Pentiment tells. Our inquisitive lead is Andeas Maler, initially an idealistic aspiring artist who comes to the picturesque, rustic town of Tassing to further his career in the nearby abbey's scriptorium. He quickly becomes embroiled in a macabre conspiracy that delves into the town's shrouded past, enticing you to uncover secrets many would rather keep buried. You get to define a lot of elements of Andreas' backstory, such as where and what he studied, which I really enjoyed and adds an element of replayability. Having a university degree in theology helped a lot when pesky monks and nuns tried to quote the Bible at me to get their way and I was able to do so right back. But my background choices didn't open up new paths quite as much as I would have liked, with their impact on a conversation most often boiling down to some different options for flavor text.  Thankfully, there aren't many unintuitive puzzles in the traditional adventure game sense where you have to find bits and bobs out in the world and combine them to make a key. So the challenge of each mystery is talking to the right people, convincing them to tell you what you know, checking their story against others you've heard, and perhaps most importantly, using your time wisely. When you commit to pursuing a particular lead, time will advance, and you're never given enough time to pursue them all. This added some welcome tension and forced me to make a lot of interesting decisions. I look forward to going back and finding out what I missed on future playthroughs. The town of Tassing and its surroundings are brought to life with a cohesive, beautiful, somewhat minimalist art style that takes inspiration from the very same period-accurate illustrations Andreas himself is working on. Sprawling fields, magnificent churches, and even secret crypts radiate color, life, and personality. Even the text boxes feature a variety of beautiful scripts that vary based on a person's social class, with flowing handwriting for peasants and sanctimonious blackletter script for members of the church. The sound design is excellent, as well. The ambience of the village square or the relative quiet of a monastery during prayer is subtle, but highly effective at conveying a sense of place. And I'm not normally one for the whole ASMR thing, but there's something about that noise of a pen scratching across vellum when characters are talking that gives me goosebumps. I feel like I could listen to it all day. The soundtrack, likewise, transported me to the Middle Ages with its traditional melodies and period-accurate instruments. The whole production really feels like a love letter from some serious Medieval history fans to all the like-minded players such as myself. Debating the writings of Christine de Pizan, discovering a certain character's entanglements with the Fugger Bank, or even having a ""What would Socrates do?"" option in certain dialogues might be lost on many, but they made me grin with joy. Far from a pop culture caricature, it's very clear that developer Obsidian Entertainment did a lot of research into the daily lives, theology, and sociology of the Holy Roman Empire in the 1500s. I practically gasped when I realized a folktale told by some of the townsfolk was a bastardization of a battle that took place near here during the Roman era. Every step of the way, I felt like I was geeking out about one of my special interests alongside the writers and artists. The dialogue and character writing are exceptional and effective, as well. Andreas himself is a complex character who changes significantly across the snapshots of his life we get to join him on. Pentiment's world is one of heartbreaking personal tragedy, complex moral dilemmas, harrowing secrets, and the search for a purpose, with a huge cast of memorable characters who evolve alongside the town – partly based on decisions you get to make. And none of those decisions are easy. I never hit a point where I knew exactly what had happened, who was to blame, and that they definitely deserved to be punished by the proper authorities. Often, the best you can do is to decide on what course of action is the least of several evils. I also really enjoyed how snappy and fast-paced the dialogue is. It's very easy for this type of game to be verbose and overwhelming. You only need to look to Obsidian's own Pillars of Eternity games for an example of how dumping way too much text on players at once can throw a wet blanket on a swashbuckling adventure. Pentiment wisely gets away from that tendency, with flavorful back-and-forths in which each character only speaks a sentence or two at a time. Journal entries about important people and world concepts are also tactfully brief. You're never expected to spend several minutes reading to understand what's going on. As an engrossing 15 to 20-hour adventure game, a chronicle of a small town and its people in turbulent times, a reverent celebration of the finer details of Late Medieval history, and a clever detective story in which straight answers are hard to come by – Pentiment is a clear champion. My gripes about it are all relatively minor, and I look forward to playing it at least once or twice more to explore roads not taken. It never suffers for its simplicity, lacking in combat or traditional puzzles, because of how effectively it tangled me up in the complexities of its gorgeously-realized world and made me want to learn all I could about its people and its past. There isn't much more to say about Pentiment, other than I can hardly recommend it highly enough. "
102,Sonic Frontiers ,7.0,"Sonic Frontiers doesn’t limit you to a small, carefully curated prix fixe menu of things to try. Instead, it takes the all-you-can-eat buffet approach, throwing new ideas at you from start to finish, without really seeming to care if they’re fresh and appetizing or looking wilted and limp under the heat lamp. When I jumped off the starting line of this sprint across Sonic’s first open-world game I certainly didn’t expect to play jump rope, duke it out with a giant robot, watch a dramatic origin story for an extinct race of beings, or do a heck of a lot of fishing, but Frontiers kept me guessing even late into the campaign with what it would try next. Even when some of those ideas didn’t work, I was almost always glad that Sega gave it the old college try, and as a result I rarely found myself bored. I did find myself feeling blue because of the absurd amount of pop-in that happens every time this famously fast character does his thing, but Sonic Frontiers is, for the most part, a promising first attempt at blazing a new trail for the series. While you’re working your way through Frontiers’ chain of five Starfall Islands over the course of about 20 hours total, you’ll uncover the dark and extremely predictable backstory of a long-extinct race while hanging out with Sonic-family favorites like Amy and Knuckles. You’ll also meet a strange new enemy named Sage and learn what her deal is in the most agonizingly slow way possible, since her main hobbies appear to be dodging pointed questions and speaking exclusively in vagaries.  With all of the different plot threads Frontiers juggles, they do end up feeling oddly disconnected from each other and none of them offer a ton of surprises between their ungodly number of cliches concerning the power of friendship and ancient civilizations wielding advanced technology. But they do leave room for some really good moments between the furry cast of characters – in fact, Frontiers produces some of the most in-depth characterizations of the Sonic cast we’ve ever seen in a game. One part of the campaign hones in on the brotherly rivalry between Sonic and Knuckles, while another does a great job at building Tails up as more than just Sonic’s sidekick. All of that more than sated my ravenous appetite for Sonic’s usual anime-style nonsense in between all of the fancy robot kicking and rolling around at the speed of sound. Sprinting around the sprawling open-world areas is, as you’d hope, one of the best parts of this open-world odyssey. The islands you dash about on are suitably large playgrounds for you to test the limits of your roadrunning, so long as you don’t fall into water or lava that immediately kills you. My personal favorite new trick, though, is the Cyloop – it lets you draw a circle while blazing a trail to create a tornado of death that impacts everything caught within it. This ability can be used and abused to do damage in combat, solve puzzles, and even farm rings since it generates a few every time. Plus, literally running circles around your enemies is just an incredibly Sonic thing to do, which is why I practically never stopped doing it throughout my playthrough. And since it lets you turn running into a deadly weapon, it makes speeding around the map all the more entertaining. The only thing that’s a little disappointing about whizzing around is that, unless you’re getting the speed boost that comes with being maxed out of rings, you don’t run quite as fast as you might hope. That can be improved a fair bit by leveling up your speed stat over the course of the campaign, but I still would have preferred the default starting speed be a little more Roadrunner and a little less hungover hedgehog. What becomes clear after a few laps around the first island is that Sonic Frontiers is an action-adventure game that joins a growing pack of old-school series looking to reimagine themselves as open-world sandboxes – and in this particular case it mostly works out. Just like Pokémon Legends: Arceus and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain before it, Frontiers keeps a lot of what makes the Sonic series beloved and unique (including some fun homages) but also throws in big areas to explore and fills them with a wild assortment of side distractions and mostly interesting new ideas. Not all of those activities are created equal, but it works overall just because of the sheer variety. One moment you’re juggling robots like you’re playing Baby’s First Devil May Cry, the next you’re trying to beat a time trial in a 2D platforming stage, and a minute after that you’re playing a game of pinball inside of an active volcano. You’ll grind some truly epic rails, solve extremely simple puzzles, do some puzzle-platforming, and of course, catch some fish – because if you can’t fish, does it even count as an open-world game? There were moments where I saw glimpses of genius in this bizarre hodgepodge of activities. Sections called Cyber Space levels smartly break up the open world by teleporting you into bite-sized, traditionally linear Sonic levels where you’re racing the clock and collecting rings as you make a mad dash for the goal line. On the other hand, one of the big things Frontiers tries that doesn’t work well is combat. You’re just mashing buttons to pull off simple combos and knock the snot out of faceless robotic enemies. I appreciated the occasional break from platforming, but since it never proves to be a challenge and throws you into almost identical fights again and again, I soon came to resent being yanked out of my lightning-speed racing just to smack down another bunch of dumb toaster-looking fools. It’s especially annoying when it comes to the minibosses roaming the open world, who often dragged me into unskippable fight sequences that weren’t particularly challenging or interesting, especially when I ran into them multiple times. The groan of irritation at the prospect of repeating the same encounter a third or fourth time was impossible to contain. The larger goal of each zone is to collect Chaos Emeralds to power you up for a big, over-the-top boss fight, but it’s not as straightforward as it sounds. In order to find all those delicious gems you’ll have to first collect portal gears out in the world, use those gears to open portals that lead to Cyber Space levels where you can collect vault keys, then finally use those vault keys to unlock the emeralds. If that sounds at all confusing to you, it’s because it definitely can be – but by the time I completed my first island or two, I felt completely comfortable with all the different weird currencies and collectibles on my checklist. The big boss fights at the end of each island fare a bit better than the regular combat too, especially when you go full Sonic Saiyan and take on a giant, evil robot. Sometimes they’re a little awkward because of repeated animations and weird camera issues where the boss boops you outside of the arena and knocks you into a frustrating viewing angle, but flying around as an invincible rodent god and pulling off sweet butt-kicking moves makes collecting all those Chaos Emeralds worth the effort. I also really enjoyed how the perspective will automatically shift between 2D and 3D when you’re out in the open world, depending on the activity you’re engaging with. If I was grinding a rail and entered an area that required platforming, it would switch me to a 2D perspective so I could zip around like it was 1991, but when I got into a fight a moment later it would switch back to three dimensions so I could run literal circles around the enemy. The only issue is that occasionally I’d accidentally step on a spring or a rail while running around the island and find myself trapped in 2D, which was sometimes hard to get out of. It’s a bit like stubbing your toe on a board game, then having to complete a full playthrough of Chutes and Ladders before getting to go back about your business. There are other things Frontiers has you do, like solving very easy puzzles that range from mildly amusing minigames to completely braindead chores, or dipping your toes into RPG mechanics by gathering collectibles to raise your stats. These aren’t terrible additions, but they also don’t feel like they’re fully fleshed out. The upgrades in particular are a bit odd since they do things like let you carry more rings or increase your attack and defense stats by such minor amounts that they barely have an impact on gameplay. It’s almost like the developers shrugged and said “Sure, why not?” and threw a half-baked first draft of every idea they could come up with into the mix just for the heck of it. It’s also kind of insane how much progression can be earned through the fishing minigame, especially since it’s only mildly amusing for a few minutes before it starts feeling like an errand. But I can’t argue that it’s not worth my while; without even trying I quickly found it could be farmed for an enormous amount of resources that are much more difficult to acquire out in the open world. On one island, I fished with my boy Big the Cat for half an hour and gained so many portal gears, vault keys, and memory tokens that I could have chosen to bypass an enormous chunk of platforming, exploration, and combat. I was also able to level up my character over 60 times in a matter of minutes using this method, which just felt… wrong. It would be one thing if Sonic had a canonical love of seafood or something, but this is ridiculous. The biggest shortcoming with this new open-world design, though, has nothing to do with the buffet of mostly amusing activities – it’s simply that Frontiers is not at all able to keep up with Sonic’s godlike speed on a technical level. My immersion was broken about every five seconds when large objects, like a section of a floating loop-de-loop or a huge tree, popped into view right in front of me. Granted, that’s sometimes hilarious but it’s always jarring and just plain ugly. Most of the time it’s a railing or platform that blips into existence a couple feet away from you, but sometimes it’s entire areas of the world. For all of its amazing quick-loading capabilities, the PS5 just couldn’t seem to handle how hilariously fast Frontiers let me go. Whether I was playing in the 4K resolution mode at 30fps or the much more desirable 60fps mode (seriously, what are we even doing here playing a game this fast at any less?), the pop-in was always an issue. In one case I even ran so fast the ground hadn’t loaded yet and I fell through the map. It’s not a unique problem for an open-world game to have, but Frontiers’ inability to load in a timely manner is so common that it just makes everything feel flimsy and unpolished. Sonic Frontiers is a delightfully weird and experimental evolution of the Sonic games so many of us grew up with. Its series of open-world islands are filled with so much variety and pieces of Sonic history, from classic platforming stages to silly minigames, that they’re enjoyable to explore even when awful graphical pop-in is a constant hedgehog spine in your side. Some of the new stuff Frontiers tries out, like the smart toggling between 2D and 3D perspectives out in the open world or the Cyber Space levels, are fantastic ways to pack as much Sonic goodness as possible into one package, while others – especially combat – are uninteresting experiments gone wrong. Still, I largely enjoyed my time running around in Frontiers, making it feel like a very promising first attempt at what could be a bright new era for Sonic and friends. "
103,Marvel Snap ,8.0,"Want to have the Guardians of the Galaxy in the palm of your hand, leaping into play, guns blazing, and even fighting alongside Yondu once more? How about putting together your ultimate Avengers crew and doing battle across Stark Tower, Central Park and the Daily Bugle? These are the kinds of dream teams and fantastical scenarios that Marvel Snap allows, and its excellent use of the Marvel licence is packed into a punchy portable card game where matches are short, the gameplay is easy to grok and you’re encouraged to check in every day. Spoiling the fanfest a little, however, is the actual process of building out your card collection, which I’ve found to be a long grind that eventually loses its early momentum. Marvel Snap is wonderfully streamlined: your deck consists of only 12 cards - no duplicates - and games last for six rounds. The board has three locations to contest, but the locations that appear are random and pulled from a large pool, with one revealed each turn over the first three rounds. Players queue up their actions simultaneously each round, deciding how to spend their available energy (which increases as a match progresses) to play cards to the locations of their choice. Once both players have ended their turn, the cards are revealed one at a time, triggering their effects. The end goal is to have more power than your opponent in two of three locations, so there’s an impressive amount of strategy in choosing where to play your cards, not to mention how to take advantage of favourable locations and mitigate difficult ones.  Because each round happens simultaneously, Marvel Snap is a bit like a series of rock, paper, scissors encounters where you’re trying to anticipate what your opponent is likely to do. On top of this, at any point you can choose to “snap” to double the stakes of that match from the next round onwards, and your opponent can snap back at any point to double them again. The stakes themselves are cubes that raise or lower your ranking - so by the end of a game in which no one snaps, the winner gets two cubes, whereas if both players snap, eight cubes are up for grabs. And if your opponent snaps and you feel that winning is incredibly unlikely, you can retreat to lose fewer than you would by playing out a doomed match. Knowing when to snap, when to go all-in and when to retreat is critical in making progress on the ranked ladder (the only mode currently available) and goes hand in hand with a robust understanding of the meta. And for a game where each individual match takes around three minutes, there are a lot of decisions that have to be made. Each of the half-decent decks I’ve played so far in Marvel Snap have had a lot of non-obvious interactions or strategies to learn, all of which make them satisfying to play optimally. And of course, so much of what you do is based on what your opponent is doing: how they’re utilising the locations and what lines of play they’re likely to take based on what you know about their strategy and win condition. So many games in Marvel Snap come down to the final round, with a win on the table if you can correctly anticipate your opponent’s play. It really can be incredibly engrossing, and like all CCGs, the better you understand all of your options, the more you’ll get out of it. Marvel Snap has a diverse range of deck archetypes, supported by a host of interesting mechanics and keywords. There are decks built around discarding from your hand, having a large hand size, utilising ongoing effects, destroying your own cards, moving cards between locations, cheating big minions out, locking down locations, playing cards with no abilities, repeating “on reveal” triggers, and so on. The card pool has a little too much disruption for my tastes, which means that there are a number of decks out there that look to shut you out of any attempt to execute your gameplan; locking off locations and/or filling your locations with worthless cards. Not exactly fun. Mind you, the locations themselves often do a pretty good job of locking you out on their own, and the whole concept of having three random gameplay modifiers each match is very much a mixed blessing. Yes, it means that every game is different and you need to think on your feet - but it also means that there will be combinations of locations so antithetical to your strategy that the best play is to retreat while you’re only losing a single cube. The ability to retreat really is the only reason Marvel Snap is able to build its gameplay around a system with such high variance and not have it ruin the entire game. Even so, you’ll still be the beneficiary of - and fall victim to - absurd high rolls that are based purely on randomised location modifiers, and that’s not really something I want in my card games. There are more than 50 locations in total, from Baxter Building and the Quantum Realm through to Wakanda, Asgard, Atlantis, Knowhere, and the X-Mansion. Marvel fans will enjoy seeing how deep the cuts go, and how the location’s ability ties into its comic book origins. Ego, for instance, is a super rare location, but when it’s revealed, Ego takes over and plays your cards for you. It’s amazing flavour, but really does turn that match into a coin flip, which - again - is not my cup of tea. Thank goodness for the option to retreat. Another important aspect of the location system is that there are regular  “hot locations” and “featured locations,” both of which mean a particular location will appear significantly more frequently in games during that period. It’s like a mini meta table flip that’s designed to send players scrambling to build decks that take advantage of that location’s ability to get an edge on the competition. It’s a clever idea in theory, but in practice I think it’s actually just unfriendly to more casual players who aren’t necessarily plugged into the ecosystem enough to know how to capitalise on it. Instead, they may just find that their favourite deck is almost worthless for 24 hours. The times when the locations really shine are when they’re less binary: when you’re able to overcome a bad location or work around significant limitations to still snag a victory, so there’s certainly some upside. They also add yet more Marvel flavour, and it’s not like this game is lacking for Marvel flavour in the first place. In fact, Marvel Snap has to be one of the best uses of the Marvel licence in video games to date. It would still be great without it, but the team at Second Dinner really has done a fantastic job of delivering a game that fans will truly relish. There are just so many characters in the roster already - both iconic titans and niche picks - and the primary card art for them all is uniformly excellent. The variant art also has some absolutely incredible interpretations, although I must say most of the pixel variants feel pretty flat to me. It’s also a shame that variants are treated as entirely different versions of the same card, as I’m rarely excited to unlock a variant when it means I’m not gaining access to some new character instead. Marvel Snap’s collection track, which is how you unlock new cards, is built around the art too. You’ll unlock cards as you progress along the track, which is fueled by cosmetically upgrading your cards with resources earned from playing. First they burst out of the frame, then with each additional upgrade they become more elaborate, adding an impression of depth, adding movement in the background and eventually hitting max level, “Infinite.” For me this is largely a means to an end, but the animations and art are still slick enough to still be a fun moment. Second Dinner’s designers have tried to represent each character’s comic book identity in their gameplay too, so Mystique copies an ability for you, Magneto pulls opposing cards to him, Storm floods a location and Bucky Barnes transforms into the Winter Soldier when destroyed. The animations are a joy as well - Nightcrawler BAMFs into position, Green Goblin flies over to the other side of the location he’s dropped on, Miles Morales flips acrobatically into play, Yondu whistles to slice up an opponent’s card with his arrow, and Ant Man shrinks or grows when you pick him up then returns to normal size when he lands on the board. I mentioned earlier that cards are unlocked through your collection level, but it’s worth underlining just how different this is from what’s expected of the genre. This, after all, is a collectible card game in the same broad space as Magic: The Gathering and Hearthstone… and it has no card packs. There is no way to (quickly) buy your way into a collection. Instead, you need to earn the boosters and credits that can upgrade your cards, which then gives you points that contribute to your progress along the collection track, which has a variety of rewards spaced along it. You can also skip the boosters and just spend credits on fast upgrades in the shop, but even so, there’s a limit to how often you can do this. The collection track is broken up by card pools, so for the first part of your journey in Marvel Snap, you’ll be unlocking cards in Pool 1. These are foundational cards and, regardless of the order in which you unlock them, you’ll be able to cobble together a reasonable enough starter deck. Crucially, while you’re in Pool 1 you’ll face off against players at a similar position on the collection track, so their card collection will be roughly the same size as yours. This makes the early game experience really friendly, as you’re playing against people (or bots if there’s no one to match up against) who are also finding their feet and getting a feel for how to build decks. This eventually extends into Pool 2, which is a relatively small collection of cards that cater to narrower game plans. Getting through the first two pools doesn’t take all that long, and everyone who reaches that point will have the exact same collection of 97 cards; the same foundation to work from. Marvel Snap up until this point is like frolicking in shallow, balmy waters; splashing about amongst itsy bitsy waves under an azure sky. It’s when you dive into Pool 3 that you realise just how vast, and at times unforgiving, the ocean that stretches all the way to the horizon can be. Pool 3 has another 75 cards (as of this review), but no definitive end point in the collection track, and that’s because the “mystery card” unlocks that guaranteed cards in pools 1 and 2 are replaced by “collector’s caches” and then “collector’s reserves,” both of which only have a percentage chance to unlock a new card. Just like the ocean, the post-Pool 2 collection track feels like it goes forever. In reality, you should have a complete collection by the time you reach a collection level of 3000-3500 (after starting from just under 500), and that’s going to take some serious time. I’m not even close. There’s nothing wrong with long term progression in games per se, but this feels agonisingly slow, and it’s where the randomness of the system really starts to bite. It’s pure luck whether you’ll open the key cards you need to build viable Pool 3 meta decks, and given the Pool 3 meta game is largely built around high synergy combo decks, if you’re missing a crucial part of a combo, the deck’s not going to function. If you don’t get useful cards as you increase your collection level, you’ll be stuck playing (mostly) Pool 2 strategies against players who may have far more potent collections. And regardless of how lucky you are, while you’re inching your way along the collection track, the new deck opportunities feel few and far between. It’s a shame, because in Marvel Snap’s early going, I was unlocking new cards at a steady rate and regularly making changes to my decks to test things out. Later on, when the meta should theoretically be extremely varied because everyone has different collections, it actually feels like the best strategy is to stick with a strong Pool 2 deck and only switch it out when you get enough Pool 3 cards to build one of the strong combo decks. The shared early game collection actually becomes a limiting factor. The card acquisition side of things is set to be addressed through “Collector’s Tokens” in an as-yet-undated update, and these will be earnt through the collection track and can then be spent to unlock a specific card from an ever-changing randomised selection in the shop. You won’t be able to simply craft the single card you want, but this will give players some actual agency in building their collection. It can’t come fast enough. That, mind you, will be one more currency in a game already clogged with them. Credits, gold, season pass points and boosters all interact and overlap in different ways, and while the feeling of overall collection progression slows right down, you are at least always earning currencies, thanks to the six daily missions (or more, if you spend gold), as well as the season missions, both of which contribute to your season pass progress, which in turn unlocks more credits, gold and boosters. There isn’t a great deal of incentive to spend money in Marvel Snap beyond the paid track of the season pass, which offers acceptable rewards if you’re intending on playing enough to complete it. Spending money on gold, meanwhile, offers very little prospective value given how expensive it is to turn it into credits, new daily missions or card variants, the last of which are just absurdly expensive. All told, Marvel Snap offers a very different journey to other card games. It’s a slow and steady path that rewards you for dipping in and playing a modest amount each day. There’s no way to effectively pay for power, which means there’s no temptation to drop a hundred bucks or more to quickly get the cards you want, the way there is whenever Hearthstone or Magic releases a new set. And as someone who plays both those games, those costs can really add up. Is this system better? It depends on what kind of player you are, and whether you’re prepared to stick with Pool 2 decks (which, admittedly, do remain pretty effective) while you grind your way through Pool 3. One last thing to address is that, as of this review going live, Marvel Snap only has one option for playing games: ranked. While your ranking really only represents bragging rights given matchmaking appears to be based more on how high your collection level is, there’s still no doubt that the option to play against friends would be a huge boon, as would an unranked mode where I could feel free to experiment with no stakes, and where games would always go the distance. Both these modes are on Second Dinner’s roadmap and I think they’ll help present Marvel Snap’s personality-packed gameplay in an even more appropriate light. Marvel Snap upends the collectible card game genre with some truly fresh ideas, impressive strategic depth, wonderfully slick presentation, and a fantastic use of the Marvel licence. Not everything it attempts is an outright win, however. Its high variance gameplay can be frustrating, but is mitigated by the short games and ability to retreat mid-match, while the collection system represents a bold move away from the norm of buying into a collection, but ultimately feels slow and unsatisfying beyond a certain point. Even so, Marvel Snap deserves a place in the pocket of card game players and Marvel fans alike. "
104,God of War Ragnarok ,10.0,"How do you follow up on one of the greatest video games of all time? Sony Santa Monica finds itself in a situation not dissimilar to when Francis Ford Coppola created the sequel to his mob movie masterpiece, The Godfather. Like part two of the Corleone story, God of War Ragnarok puts a fierce, younger member of the family directly under the microscope. In doing so it manages to reach the heights of its predecessor and, in some ways, even tower above it. The writing, performances, and music are each exceptional, bringing this expansive Norse tapestry to life – but even as it holds your heart in one hand with its elegantly told story it’s crunching bones in the other with fantastically ferocious combat. It all binds together to forge a monumental action epic that adds yet another impressive landmark to the video game landscape. Keeping things broad and spoiler-free, Kratos' story picks up a few years after the final revelations of 2018's God of War – this is absolutely not one of those sequels where everything will make sense without playing the first game, or at the very least watching the included story recap (which is probably too brief to serve as anything but a jolt to the memory). The apocalyptic Ragnarok is coming, and its events circle around his son Atreus like one of Odin's ravens. Fimbulwinter – a time of unrest that presages Ragnarok – has very much come and, during the intervening years, Atreus has been growing stronger, learning about his Giant name ""Loki"", and trying to convince his father to trust him. There are touching callbacks to the hunting scene from the 2018 God of War as Kratos proudly watches Atreus prove that he’s no longer a child. But it’s no slow introduction: Ragnarok wastes no time in stepping into the action and, after a breakneck opening battle, the first step of this new journey is to leave the frozen realm of Midgard and find a missing Norse god in the broader and varied universe.  It may not be as tightly told a story as 2018's, but Ragnarok has much grander designs. This is a sprawling epic that always keeps things on the move without ever becoming disorientating, gluing me to the edge of my seat as it repeatedly toyed with expectations. It's an ambition regularly met by stunning execution, with a momentum that never slips as you hurtle towards its bombastic ending. This journey took me just over 28 hours with a few fair side quests completed along the way, but with plenty still left to do afterward. Prophecy and sacrifice swirl at the story’s centre as it repeatedly prods at the concept of destiny and whether blood runs thicker than the ink that pens it. It doesn’t merely offer up surface-level readings of these themes; instead, each character and their motives are given the respect they deserve by delving in deep. It’s a truly special and fittingly grand conclusion of Kratos’ Norse saga, as well as providing resolution to some of his more troubled Greek memories. There are twists and turns aplenty, with fakeouts and misdirection woven into the story’s fabric as it darts between loud spectacle and tender conversation. Characters old and new play their own crucial parts, including fresh characterisations of Norse behemoths like Thor and Odin, with a line of dialogue rarely wasted between them. These are truly unique depictions, and it's a credit to Sony Santa Monica and the actors playing each that I wasn’t reminded once of their MCU equivalents. Despite being laden with myth and melodrama, there's still plenty of time for welcome pockets of self-aware silliness that almost always elicit a laugh, whether that be another bizarre dwarven contraption or the simple thrill of Kratos eating a sausage. When not eating dinner, Kratos’ thunderous voice actor Christopher Judge frequently engages in smartly realised dialogue with his equally impressive castmates. Make no mistake, though: this is firmly Judge's court, and one he frequently dominates. Kratos' traumatic personal history is reflected in everything from his mournful tone of voice to his appearance - his Icarus wings are long-since clipped, but his complexion is still pale like a square of wall where a family portrait used to hang. Death weighs heavy in the winds that guide him on every journey he takes, whether delivering it himself or searching for some closure. The everlasting cycle of violence between parents and their children has long been a theme ever since the original God of War trilogy, although one that was only truly emphasised in 2018’s revival. Now it’s an inescapable fixture of Ragnarok; an exploration of the rawest and most human of emotions, and what happens when they are channeled through superhuman vessels. Pain leads to anger, anger leads to hate – this is the genesis of the stalking threat embodied by the incomparable force that is a grieving mother. Portrayed incredibly with a newfound fury by Danielle Bisutti, Freya is a striking presence to be reckoned with in the sequel and casts a much darker shadow this time around. No longer just a helpful witch in the woods, she’s given a whole new spectrum of emotional depth to play in, and Ragnarok is all the better for it. Each character is given their own moments to shine throughout; Sunny Suljic fires back regularly with the sharp, teenage tongue of a brasher, more confident Atreus, and Alastair Duncan’s severed head accessory Mimir continues to provide levity and exposition in abundance. Various newcomers to the vastly expanded cast also deliver fantastic performances, with a particular standout being Laya DeLeon Hayes, radiating infectious energy from the mysterious Angrboda. Ben Prendergast brings warmth to the nuanced Týr – he's charmingly plucky as the Norse God of War. The foul-mouthed Brok and skittish Sindri continue to bring their unique brand of dwarven charm while granting you those all-important upgrades. They often provide pockets of humour, as well as a lot of genuinely helpful info along the way as they play a much more central role in the story this time around. Also returning is composer Bear McCreary, whose score – like the dwarven smith brothers – goes hammer and tongs from the first moment to the last. There's some truly beautiful music to be heard along the journey, as well as explosions of raw orchestral power during intense fight scenes. The artistry bursting from every seam is astonishing – even when running in the high frame-rate favouring Performance mode – with excellent costume and world design on show. Ragnarok is incredibly well polished, with little details from the etchings on a dagger to the clunk of a cupboard door closing shown love. It’s expertly animated, with saliva-sputtering grimaces launching towards the lens during the heat of battle, and hair flowing realistically on Kratos’ less-follically challenged enemies. Layered writing, impeccable acting, and stunning set design are all crucial aspects in driving God of War’s filmic aspirations home, but they’re also never let down by the rock-solid technical craftsmanship at work. The one continuous camera shot style of 2018's reboot returns, snaking through the entirety of Ragnarok as if mimicking the world serpent Jörmungandr himself. The technique may have lost a little of its initial wow factor four years on, but it's still a remarkably impressive achievement that has several new tricks to show off, and only adds to Ragnarok's cinematic nature. God of War’s combat has always been the flashy attraction that draws a crowd in to be wowed by its story, however, and Ragnarok continues that tradition. It may seem familiar at first – and indeed some things remain the same – but it isn't afraid to play with expectations and throw a curveball your way. Kratos’ blades whip around in every direction, delivering a clanking firey pain to any face they meet. Heavy cleaves of his axe crunch into enemies, making them fold like bloodied origami. And yes, that axe still slices through the air, meatily lodging itself into anything unfortunate enough to be in its path, before being recalled to your palm with a hearty kick from the DualSense controller’s haptics in what remains one of the most satisfying button presses ever assigned to a controller. It's all unapologetically fast, and undeniably glorious – harking back to the brand of frantic action in which the series was originally rooted. There’s a fair helping of excessive violence on show, with Kratos willfully impaling and ripping apart any enemy put in front of him. Arenas are often tight spaces full of threats, and though you aren’t going to see the return of dozens of enemies on screen at once that spawn in wave after wave, that doesn’t mean there aren’t some aspects of those older games shining through. But even with that slight shift to old-school action, Ragnarok’s eyes are still drawn more to the shimmer of Nathan Drake's gold rather than Bayonetta's platinum. Cinematic spectacle takes precedence over the chaotic, bordering-on cartoonish action of old. The axe feels largely similar to how you remember (and that’s no bad thing) with its dynamic mix of heavy attacks and ranged power, but how you wield the blades is noticeably different. There's a greater emphasis on using them to hook enemies and maneuver them around the arena – whether that be dragging them in towards you or juggling them in the air like the hottest of potatoes. They're much closer to how they felt in the original games; a nostalgic move set with a brilliant modern edge. The action feels and looks outstanding and there are no caveats or exceptions when I say that Ragnarok is only an improvement over God of War’s already ferocious combat. Both weapons have new tricks to show off, too: you can “Frost Awaken” the axe by holding in the triangle button to power up your next attack, or mash the same button while the blades are equipped to ignite them. Locking down an enemy by freezing them with the axe before switching to the blades to unleash pain on their friends is an endless source of enjoyment. Even the shield is now more of an offensive tool, and different types can be bought and crafted to fit your playstyle. A sturdier one can soak up heavier hits, while a high-risk/reward version boosts your parry's effectiveness. Parrying has a delicious weightiness to it, and when you nail the timing, it still feels fantastic after the thousandth deflect. Trust me when I say that's a skill you'll want to perfect before taking on some of Ragnarok's toughest fights, as well. Runic abilities (special cooldown attacks assigned in your inventory) also return and, while there isn’t the same abundance of choice this time around, each is devastatingly effective. For example, Hades Retribution – a fiery stab that lodges a bomb into the ribcage of an enemy – is particularly fun to put into action. Brutal finishers on stunned enemies are another enjoyable throwback to the God of War of old. Heads are dismembered, waists are left standing and spouting blood, and torsos are carved in two. There's noticeably a good amount of variety in the randomly chosen, weapon-specific animations, too, so you won't get bored of seeing that one head stomp execution move from 2018 over and over again. My favourite has to be the simple pleasure of seeing the shock on a soldier’s face as their arms are hacked off one by one. Beautiful. Most importantly, all of these additions give an extra tactical edge as you mix up the cadence of your strikes and control each fight. Kratos is a little lighter on his feet this time around, with a bit less of a thumping clomp to his sprint. Movement is further emphasised by the way you can now grapple up from a distance using the blades, and launch across gaps to dive into combat. Taller arena design literally adds extra layers to battles, allowing you to leap from a ledge to deliver death from above. Combat sequences can feel akin to Doom kill boxes as you dash and swing around elevated platforms toward your next victim in performances of acrobatic bloodshed – juggling cooldowns, Atreus’ arrows, and your rage meter to efficiently and spectacularly destroy everyone sent to stop you. You're required to think on your feet much more and take into account a vastly increased variety of enemy attacks and status effects such as burn, frost, poison, and many more that affect both you and your attackers. Each fight feels like a real occasion as you slalom your way through ranged, parryable, and unblockable attacks in order to sneak in a hit or two. Enemies can now perform powerful-but-interruptible attacks signified by a blue ring above their head in addition to their regular skills. A double tap of the shield will sort these out, but get your timing wrong and you're in line for some considerable pain. Combat really develops over time too, as small wrinkles and bigger game-changers are introduced throughout. Environmental strikes – such as ripping a jagged tree from the ground before swinging it like an oversized baseball bat – are often available to introduce to an unfortunate soul’s face. There are plenty of other big additions to combat that I won’t divulge so as not to ruin the sensation of discovering them yourself, but Ragnarok includes some of the most eye-catchingly colourful magic attacks I’ve ever seen in a game, beautifully destructive summon abilities, and much, much more. All are further examples of Sony Santa Monica's seemingly endless pool of creativity. Ragnarok has myriad more tools in its bag than God of War 2018 ever did, and is all the more enthralling for it. It all feels exceptional when in full flow, often mesmerising with its top-tier action drenched in rhythmic brutality, and is quite simply the best combat I can remember playing in a game. And that just goes for the regular fights. Boss battles are of both a higher quantity and quality, including one encounter that makes the opening Stranger fight from 2018 look like a playground scuffle. There are definitely some of those huge boss fights that were so much more prevalent in the original trilogy this time around, with creatures regularly of a bigger scale than we saw four years ago. A lot of these one-on-one encounters are a true test of your capabilities as well, and even when playing on the Give Me Balance (medium) difficulty setting I’ve found myself needing resurrection stones far more than I did in the previous game. It’s not just the story bosses, either – I’ve fought massive alligator bastards called Dreki on more than one occasion, which are a real event to fight and more of a challenge than 2018’s trolls ever posed. It's great to see sprinklings of that old-school monster mayhem thrown into the mix, which manages to successfully offset some of the more serious stretches of the story. Puzzles offer much of what you'd expect – lodging the axe into objects to keep them from moving or freezing them to redirect water flows, burning vines to get elevators working, etc. Smart new puzzle ideas are consistently introduced, though, and build in complexity throughout as more abilities are added to your arsenal. They’re often fun and never in danger of slowing your progress to the detriment of the plot, but even so, Atreus or Mimir can come in with a hint far too early and sometimes rob you of that satisfying ""aha!"" moment. It's a very rare annoyance in a world where normally every last word is a joy to listen to.  Armor customisation has been streamlined, resulting in the removal of the slotting system for a more straightforward upgrading mechanic. Enchantments are now placed inside a separate amulet rather than spread over various pieces of gear. This division makes seeing what you have equipped easier and means you aren't lost delving into too many menus within menus. This also means you can upgrade a piece of armour and take it with you through your journey if your playstyle happens to perfectly click with a certain set (or if you just love how it looks). I found myself changing up my builds regularly throughout, however, as I kept wanting to experiment with all Ragnarok has to offer. The same goes for weaponry, which can be upgraded, as well as fitted with attachments such as individually named hilts and handles, each with its own perks and bonuses. Who wouldn’t want to play with the Stonecutter’s Knob, after all? Further experimentation is encouraged by the new skill token system, which allows you to add damage, stun, elemental, and other boosts to any unlocked ability. It really does feel more like you're being encouraged to build your Kratos this time around, rather than playing with a pre-designed action figure straight out of the box. It’s not stingy on the availability of resources needed to craft gear, further prompting you to inject your personality into a build. It’s an accessible level of RPG tinkering without ever becoming overwhelming. Realms old and new are regularly a sight to behold – many looking torn from the pages of fairy tales, stocked with oversized flora and fauna. There's an extra effort to delve deeper into the mythology this time around and, as someone who's a fan of the Nordic source material, it's a real pleasure to see all of the different interpretations of creatures, people, and places they inhabit brought to life in all manner of delightfully weird ways. The dwarven city of Nidavellir is a welcome rural change of scenery, with its many homes and tunnels that Kratos must amusingly crawl around in. It's at the centre of the rocky realm of Svartalfheim, where waterways weave through islets littered with bubbling geysers. There’s a real sense that the realm was ripped right out of the Old Norse Poetic Edda’s home of Iceland. Those geysers are also key to solving many of the puzzles in the region as you freeze them to create stepping stones and manipulate machinery – quirks like this help in making each place feel unique. Similarly, fun new ideas are introduced in the returning Alfheim, such as reflective crystals that you can ricochet your axe off of to open doors or even use to blindside unwitting opponents in combat. It's a further example of not only each realm looking distinct, but also feeling distinct to play in from one another. Every location almost feels like a puzzle box that you’re gradually unlocking through a combination of brain and brawn as you make your way through it. There's also plenty to discover, with some realms surprising in their vastness. Exploration is encouraged via boat on the Dwarven seas, or via dog sled across Elven deserts. Once again, Metroidvania elements encourage you to revisit blocked paths at a later date once you own the skill required. These new worlds bring with them dangerous new threats. If there were any faults to be found in 2018's revival, then modest enemy variety may well have been one of them. However, there is no such issue in Ragnarok, with its bestiary vastly expanded to accommodate all sizes and shapes of creatures. Familiar foes such as draugr and elves have made their way across, but this time they're joined by Grims which, you guessed it, are pretty grim scuttling toad people, and a personal favourite, the Einherjar; Aesir warriors who harness the power of the Bifrost that makes a section of your health bar glow before removing that chunk on the next hit. Each forms a part of a whole – there’s an engaging but never unfair difficulty curve throughout as you’re met with progressively greater threats. Side missions are sometimes spectacles in their own right. Standout Favours involve helping giant creatures in distress and adventures full of personal revelations through the lush jungles of Vanaheim. They are a great source of character development as you learn more about your friends and companions by helping them right past wrongs. Some side quests do just present a pure gameplay challenge over extra stories, however, such as hunting down powerful legendary enemies dotted across the realms of Yggdrasil’s roots. There is no shortage of genuinely tough side boss encounters, either. While I was perhaps taking them on too early out of eagerness, they were a great test of skill nonetheless. Chipping away at larger health bars is a really satisfying challenge and remarkably well-balanced against the standard quick-kill nature of the majority of Ragnarok’s fights. It’s yet another testament to the masterful combat design on display. And yes, there are some absolutely tough-as-nails, endgame-level challenges to rival the Valkyries of 2018, but I'm going to let you find out what those are for yourself. There's a substantial slew of collectibles to clean up as well with Odin's Ravens, puzzle chests, artifacts, and much more to find in every corner. There's a ton to be done after the main story has been brought to a close, all of it incredibly moreish and fun to complete. Regardless of their nature, all of the optional content is joyously snackable. They not only flesh out the world of Ragnarok and riff smartly on the mythology, but also serve as valuable father-and-son time, with the end of the world creeping ever closer. Ragnarok never once rests on its laurels, throwing new ways to play at you until the very end. Despite having a seemingly endless amount to praise here, I really have barely scratched the surface of what God of War Ragnarok has to offer – I’m deliberately omitting dozens of secrets and surprises. I wouldn't dare spoil what's to come for anyone booting it up for the first time, but rest assured, there are both huge story moments and fresh gameplay additions that live up to and often surpass expectations. Taken all together, much like The Godfather Part 2, God of War Ragnarok delivers not only a chapter that reaches the lofty heights of its predecessor but leaves it impossible to imagine the series without it. An enthralling spectacle to behold and an even more exciting one to take the reins of, God of War Ragnarok melds action and adventure together to create a new, unforgettable Norse saga. Impeccable writing, pitch-perfect performances, knockout action – it’s a complete work of art from top to bottom. Reflecting its core themes, it's everything a sequel should be: respectful of its legendary lineage, but not afraid to take it to exciting new places. God of War Ragnarok is an almighty achievement and creates a new high that makes many of its peers look positively mortal by comparison. "
105,Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord ,8.0,"The claustrophobic press of frenzied melee, whistling of missiles, and thunderous charge of cavalry are often represented in games, but rarely so personally as in the Mount &amp; Blade series. It’s not often I get the feeling I’m experiencing what must’ve been the needs of a commander at eye-level on the field trying to maneuver his forces, or being forced to desperately scramble among bodies for a quiver of arrows or fresh shield. This is the appeal of Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord, and it outweighs all of the holes, bugs, and underwhelming strategy and roleplaying mechanics you have to wade through to get here. When you reach the battlefield, this low-fantasy medieval simulation is unmatched. Bannerlord drops you into the shoes of a capable, temporarily impoverished wannabe in a sandbox world based on late antiquity, complete with a fragmenting Roman Empire stand-in. It's an engaging scenario for its variety of combatants, mercenary bands, and warring societies, each with a unique historically-based way of fighting. In contrast, Bannerlord's main story is very thin, but revolves around finding the remnants of an ancient and symbolic banner – then deciding whether to use it to finish off the empire or take the banner to reunite its fragmented territories.  It qualifies as a sandbox because how you rise to power is largely up to you, whether on a trade fortune, becoming a famous mercenary, or working from inside one of the eight kingdoms. From there it's all about conquest in the name of your chosen nation – or throw that out the window and start a faction of your own. That said, the actual kingdom-management strategy is weak due to shallow mechanics and lackluster AI – it's really just an excuse to raise big armies and smash them together. You do that via maneuvering in an overworld strategic layer before dropping into hybrid action real-time strategy battles where you directly control only yourself, but can issue commands to your AI-driven troops. That description paints a picture of a living, vibrant world, where kingdoms and nobles have grand goals and overarching relationships. Sadly, that's not the case. Bannerlord's world is busy enough, with caravans of traders, robber bands, parties of warriors, and peasants scurrying about between settlements like ants, but all that really only exists so you have something of your enemy's to raid, pillage, loot, and burn. Even the diverse settlement characters and noble clans are just an empty relationship bar for you to grind up for bonuses.   Much of that anemia would be a forgivable indulgence if Bannerlord wasn't so rife with simple bugs. Quests will trigger relating to a faction you're not part of. Perks from leveling up, constructing buildings, or enacting kingdom laws sometimes just… have no effect at all. Multiplayer is rife with network and server errors. Perhaps most pervasive are the graphical glitches, which are legion but mostly involve gaps in weapon models and an array of clipping that speaks to a broader lack of attention to detail. Seriously: the would-be empress Rhagaea, one of the eight most important NPCs in the world, consistently has her chin clipping out of her chainmail coif. What the hell is that? Fighting is the meat here. The massive clash of as many as a thousand soldiers on the field is unrivaled, at least at the scale and level of simulation Bannerlord attempts. Whereas the overworld map is very transparently not a simulation of a real world, the combat tries to stick to at least historically plausible outcomes, so swinging a sword often feels desperate and real. No matter how potent you are as a single combatant, a handful of opponents of decent skill can quickly overwhelm you: you are not a god of the battlefield who cuts down a dozen enemies at a stroke. You're just another person, albeit a smarter one than the AI grunts.  On that person-to-person level, Bannerlord's combat is delightful. Chaotic and confusing at first, I soon started to understand the interplay of the four attack angles, parrying, blocking, and types of weapons. Every attack has its velocity measured against the target's, subtracting or adding damage relatively, and tracking the location hit to determine how armored it is. It tracks relative weapon and shield position, allowing attacks to catch on an opponent's counterattack or nearby object. Weapon weight plays a factor, as does elevation, swing length, and even what part of your weapon hits the enemy: Hitting someone with the haft of your axe, for example, does far less damage than the head. Learning all of these little details, then tweaking the difficulty to suit yourself, is what makes Bannerlord’s combat superb. Desperately aiming your attacks, picking targets, and outfighting opponents is pulse-pounding absorption entirely different from the more furious combat of over-the-top action games. That's most on display in multiplayer, where you can test your skill against others in one-on-one duels. For some that's really the whole game, as the fighting-game-like interaction of weapon options builds depth.  Oh, and then throw your character's personal skill out the window when you get into large-scale fights against the AI or another player. Your quick blade might matter a lot in the arena, but when you're crushed into a melee among dozens of others there's no easy escape from enemy attacks, and wide sweeps of your sword are as likely to catch on an ally's spear haft as strike your opponent directly. The chaotic clash of shield walls, or the mixed scrum of a running cavalry battle, is the absolute peak of Bannerlord. Playing online, Bannerlord's Captains mode has two teams of six go up against each other, with each player in command of their own squad of soldiers. The metagame of play here is wild due to Bannerlord's robust commands and troop variety.  Organizing and commanding your soldiers is a high point. Figuring out how to use terrain, elevation, formations, and more on any of the many, quite varied battlefields is a really nice pre-battle puzzle. One hundreds-strong block of infantry is fine in an open field, but terrible for siege assault, for example. I love breaking my infantry off into a formation of pikes when I breached enemy walls, letting those long-reach weapons clear the gap while the heavily armored and shielded troops stormed the intact walls via siege towers. It takes a bit of learning, but thankfully bringing up the orders menu in combat slows time way down (not in multiplayer, of course), giving you precious moments to consider orders and placement before executing a plan. Combine all those considerations with the broad variety of troops to collect and maintain and you're all but guaranteed to find a playstyle that suits you well. A Mongol-esque horde of horse archers? A shield wall of heavy Germanic infantry? A thundering charge of knights? A hit-and-run force of light cavalry? All of those and more are viable choices in Bannerlord precisely because it tries so hard to mimic the ideas of medieval combat. Put them in the hands of other players online and you'll be cursing the guy who invented the shield wall, the crossbow, or my new nemesis: The jerk who figured out you could use a bow from horseback.  I just wish that same attention to detail was demonstrated elsewhere, specifically in the overworld aspect of the campaign. Many other parts of Bannerlord feel woefully underdeveloped, from diplomatic relations to roleplaying decisions, and much of it feels like busywork you can do that has no real impact on the outcome of a campaign. A more focused sandbox that didn't feel the need to have arbitrage-trading economics, or a system of laws and privileges for factions to vote on, would serve to highlight that delicious combat much better, rather than bury each instance of a standout cool fight under an hour of grinding to make it happen.   Much like the creepy, lifeless eyes of its many NPCs and their stiff animations, Bannerlord's world never feels alive. You can go about talking to people, fulfilling their fetch or kill quests, doing empty minigames to convince them of things, even playing Tablut against them, but it's all about finding your way into the next fight. Playing it as a trader simulation or political strategy game will be shallow and repetitive, with little reward. NPCs have no deep motivation and an extremely limited pool of awful dialogue, and even when a relationship meter says you're best friends or bitter enemies, there's no real weight behind it. For a game that's remarkably text-based, Bannerlord just doesn't have any interesting text.  In short, it's good that the combat is fun: Everything that's not a fight is ultimately just a bit of color before you get caught up in a brawl somewhere or decide to kick off a new war. In that way Bannerlord's closest comparable genre is arguably the space sim. You can do a load of different things in a big world, but that world trades detail for scale. All that everything quickly turns to a somewhat-bland nothing via repetition. And there is a lot of repetition: progressing your skills or kingdom in Bannerlord requires an interminable amount of grind, brutally forcing me to repeat the same tasks until I begged for mercy at raiding the same bandit lair maps or retaking a castle the NPCs of your clan have lost for the umpteenth time.  That’s what really hobbles the exceedingly simple strategy layer. Most of the challenge there comes from herding NPCs and running around to give in-person orders. It's so difficult to coordinate the actions of the braindead AI without gathering them into a single army that you'll likely resent any time the other lords in your faction gather one for themselves, because they'll inevitably waste it on whatever objective is closest rather than which one is more vital to your cause. There are just a hundred obvious things missing from this world, in even their simplest forms. I can't send messengers to the AI characters and factions asking for things? Did nobody in this entire world manage to invent boats? Plus, some of what's there is tedious. It's telling that a popular PC mod automates for-profit trading, while another adds copious defensive options so you don't have to spend hours picking off bandits or reclaiming the same castle twice in a single war.  Which brings us back around to combat, because it's most of the way you interact with the world. You can auto-resolve fights when two armies meet, which is nice for skipping past overwhelming stomps, but for real battles it's not worth it for two reasons: The auto-resolve will almost always get dramatically worse results than you could (which is a fairly standard consequence of taking a shortcut like this), and second, opting out of the majority of fights just makes Bannerlord a worse version of medieval strategy games like Crusader Kings or Total War.  Without rich features a sandbox quickly looks like a desert, and barren is what Bannerlord's overworld becomes after 10 or 15 hours of play. And 10 or 15 hours isn't even half of what you'll need to finish a campaign – try 40 to 70 hours. You'll still be playing long after you've seen everything there is to see, seeing it again and again with little by way of variety to distinguish one time from the next. Whether you're still having fun comes down to how richly you're roleplaying to yourself and how much you enjoy the battles.  For all that it gets wrong, however, Bannerlord does have one huge thing going for it: Play sessions can be really short. All those bite-size fights, epic battles, minigames, and quests can fit in a very satisfying hour-long sitting, something that other games of this long-term scope struggle to do. It's a paradox to say that it's a very long short game, but Bannerlord clears that game design hurdle pretty heroically. It’s a shame that Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord lets you auto-resolve its glorious action/real-time strategy combat but forces you to endure dozens of hours of laborious and repetitive activities on its dry, flavorless overworld map. If I could skip over the bugs, shallow grinds, and frustrating non-combat activities around building up your faction and quickly return to battle it'd be easier to recommend. When it comes to simulating a medieval warfare at the ground level between hundreds of soldiers down to every swing of a sword and clash of shields, this is the only game in town. "
106,The Valiant ,6.0,"One part small-scale, isometric sword-and-shield skirmishing and one part continent-spanning treasure hunt for a powerful religious artefact, The Valiant is a medieval squad-based RTS that’s as much clicking as it is conquering. If you microwaved your copies Kingdom of Heaven and Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade and made a scented candle out of the molten goop you might get a whiff of what developer Kite Games is going for here. However, while the result is a competent strategy game overall, it’s also a bit repetitive and shallow – and subsequently not quite as fun as that previous fusion sounds. An adequate way to quickly describe The Valiant might be as a 13th century Company of Heroes. A more accurate parallel, however, might be 2018’s Ancestor’s Legacy thanks to its broadly comparable Middle Ages setting and its very similar range of unit types. They differ considerably in terms of story, though; while Ancestor’s Legacy is more overtly inspired by historical events (albeit loosely), The Valiant is a the tale of a retired crusader knight, Theoderich von Akenburg, and his search for an ancient and dangerously powerful relic – which he’s racing against an equally dangerous Templar of doom to recover. Joining Theoderich along the way is a brave band of medieval expendables, plucked from several corners of the post-classical world.  The Valiant is the kind of RTS that takes a more intimate approach to tactical, top-down combat by focussing on individually managing a handful of units rather than an enormous army. This approach brings with it a fair degree of initial accessibility, because juggling the actions of a half-dozen or so small squads is certainly a lot more straightforward than managing giant swarms of them in something like StarCraft 2. The Valiant also does quite well at pacing its 20-hour campaign to slowly and organically teach us how each of the units tick, rather than handing over the keys to the castle from the first mission. The campaign definitely gets a bit samey in stretches, with a lot of identical encounters staged one after the other, but it was engaging to be exposed to brand-new squads, like the healing War Priests, even late in the main story. Even though certain missions are built around specific units’ abilities, there’s still some inviting flexibility here in terms of how we can approach each mission – and that really opens up in the closing stages of the campaign when all the unit types are unlocked. Only a finite selection of the main heroes and the backup mercenary squads can be taken into each battle, which is a smart way to compel us to find and embrace the tactics that work for our own style instead of being tempted to simply enlist one of each and toss them all into the grinder. For instance, my playstyle is slow and methodical, and thus I found myself gravitating towards doubling down on archers whenever I could. Archers dole out piles of damage from afar but are cut down in any sort of close quarter combat, so my approach was to draw the enemy into battle with my tank-like heroes up front and then rain arrows upon them from a distance. I found cavalry handy, too, for quick hit-and-run strikes against enemy archers – but mounted units are, in turn, vulnerable to spearmen and shieldbearers. This scissors-paper-rock philosophy is obviously typical of the genre but it’s something that The Valiant not only does well, but also communicates clearly in its menu screens. However, things do become a little more cumbersome once you layer on the special abilities and various supernatural powers The Valiant’s heroes possess, or earn as they level up. The aggressive micromanagement required can get a little boring and exhausting at times – and personally I got pretty numb to all the math disguised as magic when success regularly comes down to fastidiously spamming special attacks and boosts, watching them cool down, and then spamming them again. There are some keyboard shortcuts that speed it up a fraction, but it can feel like a bit of a grind. Outside of combat, the need to backtrack considerable distances to replenish squads at camps tends to bog things down, too – and the lack of a manual save option is very annoying when you need to replay lengthy battles that could’ve easily had one or more extra checkpoints. There’s some very basic base building in The Valiant, but only in a few siege missions, and it’s limited to a trio of defensive towers and the chance to build catapults and trebuchets. These missions aren’t quite as fun as they seem, as they don’t seem totally suited to the deliberately constrained squad limit of The Valiant. That is, you need to take over resource facilities around the map in order to build a modest camp and the necessary siege engines – but you can’t really protect all your resource facilities and your camp with your limited squads. You have to traipse back and forth, retreating to your camp every couple of minutes as the castle sends out an attack. There’s a decent variety of locations – even if the combat is all effectively the same whether you’re fighting on snowy mountains, dense swamps, or blazing deserts – and they do look nice at a distance. Character models aren’t exactly brimming with detail when you zoom in, but to be fair they’re designed to be seen at a few millimetres tall. Some of the missions let us tackle objectives in the order we choose but outside of that The Valiant mostly channels us through a specific, linear series of encounters. There are 16 story missions, and there are additional challenges you can toggle on when redoing them, but there aren’t any I’m desperately keen to play again – especially following the infuriating final boss fight. This last clash – which inexplicably strips away every perk, buff, and weapon The Valiant spends the entire campaign encouraging you to select and curate – is absolutely awful and bafflingly hard. It’s deeply unsatisfying to suddenly have bog-standard enemies shrugging off blows from the trash weapons I discarded a dozen missions ago, and having all but one of the special abilities you’ve earned arbitrarily removed doesn’t just feel anticlimactic – The Valiant is outright cheating against you at this point. It’s a shame the stench of the final battle lingers like a fart in a suit of armour, because I otherwise enjoyed the story overall. There’s a fair bit of filler in the middle, and The Valiant has a habit of sidetracking Theoderich with the needs of random royals interrupting his own quest, but the writing is earnest and the voice acting is very good. The Valiant’s story campaign isn’t the only mode available – technically, there’s also PVP play for two or four players, and a cooperative PVE horde mode for three players called Last Man Standing – but it’s really the only scene at the moment. Right now the multiplayer is deader than a medieval monarch with an ambitious, knife-wielding nephew, making it all but impossible to get much out of it unless you’ve brought your own opponents. The Valiant is a serviceable, squad-based RTS that serves up some usually well-balanced sword-clanging action for its heroes and their small bands of merry men, though it wears a bit thin once it’s evident how repetitive and backtrack-heavy the battles can get. There’s a sturdy story to drive it forward, though it too is let down at the last moment by an ill-considered final battle that renders all your decision-making throughout the campaign worthless. And while The Valiant does have multiplayer, don’t count on being able to find any opponents to clash with online. "
107,Star Ocean: The Divine Force ,7.0,"Six years after Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness disappointed fans of the sci-fi JRPG series like me, Star Ocean: The Divine Force feels like a long-awaited return to form in many ways. Its revamped combat is a lot of fun, breathing fresh life into a system that certainly benefits by evolving with the times a bit. Other areas do stagnate, unfortunately, like its lackluster visuals and horrid user interface. But a respectable story full of likable characters makes this a sequel I’m still very happy to have sailed through the stars of. The Divine Force tells a standalone story that isn’t directly connected to any other Star Ocean games, but it does contain quite a few references to past events and characters that were rewarding to catch as a series veteran. This particular tale follows a reasonable young space merchant with a really bad haircut named Ray, who crashlands on the underdeveloped, medieval-like planet of Aster IV. There he meets Laeticia, the prim and proper princess of the Kingdom of Aucerius, and agrees to assist her in fending off a nearby empire in return for help finding his missing crewmates. I enjoyed that the story kicks off at a smaller scale than you might expect from a spacefaring adventure, but things only grow impressively from there, as the conflicts on this backwater planet end up having astronomical consequences that go beyond the stars.  One cool twist is that you’re actually given the choice between following Ray or Laeticia as your main character, with a handful of instances where they split up and you only see what happens with the side you picked. You’ll be able to follow the overall story just fine either way, but there are some smaller moments that won’t make much sense without knowing what happened to the other party. For example, I picked Ray’s path, and at one point there was talk about an arranged marriage between two nations that I had absolutely no context for. However, had I picked Laeticia instead, I would have understood that conversation but potentially missed something else. It’s an interesting storytelling mechanic that encourages you to go back for a second playthrough of the roughly 30-40 hour campaign, though it’s not enough to make up for the lack of a New Game Plus option. I’d love to see the story events that I missed out on with Laeticia, but not being able to transfer over the levels, skills, and equipment of my party is a real disincentive. The Divine Force’s cast of characters is a lively bunch that consists of both Aster IV locals and people from off-planet. The dynamic between your main party is especially fascinating because half of them come from a civilization that hasn’t even discovered the concept of gravity yet, while the other half is casually familiar with warp drive engines that allow spaceships to travel light years. That results in plenty of entertaining and unexpected moments, like when the party is trying to find a cure for a disease that is wiping out Aster IV’s population. Ray’s robotic but surprisingly caring first commander, Elena, is able to create an antidote based on a few bird-dropping samples, but that also involves teaching Laeticia and her comrades about the concept of bacteria. You can also learn more about each character through Private Actions, which are cute cutscene moments that you trigger by talking to your party members while they are scattered around the world’s various towns. Private Actions show off a lot of a character’s personality and quirks, giving them opportunities to talk about more than just the events of the main story. In particular, I really enjoyed learning about Laeticia’s knight guardian, Albaird Bergholm, and his fondness for sweets – he loves them but keeps it a secret because he thinks it's unbecoming of a knight. The issue with Private Actions, however, is that they’re very annoying to find. Just like in past games, Private Actions are pretty well hidden and you have to go out of your way to sniff them out, with no icons or indications to tell you when a new one has popped up. I hated wasting so much time fast traveling to other towns, running around them, and talking to all of my party members in the hopes of triggering a Private Action. The conversations were generally worth having once I found them, but I wish this feature was more streamlined. It’s also disappointing that character animations and faces don’t live up to the otherwise lovely environments you find them in. Characters have this doll-like porcelain look to their expressions that always comes off a little unintentionally creepy. This stands in sharp contrast to the gorgeous 2D character art from Akira Yasuda that primarily appears in promotional materials and box art. Pretty much none of that is in the game itself, which is frankly baffling – the clean lines and sharp, realistic details within the eyes and lips are just so aesthetically pleasing, I was left wondering how the 3D models could end up looking so poor in comparison. Star Ocean’s previous battle system has received almost a complete overhaul in The Divine Force, and it’s one that’s worked out for the better. Here, it plays very similarly to the action-combat of a JRPG like the 2009’s Tales of Graces, which was ahead of its time with the wide variety of flashy skills at your disposal. The Divine Force lets you assign up to three combat skills to each face button in sequential order, and pressing a button three times during a fight will have you carry out all three of those moves in the order you listed them. This new system feels much more flexible and smooth, especially compared to past games –  previously you were only able to set a few skills due to the old Capacity Points system and would end up spamming the same two-to-four skills in battle as a result. But now this problem is completely gone, and the large selection of different combat abilities you can equip keeps battles from ever feeling stale. (That’s also helped by the excellent soundtrack, with the electric guitars of Ray’s battle theme making fights even more exhilarating.) But the real game changer here is the DUMA system, named after the party’s robot companion. With DUMA, the party member you are controlling will be able to rush an enemy down and close the gap between them at high speed. You can even change directions while rushing, and if you turn away from your target’s eyesight you’ll activate a Blindside – a returning feature introduced in Star Ocean: The Last Hope. Blindsides are as powerful as they are fun, momentarily paralyzing enemies and allowing your entire party to wail on them. And while DUMA adds a ton of adrenaline and momentum to combat, it can also be used defensively. For example, you can exchange your ability to rush to instead allow DUMA to reduce the amount of damage your party takes. Being able to switch between modes on the fly like this makes battles more dynamic and exciting. Not only is DUMA invaluable during fights, but it also plays a role outside of combat. You can use DUMA as a sort of jetpack to help you scale buildings in town or up mountains in the wild. You might find hidden purple gems while doing so, which are amusing collectibles to hunt down that help level up DUMA’s different abilities. This semi-open world exploration feels natural while flying around with DUMA, but the landscapes are also somewhat empty and lacking in personality. The vast environments have lots of wide open fields, but they seem large only for the sake of being large. There are no massive changes in elevation, and the fields are mostly just flat without any discernible landmarks. The environments and skyboxes can at least look beautiful, but the layouts of each area aren’t on par with what a game like the impressive Xenoblade Chronicles 3 showed off on the Switch earlier this year. Menus aren’t pleasing to look at either. In the party member screen, you’re greeted with boring and dull black boxes. To make matters worse, whenever you hover over a character, you’re shown their mediocre 3D model instead of those lovely 2D portraits. For all of Integrity and Faithlessness’s faults, one aspect that it did well was its menu, which showed giant 2D artwork of the party members around each other, very similar to what Tales of Arise's menu had. It’s a shame that The Divine Force didn’t attempt to replicate that style. Perhaps surprisingly, the worst offender when it comes to menus is actually the font size. It’s honestly the smallest font that I’ve had to read in a game in recent memory, and I literally had to squint my eyes in order to legibly read subtitles, tutorial info, and skill descriptions. Most games nowadays come with an option to increase the font size, but The Divine Force doesn’t have that. I really hope Square Enix addresses this issue in a post-launch patch because it’s genuinely distracting, and not even having the most basic accommodations for accessibility is unacceptable. That said, the UI issues aren’t so bad that I can’t wait to optimize my party’s gear for the post-credits content that the Star Ocean games are known for. Each character has a specific Item Creation talent, like Ray’s natural affinity for Smithery to create weapons and Laeticia’s Compounding skills to make medicine. The process is straightforward and easy to understand – for example, combining two blueberries makes a blueberry potion – which prevents progression from feeling like a chore. It’s not crucial to make the most of this crafting during the regular campaign, but I know that I’ll have to spend time mastering the system if I want to be properly prepared for the hardest fights that The Divine Force has to offer. The Divine Force isn’t necessarily a standout in this long-running series, but it is a much more successful effort to bring Star Ocean into the modern age than its predecessor. The revamped battle mechanics do wonders for its previously limited combat system, offering more freedom and flexibility than ever before. The main cast of characters is also charming, even if the world they are exploring and the animations that accompany them are far less captivating. I wish its interface issues were less obnoxious, but even so, The Divine Force at least proves that Square Enix’s sci-fi JRPG certainly deserved another shot. "
108,Gotham Knights ,5.0,"From everything I’d seen up to this point, Gotham Knights appeared to have all the makings of the ambitious, action-packed smash hit that it was clearly intended to be. I mean, who wouldn’t want a new, co-op-centric take on Rocksteady’s spectacular Batman: Arkham games that’s built for the current console generation? But then, as I played it for 30 hours, it just kept hitting me with bad news: WHAM! Underwhelming combat. POW! A weak, predictable story. BIFF! Puzzling progression design choices. THWACK! Sub-30 frame rates. I’m left wondering how it went so wrong. Some good parts manage to shine through, like the impressive open-world Gotham sandbox, but its problems never let me enjoy the moment-to-moment crime fighting nearly as much as Bat-family fans deserve. Since Gotham Knights is Batman-adjacent, we need to cover its origin story. Like Bruce Wayne it was born to a well-respected and rich family, in this case the four third-person action games in the Arkham series. That’s not to say that this is a sequel to those games – WB Games Montreal decided to splinter off into a separate version of DC comics canon – and in a lot of places it goes out of its way to chart its own vigilante-based course. But when you’re stealthily grappling from ledge to ledge, crawling through ventilation shafts, and beating up groups of criminals in a rhythmic combat system, it’s impossible not to compare it to the vastly superior Arkham games.  One key difference is that here you get to play as your choice of the four mostly lovable heroes (Nightwing, Batgirl, Red Hood, and Robin) as you zip around an open-world Gotham, delivering justice to all manner of superstitious cowards and unraveling a troubling mystery in the iconic city’s murky streets. That mystery revolves around the death of none other than the Batman himself, which serves as a solid kicking-off point for a new generation of crime fighters to take the spotlight. In the wake of the Dark Knight’s demise, Bruce Wayne’s ragtag gang of current and former sidekicks step into the fray to fill his formidable shoes, and serves as a strong premise to what ultimately turns out to be a lackluster story full of foreseeable twists and unsurprising turns. As various criminal elements rush in to fill the power vacuum left by Batman, the ancient order known as The Court of Owls supposedly becomes the biggest threat facing Gotham, even if they don’t live up to that threat in practice. I quite like The Court as an enemy within the pantheon of Batman rivals, but for a secret society that’s supposed to have pulled the strings of Gotham’s leaders for hundreds of years, it’s pretty amusing that they never really exert that power even as a group of young adults easily foil their plans with a pocketful of gadgets and a couple karate moves. I kept wishing that their far-reaching influence and resources would be wielded in a way that would give me a reason to fear them, but they couldn’t be bothered to do more than send some well-dressed goons after you and shake their fists as you infiltrated their ranks. They just never pose any kind of threat, instead serving as punching bags for you to take out your aggression on the caviar-guzzling, bow tie-wearing, Eyes Wide Shut upper class. But the story’s biggest issue is that it tries way too hard to squeeze an entire rogue’s gallery of potential suspects into its murder-mystery premise, and feels completely disorganized as a result. You spend most of the surprisingly short campaign’s eight story missions jumping from one villainous cabal to another, before arriving at a conclusion I was able to predict practically before the end of the opening credits. It’s devastating to see such an underwhelming plot unfold after the Arkham series included some of my favorite Batman stories of all time, which often left me speechless with their stirring twists and turns. Gotham Knights, by contrast, includes a masked character whose identity is immediately apparent upon first sight and whose inevitable unmasking is laughably anticlimactic. It’s followed up with an ending that’s foreshadowed so frequently and unsubtly that I involuntarily cringed when they actually went through with it. It doesn’t help that the oddly brief campaign is padded out with busywork, like repeated sections where you have to wander around Gotham interrogating a string of different criminal factions headed by everyone from Harley Quinn to Mr. Freeze to gather clues about the next story development, and side quests to unlock table stakes features like fast travel. (That one has you visiting every part of the map to stand around and scan drones for no discernable reason.) In between all those chores, you’ll also have to contend with the RPG elements that force you to grind and min-max equipment before the next story mission can be tackled. All of these things do little more than drag out a story that’s rarely worth the squeeze, and make the pacing even more of a drag than it already is. Even if you are just running around Gotham aimlessly or tackling minor crimes, though, exploring the city can at least be a highlight. It may not get a lot right, but WB Games Montréal succeeds at capturing the fantasy of exploring a crime-ridden city as a caped crusader, and I spent hours just grapple-hooking around and exploring the area. Doing so with a friend is also rewarding, especially since there are no limitations for how far you can be from one another; you can fight together or split up to search for clues to unlock the next main mission, or tackle optional quests twice as fast as you’d be able to do on your own. It’s really nice to not be tethered to another player when you join their world, especially if you’re like me and don’t enjoy playing the role of the sidekick who can’t peel off to investigate when I get easily distracted by shiny objects in the distance. It’s fortunate that each of the four protagonists are fairly likable and well-written too, and there are plenty of amusing quips to help you get through the letdown of a plot. Sure, Red Hood mostly just keeps talking about how he died that one time like the edge lord that he is, and Robin (the Tim Drake version) swings wildly between being deeply depressed by his mentor’s death and making silly jokes, but it’s still impressive that these B-listers and sidekicks manage to step up to the plate as much as they do. (They’ve all had their own stories in comics and TV shows, but few that hold a candle to Batman’s.) That said, glitches do occasionally cause otherwise-touching story moments to instantly transform into comedies, like one cutscene where Jason Todd’s hoodie drawstrings decided to defy gravity and threatened to poke his friends’ eyes out during a tense conversation. It’s also neat how well Gotham Knights’ story adapts to you playing whichever character you want. Since you can switch between any of the four protagonists in between missions, different versions of each cutscene are required, complete with character-specific dialogue depending on who you’ve selected to play as. With a few exceptions where certain scenes don’t make much sense if you played someone else in a previous mission, it’s great that the script recognizes whose butt-kicking boots I’m wearing during different moments. Really, my only major complaint with swapping characters is that each character has to unlock their abilities and be geared up individually, so the longer I played as one the less feasible it was to actually switch to someone else – I’d have to stop making progress to catch up one character and unlock all their special abilities before proceeding. What good is the ability to switch characters when doing so means going back to square one and having to grind XP and gear all over again? Look, I’m no stranger to grinding. I’m a Destiny 2 fan, after all. But what Destiny 2 has that Gotham Knights doesn’t is great combat that I come back to for the fun of it, not just the rewards. Unfortunately, combat in Gotham Knights is one of the worst parts about it – and that’s not a great thing to have to say about a game that’s virtually all about combat. It’s not the worst thing I’ve ever played but if you were hoping for a return to the smooth, incredibly fine-tuned brawls of the Arkham series, you’re in for a rude awakening when you’re smacked in the face with the simple and underwhelming substitute that sits at the center of this disappointing adventure. Playing as these heroes offers some cool playstyles and abilities with which to fight crime, and yet those options almost always take a backseat to mashing the same buttons until everything is unconscious. The oversimplification of combat is perhaps best exemplified by the complete absence of anything resembling the Arkham games’ counter system, an omission that still baffles me even after completing it. At its best, dishing out justice is merely boring as you repeat the same attacks and wait for your special ability meter to charge up and enemy health bars to whittle down (yes, they have health bars over their heads); at its worst, it’s actively frustrating as you’re hit by attacks that seem almost impossible to dodge and don’t feel like you have full control of your character. Fighting crime hasn’t felt this unsatisfying since before Arkham Asylum revolutionized it in 2009, and since you’ll spend a lot of time doing it, this tragic shortcoming is like a deep cut on the roof of your mouth that just refuses to go away. As I played, I kept hoping Gotham Knights would introduce more mechanics later on in the campaign and things would eventually evolve and feel better. It never did. Combat may never become interesting, but I can at least give it credit for the diversity of options available to you. Since there are four playable characters, you can opt to be a hulking, DPS-focused, gun-toting maniac with Red Hood, or a stealthy, tech-hacking egghead by playing Batgirl. Stealthing around with Robin to take out enemies quietly is a markedly different experience from playing Nightwing, who specializes in dancing around the map and buffing allies, and that means you can pick the character that best suits your playstyle and customize it to your liking. As a Robin main, I maximized stealth (partially to minimize time spent in bland combat), and leveled up my ability to apply status effects to enemies, while my co-op partner played Batgirl and transformed her into a tanky beast who could take a beating and revive herself after getting downed. Each character also has their own set of Momentum Abilities: Robin can summon nanorobots to attack his enemies and become invisible to the naked eye, while Nightwing can create bubbles of safety that heal allies and harm enemies. Unlocking these requires – you guessed it – a bit of grinding, and quadruply so because you’ve got to complete challenges with each character individually. But it’s well worth the effort to break up what’s otherwise uninspired combat – they still may not be ""good,"" but at least they're different. My love of crunching numbers and exploiting the meta within RPGs is well-known, but Gotham Knights’ equipment and leveling system is so disorganized that I found myself avoiding my menus as often as possible. As you gain XP and level up, you’ll acquire new weapons and armor, mod components, and crafting schematics to aid your power creep, but unless you’re extremely lucky or willing to grind a whole lot of repeatable crimes in Gotham’s open world, you’re unlikely to have much power over what you’re able to use or craft because drops aren’t frequent or targetable enough to organically build the character you want to play. For example, you might want to obtain weapons that apply a freezing status effect to your enemies and armor that protects against poison to counter a certain enemy type, but you probably won’t have the right items available at your current level to let you create that build. “Maybe they want you to trade with your co-op partners?,” you might be thinking. Nope, there’s no trading system at all! Instead, I just had to work with what I was given, which almost never lined up with what I wanted to do. Crafting isn’t much of a help because its options are equally limited to your random drops and come with significant resource costs that you’ll run dry on if you make use of crafting often (a problem for which the only cure is even more grinding of mindless activities). It’s perplexing to me that non-legendary equipment cannot be upgraded or modified, and even so-called “mods” actually just enhance existing equipment capabilities as opposed to letting you swap in new attributes. The incredible inflexibility of these systems mean that, unless you’re a masochist, you’ll mostly just shrug like I did and say, “Well, my loadout sucks, but let’s go do the mission anyway,” and slog through it. It’s worth noting that there is very little endgame content to warrant building toward. Content runs dry the moment you close the final case file, and you likely won’t ever need to reach the max character level to take on any particular challenge. I’m not sure if Gotham Knights is setting itself up to have a live-service model, a la Marvel’s Avengers (2020), which might justify building out an endgame build to tackle more challenging content, but the RPG landscape would need major overhauls to facilitate that – as of now it, barely squeaks by as a passable system with which to finish the fleeting campaign. Gotham Knights does have a New Game+ option, so you could definitely take your hard-won loadout with you to a tougher version of the campaign… but given how numb my first playthrough left me, I can think of precious few reasons why someone would choose to do so. I’ll say this though: Gotham Knights totally nails gear when it comes to cosmetic customization. It comes with lots of costume options for each hero, and different color schemes available so you can make your outfit your own, including some dope Batman Beyond-themed outfits and other classic costumes pulled from throughout Batman’s colorful history. And if you don’t like the look of whatever armor has the best stats, you can use the transmog system to apply any style you’ve unlocked and ensure you never leave the Batcave looking anything less than suave. There aren’t many things that made me want to return to Gotham Knights after completing the story, but searching for new ways to up my swag game was definitely one of them. If you can conscript someone into joining you after they’ve read this review, playing with a friend is undoubtedly a better experience – and not just because you’ll have someone to show off your outfit to. For one, combat tends to go by much faster with someone else at your side, and pulling off stunts like team attacks where two characters work together to execute a sweet finisher is one of the better things combat has to offer. Unfortunately, many missions feel like they’re balanced specifically for two crime fighters, leaving anyone hoping to treat this as a solely single-player game in a little bit of a lurch. While fighting alone often made me wonder if maybe I needed to grind more first, when I had a friend join my game I usually thought, “Oh, this is why the encounter felt bad before – they wanted me to bring backup.” One example is a fight against some of Harley Quinn’s goons where she sics two beefy bosses on you – I don’t recommend going into that one without a sidekick. There are some weird quirks with multiplayer though, like how slow-motion animations look incredibly awkward to the second player, who’s moving at normal speed. Or when both players grapple hook to the same place, knocking one of them to the ground. Or how you feel very much like second fiddle when in someone else’s game because you don’t appear in most cutscenes, are not allowed to interact with certain objects, and don’t get all the same rewards the host player receives after completing activities. It’s also just super weird that you can only play with a maximum of two players in a game that very deliberately has four playable characters available. I don’t know if the original plan was to include four-player co-op or not, but it never stopped being bizarre to have two heroes caught in a crazy whirlwind of events while two other powerful figures were…off washing their tights or something? In fairness, WB Montreal has already announced a four-player challenge mode that’s coming at a later date, but even then it’ll be separate from the main campaign. Gotham Knights also suffers from performance issues that range from amusing bugs to annoying hindrances, the most grave of which is that the framerate. On the Xbox Series X, a stable 30fps was a rarity, especially when out in Gotham’s open world or during cutscenes – and God forbid I ride on my motorcycle for any amount of time. I’m not one to turn up my nose at a 30fps game versus 60 (which isn’t available here) and generally don’t need a game to be God’s gift to Digital Foundry to enjoy it, but Gotham Knights is pretty rough in this regard. That’s another disappointment when so many other aspects, like graphics, animations, and more, look quite good. Beyond framerate issues, my time in Gotham Knights saw occasional crashes, disconnects during multiplayer sessions, and various bugs from the highly irritating case of a mission target getting stuck in a wall, to silly stuff like riding your motorcycle like such a champ that you glitch through the bottom of the map and fall through the level to your death (losing in-game resources to this is also pretty annoying). I was able to get through it, so I wouldn’t call it completely broken, but it was not a smooth ride. Gotham Knights is a consistently disappointing return to Batman’s troubled city and a distinct step backwards from the past decade-plus of Batman games. Even if running around Gotham in two-player co-op can be decent fun and each of the four playable crime fighters are well executed in their dialogue and distinctive moves, too many of the fundamentals fall short for me to recommend it. From the inconsistent frame rates, to the weak story, to one-note combat that rarely feels good, there was virtually always something going wrong to make sure I wasn’t experiencing the triumphant return with my friends at my side I had envisioned. "
109,Slime Rancher 2 Early Access ,7.0,"After dozens of hours dedicated to wrangling balls of living goop in developer Monomi Park’s previous life sim, it feels great to be back with Slime Rancher 2 – a sequel that retains all of the original’s stickiness (in more ways than one) and ridiculous charm. It may feel like more of a Slime Rancher 1.5 at its early access release, but its presentation is still a night-and-day improvement over the original, the new slimes and areas are wonderful and unique, and movement and exploration both feel much better. All those upgrades combine to create a satisfying and zen-like adventure that made me want to retire from the rat race of battle royales and action games to settle down on a sticky pasture and live a simple life among the slimes. If you’ve played the first Slime Rancher, even a little, then nothing about this work-in-progress sequel is likely to surprise you. As with the first entry, you’ll run around chaotic and beautiful otherworldly environments as you collect resources and slimes, then head back to your home base to turn your jelly friends into profit just like Ayn Rand intended. You’ll also fight gross, world-consuming Tarr slimes, upgrade your base of operations and your equipment, and fall off cliffs when you forget you don’t have enough stamina to power your jetpack. The good news is that this formula of exploring, farming, and experimenting with your slimes and their crossbred permutations remains incredibly compelling, and it’s easy to lose track of time while hanging out with this lovable gang of invertebrates. On the other hand, Slime Rancher 2 plays it so safe that it took me a while to even notice some of the changes it’s made.  At this early stage there aren’t too many new things added – in fact, in some ways there are actually fewer options than in the previous entry, like a reduced number of unique areas and slimes (something the first game bolstered over its own early access period). That said, most of the slimes that are currently MIA were probably strategically cut fat, and the slimes that have been added are more than fair trades for those we lost; I don’t particularly miss the irritating, radioactive Rad slimes, for example, while the new Ringtail slimes that skitter about killing things and get turned into stone if they get caught in the sun are hilarious little troublemakers. Still, it’s weird that obvious stuff that would have been great to have at launch, like NPCs occupying the world or multiplayer options, have been completely eschewed for now. In its current form, Slime Rancher 2 is fairly light on content in general. I began to feel like I was out of things to do after about a dozen hours, and I encountered areas that were incomplete or blocked off in some of my first moments of exploration. Luckily farming for slimes, gathering resources to upgrade your ranch, and exploring what areas you can access are all such wildly captivating activities that I spent well over that time just optimizing my farm and looking for secrets. You can also get a lot of mileage out of the returning crossbreeding mechanic, which merges two types of slimes together to create interesting and often ill-advised combinations, like the exploding crystal abominations I Frankensteined into existence. That’s a rabbit hole that only got deeper over the course of the first game’s developement, and I’m excited to see if this adventure follows suit. But despite the familiarity, it’s impossible not to notice this sequel’s higher level of polish. If the original was a compelling and memorable proof of concept, then Slime Rancher 2 comes much closer to a final product that benefits from years of fine-tuning – even in this early state. This is most immediately recognizable in its presentation, which has been improved substantially. Slimes have a ton of personality now, serving as irresistibly weird creatures to chase – that includes the new cotton slimes that bounce around and joyously eat all your vegetables, as well as returning crystal slimes that come off as mischievous bullies in this iteration who want nothing more than to break everything in their path. The areas are beautiful and diverse too (even if there are only three of them so far), and the UI, music, sound effects, and lighting make everything easier on the eyes and ears, to the point where it hardly even feels like an early access game on the surface. Really the only issues I ran into were occasional bugs, like the all-too-familiar falling through the floor and seeing under the world thing, but those were easy to resolve with a simple reboot and relatively rare. The movement mechanics also have some notable improvements, making jetpacking around the hub areas more fun than ever. Running around is really smooth and platforming from place to place is more precise (which is a good thing, because it plays a larger role now) even if the woefully tiny stamina meter that shares its energy with your jetpack is still a constant annoyance. And while there aren’t many of them yet, each area is impressively large, has lots of verticality to explore, and even has a few puzzles to solve as you hunt for slimes in the wild. I particularly enjoyed the new lava area that can be found in the Ember Valley, which required more thoughtful platforming and offered more danger than past locations. It’s a little disappointing that the main obstacle they throw at you remains unchanged from the first game though, as you’ll still be overfeeding massive Gordo slimes to unlock new areas and shortcuts. This is certainly a fun little mechanic, but I’ve seen it a lot already and there are few fresh challenges to complete alongside it. The main enemy of Slime Rancher, Tarr slimes also make a return, and thankfully they’re more cruel and intimidating than ever before. Previously, this mob of overfed and corrupted slimes were a fairly uncommon and easily handled danger, but now they’re all over the place, spread almost instantly, and can become a serious problem if they’re let loose in your farm. That said, they still aren’t very threatening to you personally as they don’t do much damage and are easily killed by being thrown off a cliff or splashed with water – or, better yet, just avoided altogether. But since they infect everything around them, they pose a real threat to your precious slime resources and can absolutely defile the land you’re trying to tame. I was happy to see a little bit more challenge added to what I think of as the video game equivalent of a spa day, even if it’s only a minor increase. Slime Rancher 2 is a fantastic and charming life simulator that still has lots of room to grow. It probably won’t surprise anyone who played the original, borrowing quite a lot from its predecessor while inventing relatively little so far, but it continues to be bewitchingly fun all the same. If this is just the beginning, then I fully expect this adorable adventure to evolve into something very special – but for now, it’s just a highly enjoyable start."
110,Overwatch 2 ,8.0,"Is Overwatch 2 truly a sequel? It’s a question that has lingered around the second iteration of Blizzard’s multiplayer shooter ever since its unveiling in 2019, and one that intensified when it was revealed that it will fully replace the existing Overwatch, not exist alongside it. Well, now it’s finally in our hands, and I can say that while it’s less of a reinvention and more of an evolution of the intense, nuanced, and brilliantly colourful team-based battle that made its predecessor so enjoyable, it still brings enough new things to the table that it feels like its own distinct game and not simply Overwatch 1.5. The bigger question, as Overwatch 2 begins to open up to the public as a free-to-play game, is how many of those new ideas are positive changes – different is, after all, not synonymous with better, and there are definite improvements here, just not universally so. I don’t mean to sound too negative – the original Overwatch is genuinely among the most fun I’ve ever had with a video game (and one of only two 10s I’ve ever given at IGN), so a step down from that is still something very enjoyable. Blizzard has simply set an incredibly high bar for itself here.  Because it’s not a radical reinvention, Overwatch 2 still revolves around the exciting, team-based hero shooter gameplay that made the original such a massive hit when it launched in 2016. Its sheer variety in character design across its 35 heroes, the ways in which they each feel unique to control, and the charm bursting from every seam remain clear to see. Everybody’s weapons still feel fantastic to wield, and a full pass to the sounds they produce and a slight visual glow-up only add to the empowering joy of battle. Its highs and lows, from the delight of those last-second tactical switch-ups to the agony of a teammate refusing to step onto the objective at a crucial moment, have yet to be fully replicated by any game since. That rush was the beating heart of Overwatch, but one that unfortunately diminished as it descended into a relatively stale affair near the end of its lifespan thanks to a lack of new content and an abundance of shields leading to a tedious meta taking hold. Some of the changes being made in this sequel act as a defibrillator, though, jolting new life into Blizzard’s hero shooter. Outside of the fact that Overwatch 2 is a free-to-play game, by far the biggest shake-up that comes with the sequel is the move from its traditional 6v6 matches to a smaller 5v5 format. It’s just two fewer players in the arena, but it represents a huge ideological shift in which tangible repercussions are immediately felt. Aside from the potential horror of discovering you were the sixth-best Overwatch player out of your friends and finding yourself the odd person out, it comes with both blessings and curses – it fully drags Overwatch 2 out of the stagnant meta swamp its predecessor found itself in over the past couple of years, but also denies itself some of the lustre of its satisfying team play. Team compositions now consist of two damage, two support, and just one tank character. This means only one of the now 10 playable tank heroes can be in play at a time, whereas in old-school Overwatch, tank heroes were largely divided between main tanks (such as Winston and Reinhardt, who control space and serve as barriers between you and your aggressors) and off-tanks (such as Zarya and Roadhog, whose job is to be more aggressive and disrupt the other team). That line has become less distinct with Overwatch 2, with all tanks expected to play a more active role in the battle. “More active” sounds good, but the problem created here is you still need that defensive anchor when driving home a payload, and so a tank’s role is now awkwardly split. When only one is permitted, a certain amount of responsibility is placed on that player’s shoulders to both spearhead the team and bear the brunt of the damage, despite it also being their duty to protect the objective. In my time playing, this led to a prevalence of Reinhardt being selected due to him being one of the only viable protectors available. It begs the question of where “off tanks” fit in right now. D.Va is undoubtedly one of my favourite heroes to play as, but I feel a certain amount of guilt picking her in Overwatch 2 as I fly off in my neon pink mech to hunt down a Widowmaker, leaving my support teammates vulnerable and without protection as a result. This makes the transition of Doomfist from damage to mobile tank even more confusing as there doesn’t feel like much of a place for him at all in the rotation as of now. Simply put, many of the tanks still feel designed for the Overwatch of the past, not the Overwatch of the present. On one hand, this huge shift in team composition is a thrilling breath of fresh air, and – critically – something significant to set Overwatch 2 apart from its predecessor. It's a true test of skill that promotes aggressive play and gives 1v1 fights more significance than before. The reduction in stun abilities that halt you in your tracks or interrupt powers definitely helps the flow of a match, even if it does mean my beloved Cassidy no longer has his trusty flashbang. On the other hand, Overwatch 2 appears to be moving away from the tactical teamplay that originally made it unique among shooters. It just feels like some of that satisfying, team-centric magic has been lost in the process of shifting to 5v5. While it does mean that attritional shield battles thankfully appear to be a thing of the past, moments like perfectly timed ultimate combos – like when a Junkrat RIP-tire works its way towards a group of helpless enemies caught in a Graviton Surge – are now a rarer sight. Matches often feel much more like sets of deathmatch skirmishes rather than longer tactical battles. Many characters have been successfully reworked to fit into Blizzard’s new 5v5 vision. Orisa, one of Overwatch’s sturdiest defensive heroes, has undergone the most significant philosophical shift in terms of how Overwatch 2 is intended to be played by tank players. Her radical transformation from a reliable anchor to a mobile damage-dealer is evident just by looking at her new skill set, but it is felt even more on the battlefield. The whirling Javelin Spin quickens movement and encourages charging toward adversaries to deal the most damage possible with a primary fire that has been improved to deal more damage at closer range. This is in contrast to how Orisa was traditionally used; in the first Overwatch, she sat further back and acted as an anchor point for other players to barricade themselves behind and rain fire upon their opponents. Nowhere is this change in philosophy more apparent than in the removal of her football net-shaped energy shield. As more and more barrier-wielders were added to original Overwatch over time, frustrations with shield-heavy metas rose. I remember too many times when I’d settle in for a fun evening, only to be met with Bastion and a Torbjorn turret safely hidden beneath what seemed like endless layers of shields. These initial adjustments to Overwatch 2 clearly address this, and thankfully, those multi-shield days feel a distant memory due to the significant reduction in barriers being available to deploy. Of course, outside of reworks, there are new heroes joining the party, too – one from each class in fact, which brings the full roster to an impressive 35 in total (especially so when you consider the original launched with just 21). Sojourn, the newest damage character, is armed with a rapid-fire railgun and offers a fresh and viable alternative to Soldier 76. She doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but her nimble skid and super-jump combo, mixed in with her hard-hitting secondary fire, can be deadly. Kiriko is a ninja healer who shares some of her moveset with the damage-dealing Genji, but in reality, she plays more like Moira or Mercy – dashing in and out of the action to aid teammates and dish the odd headshot out with a kunai. She takes a little time to get used to, but can be very effective in highly skilled hands. My pick of the new additions so far, though, is Junker Queen: an aggressive tank, her abilities really sing when chained together as you swing her axe, throw a boomerang-like knife into someone, and finish them off with a shotgun blast. All three of these heroes are as well designed as you’d expect of Overwatch 2’s pedigree and are packed full of character, from their distinct looks to vibrant voicework. None of these new additional heroes shake up Overwatch 2 in any groundbreaking way – I could easily imagine them fitting into the original – but they are all definitely fun to play. In fact, the roster does seem fairly well balanced at launch, which is quite an achievement when juggling 35 different high-powered characters with half a dozen abilities each. Rarely have I seen one hero dominate a whole match, with each shining at different moments. Some things are seemingly just inescapable, though, with Genji still consistently slashing his way to Plays of the Game across my screen six years later. Beyond the shift to 5v5, a big addition to the sequel is the introduction of a brand-new mode: Push. It’s essentially a game of tug-of-war, with a Baymax-like robot pushing a barrier through a map on behalf of whichever team is closest to him. It’s a bit like Overwatch’s signature Escort mode, but here each team is trying to push the robot to the other team’s spawn point, rather than one team permanently defending and one attacking for the whole match. It does a great job of centralising the fight, with both teams focusing on a shared objective, and the more I’ve played of it, the more it’s grown on me. As with a real-life tug-of-war, Push is largely centred on momentum and thus is very hard to wrestle back once things aren’t going in your favour. This does mean that on those rare occasions when you do manage to turn the tide it feels like a real team achievement, though – a thrill that is so synonymous with Overwatch’s other modes. I can see it becoming a real hit. The maps that accompany Push are all well put together, with the traditional mix of winding streets and tight choke points that Blizzard has always implemented effectively into its arenas. They are all lovingly crafted, with art and sound working in harmony to create little details that build into charm-filled wholes. In truth – apart from the odd exception (Paris, I’m looking at you) – map design has always been something that Overwatch has excelled in. The six new additions that come with the sequel are no exception, with the Rio de Janeiro-inspired Paraíso being my current favourite. Its charming, carnival-themed payload that you navigate to Lucio’s club showcases the joy Overwatch 2’s maps can bring when they fuse both gameplay and character together. Unlike its heroes, which are all present and accounted for in one form or another, not every map has made its way over to the sequel. This is down to the removal of the Assault (or Two Control Point) mode. I understand they had their issues, but as much as anything I’m sad to see the places go, rather than the mode itself, and the fact that these maps aren’t even available in quick play is slightly disappointing. Locations such as the Temple of Anubis and Volskya Industries hold a lot of affectionate memories for many. It’s a shame to think of the balconies of Hanamura, where I spent many a high noon, now lost to time. Also a thing of the past for Overwatch are loot boxes – the long-controversial gambling mechanic that has now been replaced by a more modern battle pass system (costing 1,000 Overwatch coins, or around $10). Each nine-week season will bring with it a new series of tiers to make your way through, unlocking a variety of cosmetics, from voice lines to sprays, as you collect XP. It’s a model very familiar to battle royale shooter fans by now, and one that is undoubtedly fairer to players than loot boxes (even if a tiny part of me will miss that small serotonin hit of a legendary skin flying out of a plastic crate). Blizzard has laid out a schedule by which each subsequent season will bring a new map, hero, or sometimes both to Overwatch 2 in a cadence not too dissimilar from when its predecessor initially launched. Having had a sneak peek at what’s come up in the next few themed seasons, there are definitely some characters, locations, and even ambitious new modes worth looking forward to – with some of the team’s most ambitious ideas yet coming to fruition. It genuinely feels like an exciting time to be an Overwatch fan again, and for that, I’m more than grateful. Given the time to implement all that is scheduled to come to it over the next year, I see no reason why Overwatch can’t reach the dizzying heights that it once did again, if Blizzard plays its cards right. I do have some slight worries about upcoming heroes being part of the premium battle pass tier and not instantly available to all, though. That model pushes that pay-to-win door slightly ajar in the sense that if a new hero is introduced who is particularly powerful or crucial to the evolving meta, then someone can choose to buy their way up the battle pass tiers – something we’ve seen (inadvertently or not) happen with Activision and the introduction of Call of Duty weapons to Warzone. The fact that each hero won’t be available to use in competitive play for the first three weeks of its existence is a fair navigation of this issue, however. Overwatch is a one-of-a-kind hero shooter that is far and away the best of its genre. It offers variety, depth, and style that very few come close to matching. Its four-year-old foundation has been lovingly crafted into the unparalleled multiplayer experience that it offers today. From its now-cherished characters and expertly crafted maps to outstanding sound design and dynamic action, it's a masterpiece of competitive gameplay. Most importantly of all though, it’s never stopped being ridiculously fun after all these years. All of these factors combine to make Overwatch a singularly special shooter, and one that I would recommend to anyone without hesitation. On the flip side, it gives the more casual player something to work toward and a reason (outside of the consistently fun action) to keep playing. This sense of progression is further emphasised for new players, as while all of the original Overwatch’s heroes will be free for them, it will take around 100 matches in order to gradually unlock them all without paying. It’s an approach I don’t think is inherently bad, as a roster of this size can be overwhelming to dive straight into and any easing of the learning curve is welcome. Admittedly, my most-anticipated seasonal content is not due until 2023 – that’s the story-centric PvE modes. The promise of more Overwatch lore is what has had me most excited since the sequel’s reveal, and what could truly set it apart from its predecessor. A steady stream of story-led missions fleshing out a world that Blizzard so impressively built the foundations of years ago is a tantalising prospect, and a far cry from scrambling through comic books and animated shorts for scraps of background information. It’s a shame that none of it has made it in time for launch, but it’s still something I eagerly await nonetheless. So if the pertinent question to ask about Overwatch 2 is simply if it’s a fun game, then the answer right now is yes. It’s still a fundamentally great hero shooter, just one that is perhaps not currently operating at the towering height of its powers. Perhaps that greatness will be recaptured over time, as the community provides feedback through our many victories and defeats to come and Overwatch 2 fulfills the promise of its newly rebuilt foundations. Overwatch 2 breathes new life into what was once the sharpest multiplayer shooter around, before it had its edges severely dulled by Blizzard’s attention shifting away. The switch to smaller 5v5 matches ushers in a new brawler age for Overwatch where individual duels take precedence over tactical team play, and crucially, all but a handful of shields have been thrown out of the arena. The new heroes and maps hit the mark, while Push is one mode that could develop into a fan favourite over time. The fundamentals are all set for Overwatch to shine as it once did in the multiplayer shooter scene once again, and the future definitely looks bright with what is set to come over the following months. I can’t review Overwatch 2 on what it could potentially be though, and instead can only judge what’s in front of me at launch – and that is a very fun team-based FPS, packed full of charm and love for the world it takes place in, and one that I can’t wait to lose hundreds more hours playing in. "
111,urn to Monkey Island ,9.0,"Return to Monkey Island is the adventure game equivalent of Spider-Man: No Way Home. No, wait, don’t go! Hear me out: most would agree that No Way Home is an excellent, very fun movie – even for a kid who’s never seen the Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield Spider-Man films. But if you have made those movie memories with the Peter Parkers of the past, then No Way Home taps into something more: nostalgia, even eliciting genuine emotion at various points. Return to Monkey Island, which very notably puts series creator Ron Gilbert back in the franchise’s director’s chair for the first time in 30 years, is a similar ride. It's a funny, beautiful, polished, and well-paced story packed with plenty of puzzles that are both hilarious and challenging for anybody who appreciates a good adventure game. And Return wisely offers ""Guybrush's Scrapbook"" in the main menu, as a fun, visual way to recap the previous Monkey Island games that's narrated by Guybrush. But for those like me, for whom the earliest Monkey Island games were a formative part of our gaming youth, this reunion with wannabe pirate Guybrush Threepwood feels like coming home. To this end, I loved the not-so-hidden Trivia Cards scattered around many scenes, testing your knowledge of the franchise.  The most obvious way that Return to Monkey Island differs from its predecessors is in its art style. Gilbert could’ve gone the pixel-art route to pluck some extra low-hanging nostalgia fruit, but instead he’s gone with a much bolder modern look. I’ll admit: I didn’t love it when I first saw it. It’s a jarring departure from the games I love, but then again, so was the first post-Gilbert Monkey Island game, the Curse of Monkey Island, which used a Disney-cartoon-like style that I adored. Return’s art direction is more abstract, but somewhere along the 11 hours it took me to complete the story I grew to love it. It uses a large swath of the color palette, and its over-the-top character design matches Monkey Island’s sense of humor nicely. But while you’d never confuse Return to Monkey Island with any other game in the series at a glance, the delightful music could easily fool you into thinking you’re still in 1991. Composers Michael Land, Peter McConnell, and Clint Bajakian return with another pleasantly Caribbean score, and it goes a long way toward making this feel like a proper return to Monkey Island. The same goes with the voice cast, headlined by Dominic Armato as Guybrush Threepwood, who brings a restrained, straight-man sensibility to a game filled with often-absurd scenarios, though he isn’t afraid to sling a bit of sarcasm when the situation calls for it. Everyone in this world knows Guybrush is a well-meaning mess, but they can’t help but root for this hopeless underdog and be friends with him anyway. Armato’s performance is a big reason why I felt the same way; there’s an innocence to Guybrush that shines through. And what of the plot? Return is set just after Monkey Island 2, but it’s framed in a clever way I didn’t expect. That showed me a new side of Monkey Island: its big heart, which becomes quickly evident in the playable Prelude that I won’t spoil here, and keeps getting called back to throughout. Its overarching story involves – what else – the search for the Secret of Monkey Island, and that quest revolves around Guybrush’s never-ending rivalry with the zombie-pirate villain LeChuck, and their love-not-really-a-triangle with Elaine Marley. In fact, Return obsesses over the foundational mystery far more than any of its predecessors did, and it’s played up to repeated comedic effect. Our decades of wondering if Gilbert will ever reveal the real Secret of Monkey Island is mirrored in the game, with even Guybrush’s wife Elaine musing about why our hero continues to cling to it. In the process, it revisits familiar locations like Melee Island and of course Monkey Island, and takes us to new ones; just as it also brings back familiar faces (like Murray!) and introduces a host of new characters. Shout-out to Locke Smith, who you’ll visit on several occasions and who is well aware that her very name is a pun. An excellent story and memorable characters are just one half of the classic puzzle game equation: the other is a series of puzzles that are both challenging and satisfying to solve, serving as the bedrock of any great point-and-click adventure. Return serves up a hearty helping of them here, always including a thread of comedy running through the traditional question of which item you should use on what person or location at every turn. Solving puzzles is as satisfying a dopamine hit as ever, and the 2022 iteration of Monkey Island has learned to avoid the infamously obtuse “adventure game logic” that so often made people bounce off of the originals back in the day. The puzzle structures and solutions don’t really tread new ground, but none were so abstract as to leave me wondering how the heck I’d have ever come up with the solution once I figured it out. And while nothing ever frustrated me to the point of wanting to quit and try again later with a refreshed mind, I did occasionally get a bit stuck in the mud, as is par for the course in these games – such as when I had to use an “apology frog” to win back the favor of Melee Island’s governor, Carla. So I made use of Guybrush’s always-available hint book here and there, and I quickly learned I didn’t need to swallow my pride entirely before resorting to it. It’s a very welcome evolution of a feature first introduced to the series in LucasArts’s 2009 remasters of Monkey Island 1 and 2, and it feels guilt-free to use because it’s not simply a tome of spoilers like using a walkthrough. Instead, it gives you hints layer by layer, nudging you in the right direction but still preserving the feeling of satisfaction you get from eventually solving the puzzle yourself. Only once, in fact, did the hint book tell me something I genuinely didn’t want to know at that moment. The new To-Do List also helps you keep track of everything you’re currently working on trying to solve without making it feel like you’re being led around by the nose.  After decades of believing that we’d never see Gilbert get to make his Monkey Island 3, I was in no way disappointed with Return’s conclusion. In fact, it moved me, and made clear that Gilbert cares as much about these characters as we fans do. I expected Return to Monkey Island to be funny. I expected it to have good and often-zany puzzles and hilarious puzzle solutions. You can see that in its writing, its acquired-taste art style, and its delightfully upbeat music. But I didn’t expect it to have such heart. Monkey Island has been known almost solely for its comedic prowess over the past three decades, but Return reminded me of why I first fell in love with Guybrush Threepwood in a way that will have me thinking about it for a long time. What longtime fans get out of it is definitely going to be markedly different from what newcomers take away from it, but I can say that Return to Monkey Island meant a lot to me before I ever clicked to start a New Game, and it meant far more after the end credits rolled. "
112,Disney Dreamlight Valley Early Access ,8.0,"Where other life sims can sometimes struggle to make interesting use of the characters that occupy their towns, developer Gameloft bursts onto the scene shirtless and flexing its muscles like Maui with Disney Dreamlight Valley. Even in its unfinished early access state, this is an irresistible blend of city planning from the likes of Animal Crossing with quests and a progression system more commonly seen in RPGs. All of that is wrapped inside a Disney theme with an all-star cast of adored characters that make it ridiculously hard to put down. Some tedious quests, copious bugs, and an incomplete final act mean it certainly warrants the early access label at the moment, but it’s already all too easy to lose dozens of hours in this magical simulation. Disney Dreamlight Valley’s cozy concept has you rebuilding a village, befriending iconic characters, and getting sorta creeped out by the look in Mickey Mouse’s eyes. You’ll learn how to fish from Goofy and secretly hope he’s your real father, struggle to find space for all the useless items in your inventory that you absolutely cannot live without, and get really bummed out when you visit Wall-E’s world and remember how sad that movie was. Your ultimate goal is to recruit all the memorable and well-written Disney characters to your town and foster friendships with them, complete a sea of fetch quests to unlock new abilities and access to new areas, and become fabulously wealthy enough to build your Disney dream home in the process. If you’ve played Animal Crossing before, you should feel right at home with Disney Dreamlight Valley – though it isn’t afraid to stray from the well-established loop of farming, fishing, and digging that is the bread and butter of its peers.  The chief differentiator is that Disney Dreamlight Valley wisely focuses far less on the actual village-building and item-collecting elements that are dominant in other games. Instead it relies on its most valuable asset: its characters, who stand front and center as the ultimate unlockable to chase. Completing the right quests to finally convince Moana or Ariel to settle down in my neighborhood provided a hit of dopamine that kept me happily sprinting on the grindy hamster wheel for over 40 hours – not bad for early access. You might not expect a Disney nostalgia simulator where you hang out with a sailor duck and chef rat to try to tell a serious story, but Disney Dreamlight Valley makes just such an attempt – and with more success than I anticipated. That story is dizzyingly meta, but so dang clever I’ve gotta hand it to the devs for their creativity. You enter Dreamlight Valley and quickly learn of a mysterious ailment known as The Forgetting that ravaged the place and caused all the beloved characters to lose their memories; a suitably vague premise that initially made me roll my eyes. Then I began to realize that The Forgetting was actually just an extremely on-the-nose metaphor for my character entering adulthood and leaving behind this imaginary world of their own creation. Rebuilding the town and creating bonds with its characters, then, is an attempt to rediscover my character’s childlike wonder, which (not coincidentally) is exactly what I was doing by reconnecting with these Disney characters. I see what you did there, Gameloft. Just about every activity gives you some kind of meaningful progress, whether it be earning money to upgrade the village or Dreamlight that lets you access new areas and realms, all in pursuit of recruiting more characters and advancing your relationships with them. Of course, you can upgrade your house, buy new furniture and cosmetics, and all that familiar stuff, but it’s hard to beat recruiting your favorite Disney character to become your next-door neighbor as far as incentives go. And by spending time with these characters, you’ll build social links that eventually unlock rewards and quests, the latter of which sometimes result in your character gaining some useful new ability like breaking apart giant ice roadblocks or tearing out troublesome tree stumps. It’s a loop so disgustingly engrossing that I found myself putting off bathroom breaks and ruining my sleep schedule as I told myself “I’ll stop after this one last thing,” time and time again. That said, although chasing new characters and leveling up relationships is endlessly enticing, the actual quests themselves can be a little touch and go. Many of them amount to little more than going out and picking some berries, or crafting a piece of furniture, or cooking some food for someone. Those can often feel like busywork that artificially drag out how long it takes you to unlock your favorite character – even if most don’t actually take very long to complete, they’re usually so similar to one another that it gets repetitive. In a few cases though, quests can be genuinely entertaining in their own right, rather than just a means to an end. In one I chased around a magical feather to divine the location of Donald Duck, who was eternally trapped in a spooky, labyrinthine forest, and in another I helped Anna reunite with Elsa by distracting a giant stone troll in Arendelle. Sadly, these interesting adventures are few and far between amid a sea of much less compelling errands. Again, I was going strong for most of my time with it, but the novelty of this treadmill does slow down toward the end of the adventure. Hopefully this is the part that’s still being worked on to justify the early access label, because it currently seems devoid of meaningful ways to progress. That’s a major shock to the system after being so handsomely rewarded up until this point. For example, the final two areas (which cost the most Dreamlight to access) don’t unlock any new characters and feel largely empty compared to previous ones. And although there’s quite a bit of content to chew on at this early stage – eight distinct environments, four realms, and 17 characters at launch – if it gets its hooks into you as designed you can grind through most of that in a pretty short span of time and be left with little to do aside from log in every day to see what Scrooge McDuck is selling at his store. I’m already excited to revisit Disney Dreamlight Valley once it’s out of early access, but whether or not I’ll continue to play beyond this point before 1.0 depends heavily on if the live-service model will be able to output content frequently enough to keep me engaged. That said, no game must be an endless font of entertainment to be a good time, and in its current state it successfully kept me entertained for 90% of the dozens of hours I put into its journey before ending anticlimactically. Aside from that though, there is some seemingly unintentional timegating that happens which really throws a wrench in an otherwise well-built machine. Unlike real-time games like Animal Crossing that limit your daily progress and ask you to log on every day, Disney Dreamlight Valley sagely sets nearly no limits on how much you can play or accomplish in a single sitting… at least, not on purpose. For example, you can mine ore to your heart’s content, and by the time you’ve left the area to sell off your haul and return, you’ll find the deposits replenished and ready to be mined again – the same can be said for fruit on trees, randomly spawned flowers, and more. But then you’ll run into things like a quest that requires you to collect mushrooms and find no good way to get them except by picking a few that only seem to spawn after reset each day. That effectively adds the same obnoxious timegates to an adventure that seems to have intentionally rid itself of those in other areas, which made them even more out of place and irritating. There are other areas where it doesn’t seem to respect your time, such as crops that take way too long to grow, water-based characters that would swim to places I couldn’t reach them, and, most frustrating of all, characters randomly deciding to sleep in their house and lock me out of it for six real-life hours when I just needed to get in there for a minute to complete a quest. And as of this writing, I am still waiting for some of those accursed mushrooms to appear in the only area that spawns them, with no end in sight. As Dreamlight Valley’s redemption arc plays out, you’ll be treated to a fantastic showcase of the colorful worlds and personalities for which Disney is known. Each character is so impeccably recreated and full of life that hanging out with them gave me flashbacks about parts of the movies that I’d long forgotten. Plus, seeing Donald Duck lose his mind and enter a frenzied rage for no reason just never gets old. All the while, orchestral versions of popular Disney theme music plays in the background and had me humming along like a nostalgia-drunk sucker. The only real letdown, where look and feel is concerned, are the environments – they’re surprisingly claustrophobic and poorly textured compared to how great everything else looks. Granted, that issue is almost a hallmark of the genre at this point, but one that never ceases to gnaw at me as I play nonetheless. Less bland are the character-customization and furniture options you use to decorate the town and your home. I suppose it shouldn’t surprise me that there’s a pile of cosmetics to unlock as big as Gaston’s biceps, seeing as it’s the primary method by which Gameloft plans to make a buck off optional microtransactions when it leaves early access, but it’s still an impressive selection nonetheless. (Unless you wanted to make a redheaded character, in which case for some reason you can only give them ginger eyebrows.) Similarly, the ways in which you can decorate the town and your house are numerous and diverse, and exploring the goods offered by Scrooge’s store became a habit-forming ritual each morning. Once it leaves early access sometime next year, Disney Dreamlight Valley will be a fully free-to-play live-service game with microtransactions baked in to support ongoing content. However, thus far this paid content seems to amount to limited-time events that unlock cosmetics as you complete objectives in the same vein as a season pass. Progress within the season pass can be sped up by paying real money for a premium currency, but aside from that there isn’t any content that’s locked behind a paywall, and the Steam page specifically states that it will have “no monetization mechanisms such as a paid Energy system or gameplay time skipper.” At least in this early state, which requires buying the $30 USD Founder’s Pack to get access, I’m impressed by how mild the microtransaction model is. Also, I’m rarely struck by how good a UI feels to navigate, but Disney Dreamlight Valley unquestionably stands out in this regard. Everything is super easy to find and the all-important collections tab details everything from the unlockables you haven’t discovered yet, to clues for certain ongoing quests that you’ll need to reference. With all of that in mind, it has to be said that Disney Dreamlight Valley feels impressively like a finished product for an early access game. The caveat here, though, is that performance is frequently and brutally murdered like Mufasa (too soon?), sometimes resulting in a painful loss of progress. Some issues are minor, like graphical glitches in which the world temporarily freaks out and turns neon colors for some reason, the camera temporarily develops a mind of its own, or the framerate takes a dive under the sea, but I also hit plenty of crashes or broken states that warranted a hard reset and forced me to repeat whatever I’d done since the last autosave – which was 15 minutes of progress in a few of my cases. These issues are a regular occurrence, too, some of which became insufferably so by the time I saw everything there was to see in my magical valley. Disney Dreamlight Valley is an awesome life simulator that flexes its iconic characters to riveting, satisfying effect. Adding these instantly recognizable villagers to your magical kingdom and forging friendships with them through quests is a blast, even when many of those amount to mundane village errands. Even with a ton of bugs and a missing final act in this early access state, spending 40 hours running around with the gloriously beefy Maui from Moana and cooking meals with Remy from Ratatouille was a consistently delicious treat.

113,JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle R ,7.0,"Since its re-emergence in the anime scene in 2012, JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure has had an upsurge in popularity thanks to its exuberant characters, vibrant worldbuilding, and infinitely memeable moments. In 2013, developer CyberConnect 2 and Bandai Namco released a fighting game based on the long-running manga series to little fanfare. Almost a decade later, a remastered and upgraded version called JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle R looks to make a splash in a fighting game genre that’s become more exciting and crowded in recent years. All Star Battle R comes equipped with some bold new characters, smart updates to the combat system, and a disappointing replacement for the original’s story mode. So in some ways, it succeeds as a celebration of the 35-year history of one of the most exuberant and vibrant anime and manga series out there, but while it remains an entertaining fighting game, its online components still feel archaic in the modern era.   All Star Battle R’s impressive roster spans the entire history of the series - including 10 more fantastical characters than the previous iteration’s already generous 41. Representatives range from Phantom Blood’s Jonathan Joestar and his diabolical adopted brother Dio Brando, to Jonathan’s descendant Jotaro Kujo from the Stardust Crusaders arc, culminating with Josuke from the most recent Jojolion storyline along with allies and foes from every part in between. Trying out each fighter is a joy and exploring the existing lovingly crafted fighting styles with the newly added assist move synergies brings more complexities to combat than possible in the original. Those combined with funny character quirks and interactions fill every match with pleasant surprises. The cherry on top is an update to the Japanese voice cast in All Star Battle R, with actors reprising their roles from the most recent anime adaptations to make these faithful recreations feel complete, and that’s made ample use of in the middle of fights and on each menu screen. All Star Battle R’s Characters come in all shapes and sizes, some of which are not even human! Fighters like the ice-spewing hawk Pet Shop and Stand-wielding doggo Iggy are much smaller combatants than the typical JoJo. Despite their minor stature, their collision detection often matches those who are much larger, making incoming attacks that appear to go over or under the character hit like they were anyone else. It’s not something I am too worried about as a balance issue, but it is worth noting that you might catch some punches and kicks that look a little off. Each era of JoJo has unique abilities and rules for combat, making for battles that are varied and fun to control. Every fighter has a style that fits their placement in the timeline. The first generation of characters, like the Hamon users, can recharge the HH gauge with the hold of a button and use their gauge for stronger special moves. Others have vampiric powers, while those from the Steel Ball Run arc can fight both on and off horseback. It’s wild and wacky, in true JoJo spirit, and that makes matchups exciting. Much of the series’s confrontations gravitate around protective spirits called Stands that act as a second body on the battlefield, and as such, a majority of the cast makes use of this special ability. This may sound a bit homogenous, but characters’ Stands can manifest in assorted and surprising forms, along with differentiating movesets, making every character feel like they have a cool gimmick despite sharing a common battle style.  I appreciate that because, more often than not, learning one character carries over enough information to bridge the gap when trying out another. For instance, no matter who you’re playing as, basic combos are easy to pull off, with light attacks smoothly transitioning into medium and heavy moves. Many of the special attacks are also mapped in similar ways across characters, making it easy to pick up for beginners no matter who they want to try. Speaking of beginners, Easy Beat is a great tool for new players to use to jam out simple combos using only the light attack button – until they learn how to piece moves together on their own, that is. I have had a great time swapping between the characters I love from the anime and then switching to later JoJo heroes and antagonists to see what kinds of wacky gameplay schemes they abide by.  After you’ve taken that smooth onramp to playing All Star Battle R, there are plenty of advanced skills to learn to maximize your effectiveness on the battlefields. For example, battles play out mostly on a 2D plane, but the dodge button allows a character to dash into the foreground or background to avoid an oncoming onslaught; learning to do this is vital to open up counterattack opportunities and punish aggressive advances. Likewise, the more advanced Stylish Evade can turn last-second blocks into a time-slowing dodge, and getting the hang of it requires precise timing and intuition of what the opponent’s next attack may be. Assist characters selected from any roster member can also be called in to provide mixups, extend combos, or save you from a beating you may be taking. Even taunts serve an important function  by draining the opponent’s resource gauge with appropriately timed trash talk. For those looking to get extra fancy, you can also spend a bar of meter to cancel the recovery of moves to either continue combos or make certain moves safe on block, much like a Roman Cancel in Guilty Gear. Learning when and how to use each of these skills is rewarding and drastically extends the depth of strategy and gameplay in All Star Battle R.  JoJo’s exhibits a flagrant disregard for rules - both visual and mechanical - and for that, I truly love it. It can, at times, seem completely alien and imbalanced, but even then, it manages such consummate showmanship, it’s difficult to fault it too harshly. It is by no means a comprehensive, or polished fighting game, but it is a uniquely enjoyable one; exhibiting rare style and creativity in battle, even as it struggles to meet the standards set by other modern fighters.  Because of the timing of All Star Battle R’s release, its visuals are largely based on JoJo creator Hirohiki Araki’s manga art style and is presented with a wonderful comic book aesthetic, including speech bubbles and dramatic comic panels. The colorful hand-drawn textures and impossible poses for each character model are wonderful to look at, even if some of the models and stages are starting to show their age in 2022. Most of All Star Battle R’s offline modes are solid, if unremarkable, but many kept me happily grinding matches for hours. Of course, arcade and one-on-one versus modes are expected in any fighter, and these activities are available here without any surprising elements. However, exciting additions such as a King of Fighters-like 3v3 team battle and support for tournament brackets you can play with up to eight people offer great ways to get together with friends and duke it out in person. These modes should be staples in modern fighting games, and I applaud their inclusion here.  The primary single-player attraction is All Star Battle mode, which features canonical melees and hypothetical dream matches to see which JoJo from different eras would win if they came to blows. What I like most about these fights are the special conditions like giving you and your computer-controlled opponent increases or penalties to attributes like special gauge recovery, defense, or attack power. Certain boss-like characters may also start in a more challenging state, making many of the battles exciting and difficult confrontations to overcome. While All Star Battle mode contains many fights from the JoJo manga and anime, there’s not much to learn here about the plot of the series. Unfortunately, it leaves anybody who’s new to JoJo completely in the dark as to what is happening in the story, who the main characters are, and why these fights are important. The original’s story mode is nowhere to be found here, which means that one of the remaster’s biggest missed opportunities is in the storytelling – or lack thereof. All there is is a glossary filling in some info on important items and characters hidden in the menus, but it serves better as a reminder to lapsed fans than a guide to the greatness of JoJo.  That’s not to say JoJo’s signature flavor is nowhere to be found; it’s alive and well on the battlefield. Explosive super moves known as Heart Heat and Great Heat Attacks unleash devastating combinations that are paired with ridiculous and flashy animations and voice lines. Some of the best of these include Dio pulverizing a steamroller (a classic), Diego transforming into a Jurassic terror, and Akira Otoshi shredding on his guitar while his Stand pummels their foe.  Where things go downhill for JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle R is in its considerably lacking online play. Not only are the standout parts of offline competition missing, like team battles and tournaments, but remote matches are also limited to strictly 1v1 matchmaking without the option for group lobbies. On top of that, while some matches play out just fine online, matches with any network slowdown can turn brawls into a constantly hitchy mess. That’s a real mood killer, especially in an age where online play is more popular than ever, and competing fighting games such as Guilty Gear Strive or Capcom Fighting Collection are flexing a much better online infrastructure with modern rollback netcode.  I wish it were only connection problems, but there are more issues with online play. Entering into a ranked match is an exercise in navigating unintuitive menus, which made the simple task of selecting my preferred character confusing and frustrating. This annoying mode was also responsible for competitions where it lost my customized button scheme simply because I matched up in the 2P position. It’s great to have JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle represented on modern hardware with an improved combat system over its 2013 version. Its online implementation desperately needs an upgrade, though, and the crucial story context from the anime is nearly nonexistent. Still, All Star Battle R makes a strong case for itself in its raucous cast, accessible yet complex combat, and its set of solid – if safe – offline modes. It’s not the best fighting game out there, but for those who’re heavily invested in JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, it’s one we’re glad to have on hand for a good time. "
114,Steelrising ,6.0,"You know that one soulslike game that is a decent enough take on the genre, but also has a bit of wonkiness that otherwise holds it back? Sorry, did you think I was talking about Lords of the Fallen, or maybe Mortal Shell? Or perhaps you thought I meant The Surge, Ashen, Vampyr, or Remnant: From The Ashes – or even Thymesia from earlier this month? No, in this case I was referring to Steelrising, a French Revolution-themed action-RPG that’s chock full of creepy robots, emotionally unstable aristocrats in powdered wigs, and death screens that tell you you’re dead. The unfathomably weird setting is a delight, but simplistic combat and underwhelming boss fights end up making disappointing use of it. That means in the long list of recent serviceable soulslikes with lots of rough edges, Steelrising is… well, another one of those. Set in a bizarre alternate history version of the French Revolution where Louis XVI has crushed his would-be usurpers using monstrous robots, you play as Aegis, a stoic dancing robot turned lone warrior who has to face the king’s mechanical army. Everything about the setting is incredibly weird in the best possible way: all the robo-folk take design cues from old school clockwork machines of the time period, you spend a lot of time hanging out with actual French revolutionaries like Lafayette and Robespierre, and Marie Antoinette herself serves as your boss and chief quest-giver, which never stops feeling super strange (but I’m into it). The roughly 15-hour campaign tells a pretty predictable “down with the king” story that has you turning increasingly dangerous metal machinations into scrap, but the peculiar setting and characters help make that journey mostly enjoyable.  The hit-or-miss voice acting for its historical figures is shored up by some great writing and interesting side missions as you assemble a group of renegades to help you fight the king. For example, a charismatic revolutionary will ask you to help him in his fight to end slavery, and a side quest later on lets you rob the king’s treasury and then decide which of two opposing political causes you’d like to use those funds to support, complete with dialogue options to pick from. Some of these decisions affect the outcome of the story in major ways, which was a welcome surprise in a genre that usually relies heavily on cryptic environmental storytelling. Plus, Steelrising isn’t afraid to touch on some interesting philosophical and political topics like dictatorships, the consequences of bloody insurrections, and some surprising late-game story developments that I won’t spoil here. Cutting down robots is fun and all, but I quite enjoyed taking a break from the action to debate politics with my French compatriots from time to time. Between those moments, Steelrising does still place most of its focus on the tried and true recipe of fighting your way through areas filled with deadly enemies in hopes of reaching the next save point before eventually killing a big, scary boss. All the expected chords are struck here, including respawning enemies when reaching save points, losing your primary resource upon death (called “anima essence” in this case), and third-person hack-and-slash combat that has you dodging around and using limited consumables to recover health. It’s a formula that’s all too familiar, and although I’m a fan of soulslikes, it’s still a bit eyebrow-raising how remarkably little this iteration does to set itself apart from all the other options we have nowadays. An unoriginal idea can still be executed in exciting ways, but Steelrising doesn’t completely nail some of the game mechanics it tries to replicate either. Combat is a fairly one-note contest of dodging and slicing with a few status ailments, special moves, and weapon types thrown in to jazz things up. There are certainly some interesting weapon options, many of which have special abilities associated with them that might let you block or fire a weapon from afar in addition to its melee strikes. That includes the fire chain, which lets you ignite enemies from a distance in style, as well as the nimble glass-core batons, which I relied on extensively to freeze and then wail on my enemies. However, swinging those weapons is frequently imprecise, and combat can feel downright janky at times as a result. The all-important dodging mechanics feel smooth and responsive at least, but enemies often waddle around and simply let you kill them, and I sometimes got stuck on pieces of the environment at the worst moments. Plus, the age-old problem of a terrible camera that floats through objects and obscures your view is likely to cause issues on a regular basis. The robotic opponents you fight along the way come in a few creative varieties, from small and weak humanoids to enormous foes that carry around building support columns as weapons. There are also some cool robotic dogs, freaky snake-like creatures, and even some murderous musicians who kill you with brass instruments like you’ve always dreamt they would. Each of these enemies has their own bag of tricks to learn, and facing off against them initially accounts for some of Steelrising’s best moments. Unfortunately, once you’ve fought these motorized baddies a few times, you won’t find many surprises ‘round the bend. There just aren’t many types beyond what I’ve mentioned here, with most others being slight variations of one another that hardly impact how you approach different combat scenarios. Bosses are even worse as many are just beefier versions of existing enemy types – the much more unique “Titan” bosses do provide a boost of variety, but they’re so laughably easy to defeat that you’re likely to wipe the floor with one and then not think about it again. Steelrising never really falls entirely flat on its face in any of these attempts, so the things it doesn’t try to do are what really what take it from passably enjoyable to underwhelming. Its alternate history theme is exceptionally creative, but it seems so afraid to break from the soulslike script elsewhere that I practically started recognizing sections from other games. There were times when I would walk into a room and instinctively know an enemy was going to lunge out at me from the ceiling, or that I would find an item hidden in a dangling bag I had to strike. That familiarity means there aren’t any real surprises to be found, and the adventure ends up largely feeling like it’s trying to parrot stuff I’ve already played rather than chart its own course. Those levels also try their hand at a bit of platforming, as you unlock a midair dash and a grappling hook that you’ll sometimes be required to use to get through levels, but this addition is unfortunately not very well executed either. For one, the camera issues often mean you’ll get turned around while dashing through a tight gap or be staring up at a grappling point hoping it decides to lock on to the spot you’re trying to leap to – an issue that’s much more frustrating if you’re being mobbed by nearby enemies. But Steelrising seemingly doesn’t actually want to trust you with these abilities either, as it sometimes locks you out of areas you should theoretically be able to access using these powers. For example, if you find a spot to dash over a wall and the developers have arbitrarily decided you shouldn’t have access to that place yet, you’ll run into an invisible barrier. This completely took the steam out of my engine every time it happened to me, as it makes things feel needlessly linear. That’s a bummer when its hub worlds are otherwise a lot of fun to explore. As you travel around various areas of France, you’ll be treated to some really cool sights, including a few notable places like the Bastille or Versailles – all of which have gone full-dystopia in light of their current automaton occupation. Even when some of Steelrising’s rough edges hampered the experience, the sprawling historical settings continued to impress. I got to fight my way down the ruined cobblestone streets of 1789 Paris and murder a giant robot’s dumb face in the courtyard of a gorgeous castle, and that’s not a bad way to spend an afternoon. Of course, it wouldn’t be a by-the-numbers soulslike if it weren’t also prone to some bugs, and Steelrising has plenty to share with you. During the course of my adventure I got stuck on invisible objects, stopped being able to see enemy health bars for hours at a time, and even crashed to the Xbox dashboard at times (presumably because it just couldn’t handle my combat prowess). None of these issues are so rampant that I wanted to rage quit, but they certainly don’t do any favors for a game that already feels unpolished at times.  Steelrising is a competent action-RPG with an unforgettable setting, but it’s dragged down by its humdrum soulslike formula that doesn’t do anything to make its combat or exploration stand out. Despite having some memorable weapons and enemies, combat often feels imprecise or sloppy, and boss fights are largely forgettable. That said, even if the story is fairly straightforward, the recognizable faces from history you meet and the beautiful French vistas you find them can still help make fighting robots in an alternate history somewhat entertaining. "
115,F1 Manager 2022 ,8.0,"A good sports management game shouldn’t just accurately represent the sport on the cover; it also needs to show some personality. It needs to be a storyteller. In any sports organisation – as time, championships, seasons, and people come and go – their story grows and changes, building a folklore and a history that makes them unique and loved by their fans. It’s what gives them an identity. F1 Manager 2022, despite being a first attempt at the genre by Frontier Developments, is definitely a storyteller; one that will help you shape the future and history of any current Formula 1 team into one of your own making. Despite its quirks and the fact that it’s missing some features that experienced sim fans might expect, F1 Manager 2022 is more than worth the long, 22-year wait since EA’s similarly named, but unrelated, F1 Manager.   Gameplay is split between two main themes: the race weekends, and the management screens in between them. The latter is where you’ll field emails, start design and manufacturing projects to help improve the performance of your car, manage your race team staff and drivers, upgrade and do maintenance on the team’s facilities, and more. It’s certainly got a learning curve and can feel a little fumbly at first, but the impact of your choices feel immediate. Then it’s off to the excitement of the race weekends, which see you jetting around each of the 22 circuits that make up the Formula 1 World Championship, managing your cars and drivers through practice, qualifying, and the race itself. Moving between race weekends and the factory feels good, too, with the post-race analysis acting as a nice moment to decompress after the excitement and stress of managing a team through a Grand Prix. The opening few screens in F1 Manager 2022 can feel overwhelming to begin with, which isn’t unexpected in any management game – but it’s especially true for one that’s wrapped in the fast-paced world of Formula 1. There’s an abundance of icons and sub-menus to dig through where you’ll find enough data to satisfy even the most passionate of bedroom analysts and engineers. It gets very deep into the weeds, but none of it feels like filler; every screen has something useful you can use to help make informed decisions about where your team needs work, like in the car parts screen where you can view a detailed analysis of your cars’ raw performance numbers with new and old parts, or see its expected place on the grid compared to the other teams. It doesn’t throw you straight into deep and prolonged explanations of what you’re looking at either, unless you go digging for them. Instead, it helpfully grabs you by the hand from the beginning and offers you a simple path forward to a race weekend, which is where the majority of your time in F1 Manager 2022 is spent. After the first race is where you’re encouraged to look around some more, with each screen briefly but helpfully explained through a fully-voiced tutorial.  Race weekends are busy and lively affairs, with three one-hour sessions of practice followed by another three sessions of elimination qualifying – and then, finally, the race. Sprint races, a format introduced to the real-world series in 2021, are sadly missing, and it’s disappointing they’re not included given how they’ve shaken up the qualifying format since their introduction. Each session can be run in real time if you’ve got a few hours to burn, but you can also fast-forward time up to 16x speed to move things along in the quieter sessions. It can be tempting to lean on this a lot during a dull race – especially because it is so good about slowing everything down when your attention is needed – but I urge you to slow down a bit because you’d be missing half the fun in skipping ahead. When your drivers are out on the track, there are three different views that give you more information than you’d find on the Ferrari pit wall. There’s the Strategy view, where you can see data on the state of the track, the condition of the car and all of its critical parts, the weather conditions, and the predicted weather for the remainder of the session. Weather plays a huge part in Formula 1 race strategy, and predicting which tyres you should have on and the best time to stop and change them can gain you a huge advantage in a race. That said, it could be better at pointing some of these options out dynamically, either by suggesting things directly or analysing those opportunities after the race so you can be better at spotting them.  Then you have the Data view where you can dig into the finer details of sector times and tyre stats and other various statistics from the current session. This section is more informational than anything, offering an overloaded picture of everything that’s happened in the race up until that point. It mostly comes in use alongside the Strategy view for working out gaps between the cars you’re racing, and seeing the chances of other teams taking an extra pit stop. There’s almost too much on display here, and it needs some kind of customisation so you can really focus in on the details you need at that moment. Lastly, but most importantly, the Race view lets you tap into the various cameras placed around the track, as well as the onboard cameras available on each car. It’s where you’ll watch the majority of the on-track action as it happens. You can direct your drivers when to push or save their tyres and manage fuel and ERS battery use, and while this can feel a bit overkill to begin with, it makes a lot more sense when in the context of a race. If you notice one driver is pushing their tyres too hard, order them to back off and you can avoid a costly late race pitstop. It doesn’t feel like you’re coaching your drivers, but rather gently advising them on how to maximise their chances – and miraculously, this never falls into feeling like micromanagement. Each circuit feels lovingly recreated from their real-life counterparts, from the sun-drenched desert surrounding the Bahrain International Circuit and the glinting seas and packed-out harbour that laps the shores of the Circuit de Monaco to the brand-new tarmac of the Miami International Circuit, under the shade of the Hard Rock Stadium in the Miami Gardens. Track and weather conditions also look great; clouds roll in and cast shadows over the track when rain threatens to dampen proceedings, and day noticeably turns to night during late afternoon sessions with the bright-orange sun brilliantly washing the ground in harsh light as the circuit lights slowly take over. Despite some excessive blooming and a few flickering artefacts here and there, it’s both impressive and immersive enough to pull me into the action on screen. On track sessions are mostly well-presented thanks to both the impressive cars and tracks and the surprising detail of using the same TV-style camera placement as they use at the real-life races. On the other hand, the accompanying commentary from Sky Sports F1 presenters David Croft and Karun Chandhok leaves a lot to be desired. Both of them come off sounding like they’re reading through forced smiles while under duress, though mercifully these scenes can be skipped and you can dive straight into preparing your cars for your first session. On that subject, it’s a shame there’s no media or fan interaction to speak of, given how important the relationship a team has with its fans can be when determining sponsorships, team morale, and more in real life.  Any practice or qualifying session can be left in the hands of your team, and they’ll handle all the necessary race preparation work. However, taking control of practice yourself will help you find that extra bit of performance that your team usually can’t. In the garage, the simple slider system means you don’t need a mechanical engineering degree to see what changes you’re making and how they’re affecting other things, with your driver's feedback also clearly visible. Each change is a compromise to something else and finding the right balance is key to extracting the best performance; seeing the payoff in performance is more than satisfying enough to make it worth the time. With its typically deep and rich career mode and its usual class-leading spectrum of assists and difficulty options, F1 22 maintains this series’ run as the most fully-featured and accessible reproduction of a single modern motorsport on the market – and long-awaited tweaks to some of its most reused elements haven’t gone unnoticed, either. It’s not quite as bold as F1 2021, though, and the footwear-and-furniture-focussed F1 Life mode really isn’t a patch to cover the lack of last year’s ambitious story mode. As the late former voice of Formula 1, Murray Walker, once famously said, “Anything can happen in Formula 1 and it usually does,” and F1 Manager 2022 brings that same level of excitement and uncertainty, albeit in its own unique and sometimes awkward way. The racing action can be just as thrilling to sit and watch as a real race, although it can veer into “Hot Wheels with your brother” territory when you see cars softly park themselves in the barrier, or when there’s an almighty smashup under a shower of sparks and debris before both cars roll away back to the pits like their drivers didn’t just have the biggest accident of their lives.  But the almost slot-car-like AI racing on display still produces the same storylines and on-track rivalries we see in real life, and it's here where F1 Manager 2022 finds its stride. Is your driver faster than the cars in front but stuck in a DRS train? Why not pit them a little earlier, giving them a tyre advantage and see if they can leapfrog them during the pitstop phase of the race? Or perhaps you’ve noticed there’s some rain on the way and want to gamble on going to wet tyres before anyone else. As different race strategies unfold and events take place, watching the field shuffle about with drivers jostling for position and scouring through the data screens looking for any kind of advantage is a real thrill, particularly when a risky strategy call pays off. F1 is full of unique sounds, and F1 Manager 2022’s audio feels nicely authentic thanks to some awesome trackside and onboard engine sounds, plus the inclusion of real driver and race engineer chatter for some added immersion. During any session each race engineer will communicate with their driver, providing feedback on car setup, track conditions, and any incidents happening in their path. Pierre Gasly swears and shouts down the radio whenever his tyres are nearing the end of their life, while Alex Albon’s awkward charm comes across even in short spurts of radio banter. Even its roster of Formula 2 and Formula 3 junior drivers, who will replace the eventually ageing F1 field as they near retirement in later seasons, have some voiced radio. While there’s not as much variety for each as I’d like – it can get annoying when they use the same complaints over and over again – hearing the real drivers' voices adds a layer of authenticity that I didn’t know I wanted until I heard it. When the dust settles on a race weekend you’ll head back to the factory to decompress and look ahead to the next race, as well as anything else that can get done before you’re off to another full weekend. This can range from checking your spare parts in the warehouse to ordering emergency parts to be built before the next grand prix, starting research projects on improving next year’s car, and a lot more.  How you go about this will be mostly dictated by the stature of the team you start your career with. A team like Williams, for example, has the worst car, is resource poor, and needs better staff and facilities before you can start thinking about bolting on new parts for increased performance. Here you might look to first improve the base facilities to give the team some much-needed development and performance bonuses to build confidence, or maybe invest heavily into next year’s car so you can start challenging for points positions instead of battling away for pride in the lower half of the field. Whereas a team like Red Bull already has a car it expects to challenge for the championship with, so you can focus all your resources on gaining all the extra performance you can find. Despite all aiming for the same ultimate goal of winning, it’s refreshing to know that each team will require a unique touch to progress.  Everything you do in F1 Manager 2022 is to please the almighty board, who sit upon high in their fancy-shmancy board room and set your expectations for both the following season and longer-term goals they'll want you to have achieved at some point in the future. You can get away with failing to meet your goals for a little while but, like any boss, if you let them down for too long and fail your board reviews they’ll bring down the hammer: you’ll be given less and less budget to play with before being asked to leave the building and find a new job. The opposite is also true; impress them enough and your budget will soar, opening up new avenues of investment for you to explore.  Money doesn’t solve every problem, though. Once you’re near the top and pulling in the big bucks F1’s cost cap regulations reign in overspending, so forget about throwing your abundance of millions at any one problem. Upgraded facilities aren’t bulletproof – they degrade over time and lose effectiveness, needing costly refurbishing to bring them back up to standard. If you’ve got crash-happy drivers, emergency spare parts can quickly churn through a limited budget. This beautifully twists what would normally be a huge advantage of having all the cash in the world into another point of tension, so you can never truly get too comfortable with your progress.  Key staff will helpfully monitor and report through emails on their areas of responsibility so you’ll never miss out on important information, like when the design team has finished work on a new part or when you have a driver that will soon be out of contract. They can also help you decide which direction to take car development, identifying weaknesses for improvement. But when it comes to making and acting on these key decisions you’re given free reign to accept or ignore this advice as you please. The comparison data for every car on the grid is there, which is admittedly a little unusual given how secretive F1 teams really are, but I appreciate that you aren’t led down any certain path. There’s no one right way to the top, and F1 Manager 2022 feels like it strikes the right balance between guiding novices in the right direction while not standing in the way of those who want to forge their own path to glory. Even after my worst race results, where everything fell apart at the seams despite having what I felt was a concrete strategy and top-line drivers, I never walked away from a session in F1 Manager 2022 without a dumb smile on my face. Sure, sometimes the racing can look a little robotic and there are some key facets of modern F1 racing that are missing entirely, but this never detracts from the thrill of watching my drivers cross the line for some hard-earned points or their first-ever podium. The excitement and thrill of Formula 1 is here in spades. "
116,Ooblets ,7.0,"Have you ever moved to a new town and, what do you know, there’s an abandoned farm ready for you to claim and revitalize all on your own? With adorable creatures to collect and eccentric townsfolk to befriend,  Ooblets doesn’t follow a completely unfamiliar formula. But while the unique twists it adds to that structure aren’t very deep, they did keep me smiling for the roughly 30 hours it took to finish the main story.   You arrive as the newest citizen of Badgetown, a down-on-its-luck community you immediately start working to improve that lives in harmony with charming creatures called Ooblets. Though they’re all little and very cute, their designs vary pretty widely. You have Ooblets like Dumbirb, an actual small birb… bird friend; Clomper, a round, fluffy puppy-looking chum with stick horns; and Firmo, one of a few robots on the roster.   Rather than being caught, you grow your own Ooblets right out of the ground, who will then act as your cutie-patootie farm assistants. Of course, they serve a higher purpose than that too – Ooblets are also used to battle on your behalf in order to earn new Ooblet seeds or to solve a plethora of local problems. Violence isn’t the answer in Ooblets though – dance battles are. It’s a clever twist that removes the questionable ethics present in some other monster collecting games. Unfortunately, the dance battles themselves never evolved enough to live up to their creative theming. Battles play out as card-based fights, where different cards represent fanciful moves your Ooblets can perform, with silly names like Takey Tap Tap or One Step Pep. Each Ooblet has its own set of signature move cards, which makes collecting all the different species extra fun as I never knew when a new game-changing card would be held by the widdle Ooblet I just found. That also means constructing a party is like a roundabout way of building a deck, but there’s less choice than in similar games since you can’t alter the generic cards that make up the bulk of it. I often found fantastic synergy between the signature cards of two Ooblets, but some other moves simply contributed to deck bloat that made any cool combos inconsistent. Purchasable cards are also permanently unlocked and can never be removed from your deck once they’re added, making that problem potentially worse as you progress. This wasn’t a huge issue during my first story playthrough since dance battles were always easy or manageable, and I never memorized every Ooblet’s signature moves well enough to accurately prepare counters anyway, but not being able to fine-tune my “deck” was still frustrating. A fun enough my-first-deck-builder, but not quite up to snuff for someone who’s put hundreds of hours into dedicated games of the genre.   Thankfully there’s a lot more to Ooblets than just dance battling, so the shallow deck-building doesn’t detract from the whole experience. In fact, battles themselves are often the literal fruit of your labor on your farm. To get a new Ooblet seed, you need to find that Ooblet out in the world, then bribe it into a dance battle by giving it the specific items it demands. After claiming victory, you can tell the opponent they did a good job, and it will toot out a seed for you to grow a new friend. This system encouraged – no, demanded – that I keep up on unlocking new recipes and growing new crops on my farm, or else I might miss out on getting a cool new friend, as well as an opportunity to make some cash. Welcoming a new Ooblet meant I could scan it to add to the almanac and earn Gummies, Ooblets’ currency. Each Oooblet has three variations, too–common, uncommon, and Gleamy–all of which you can turn in for increasing amounts, making it wise to stay stocked on duplicates of each enticing item I discovered. I can’t tell you how many times I stumbled upon a rare Gleamy Ooblet (its equivalent of Pokemon’s Shinies), then excitedly scrambled to grow or craft the item it demanded before it disappeared at the end of the day. Glob, I struggled hard finding the Soggy Bread recipe in time to battle this dang pink Gleamy Bibbins. But it’s gorgeous, so, worth it! You can even give it a matching bow tie!  I played Ooblets on Nintendo Switch, and it’s worth quickly talking about its performance on the system. Despite the occasional hiccup, particularly at transitions between battles or talking to people, it held up okay. That is, until one particular, late game zone I don’t want to spoil. You don’t have to spend much time there and I imagine it’s a beautiful area on other systems, but it stuttered so badly on Switch it made me nauseous. The Switch just can’t handle blades of grass blowing in the wind, I guess. There are some console-specific bugs and overlooked details as well, like not being able to use the ZR or ZL buttons to tab through menus while the Switch is docked for some reason, but the developers at least seem to be aware and hopefully those issues will be patched out in the future. I appreciate Ooblets’ well thought out interconnecting systems, which made every task rewarding in its own way, no matter how menial. And there are a lot of tasks. Tinstel Tasks are the main “quests” given by the Mayor (yes, she’s a child) that benefit Badgetown in some way. There are so many micro-tasks that may or may not support these – like maintaining your farm, decorating your house, partaking in Dance Barn dance battles, etc. – that I sometimes struggled with time and energy-management, as one does in farming games where time passes and stamina must be managed. But that also meant I was rarely bored while playing Ooblets, and found myself easily sucked into the flow of completing odd jobs to accomplish bigger goals for hours. All of these mechanics are accompanied by sickenly adorable, offbeat dialogue and writing that I got a huge kick out of at first. It’s not fishing, it’s SEA DANGLIN’. This isn’t a pepper, it’s a SPICYSPEAR. Coffee? No, BEANJUICE. I could go on, but trust me when I say I was all smiles and laughter at the absurdity of it all, and desperately wanted to point out all of the shenanigans to my housemates, like that time I got an instrument and tooted my way around town to harass my neighbors.  The townsfolk say the darndest things, making their dialogue a reward for talking to them enough on its own. But talking to people also “levels up” their relationship with you, prompting them to gift you with a friendship sticker, unique clothes, Ooblet accessories, or even useful items each time. Multiple incentives are very splenda, as the locals would say. Eventually though, the novelty of that cuteness did wear off a bit. That was especially true during one particularly long and slow lull of near non-progression where I thought I’d be stuck in Badgetown for the entire campaign. I found it very difficult to make the money I needed to continue during this stretch, with my poverty only solved by collecting Spicyspears so I could craft and sell Hop Hop Hop Dobs at a high net profit. That may sound like gibberish, but it was a rough blip in the pacing to be sure.  You do eventually get to go to uniquely themed locations, like the extra spooky Nullwhere or the boardwalk town of Port Forward  as part of the slowly rolled-out story. Some of the objectives in these places seem copy-pasted between each other, like having you win a series of dance battles, which even your character jokes about. But one of the more unique ones involved beating a silly caricature of a gamer bro’s high-scores in a series of arcade-like minigames, which I delighted in. On the complete opposite end, however, another area involved literally climbing up and down a plain mountain path repeatedly, which bored the heck out of me. That makes the campaign a bit hit-and-miss, but the loose, overarching storyline does culminate into some funny, biting satire by the end that I won’t ruin. Everything in Ooblets is downright adorable, from the cheeky dialogue to the unique dance battles to the well-designed creatures themselves. That charm was enough to draw me in from the get go and keep a gleeful smile on my face for most of the 30-hour story. But while I could easily see myself going back to improve my farm, home, and Ooblets collection a while longer, the actual mechanics behind those tasks don’t have much to dig into past their skin-deep sense of style. That means Ooblets is an amusing farm battler, just not a very exciting one. "
117,The Last of Us Part I ,9.0,"You almost have to admire the hedonism of looking at The Last of Us Remastered, which is still visually impressive eight years later, and saying, “Yeah, that looks pretty good, but we can do better.” There’s very little left to be said about the original The Last of Us, a potent, post-apocalyptic cocktail of stealth, survival, and slaughter that’s revered for its haunting storytelling in an amazingly well-crafted world. You almost certainly knew that. It’s widely lauded as one of the best games of all time and one of the few to get a 10 from IGN, but I reckon you knew that, too. In fact, it’s a game so nice they built it thrice, which is where we find ourselves with The Last of Us Part I – now the third version of Naughty Dog’s 2013 masterpiece to arrive inside a decade. Unsurprisingly, this remake takes full advantage of the added grunt afforded to it by the PS5 by delivering astonishing new levels of detail and fluidity in its fully rebuilt world, characters, and animations. It's also equipped with some subtle but well-considered use of the haptic feedback in the DualSense controller, and a simply remarkable array of accessibility options. It’s missing the original’s multiplayer mode, but the result is undoubtedly the definitive way for solo players to experience this modern classic. Even so, there is something inherently inessential about it that it can’t quite shake, as a remake of an already fabulous remaster that remains a must-play on hardware only a single generation old.  Make no mistake: the story here in both the main game and the short prequel, Left Behind (which is included in Part I, still as a separate story), remains as strong, as captivating, and as shocking as it ever was. If you’ve yet to play it, The Last of Us is a tangled bramble of themes, but Naughty Dog weaves them together expertly. It may trade in despair, selfishness, and misery, but it’s also quick to lightly breathe on the embers of hope, redemption, and love that glow within its darkness. The upshot is an unforgettable journey that I still can’t recommend highly enough. Of course, if you’re familiar with the story already, know that I really enjoyed watching it unfold all over again – from its harrowing opening chapter to its bruising final moments. Playing again actually confirmed to me a suspicion I’ve held since playing The Last of Us Part II: that the original remains superior over its sequel in terms of its story. The Last of Us Part II is a technically outstanding follow-up with a fascinating tale of its own that completely immersed me, but it’s an almost exclusively grim one, and the heavy spotlight on revenge, hate, and self-destruction is exhausting and disillusioning in a way the original is not. At least, not all the time.  The Last of Us Part II is a masterpiece worthy of its predecessor. Taking strides forward in nearly every way, Ellie steps into the spotlight and carries the sequel in a manner that feels like the culmination of everything that’s made Naughty Dog’s blockbuster storytelling so memorable since the original Uncharted on the PlayStation 3. It delivers a layered, emotionally shattering story on top of stealth and action gameplay that improves the first game’s mechanics while integrating a bit more of Uncharted’s greater mobility and action. But while Part II is a thrilling adventure, it still makes time for a stunning, nuanced exploration of the strength and fragility of the human spirit. The PlayStation 4 has one of its best exclusives in one of the generation’s best games.  For clarity, The Last of Us Part I has been positioned as a complete rebuild for PS5 – a remake, and not a remaster. Despite some hand-wringing to the contrary, this does feel mostly true. While The Last of Us Part I features two display modes – one that achieves native 4K at a targeted 30 frames per second, and another that presents dynamic 4K at a targeted 60 frames per second – Naughty Dog has done much more here than simply dial up the resolution and crank out an increased framerate. Our full performance review of The Last of Us Part I goes into much more technical detail, but broadly speaking all the characters and environments have been remade entirely, and it does show. While I’d agree that it’s been tough to see a vast gulf between 2014’s The Last of Us Remastered and The Last of Us Part I in the video comparisons Sony has been rationing out, I will caution that watching two cutscenes smooshed together on a smartphone screen probably isn’t the best way to appraise the meaningful differences here. In-game there’s definitely an overt leap in fidelity and quality. I opted for the dynamic 4K/60FPS performance mode and toggled off the film grain, as the higher frame rate makes for far, far smoother camera panning and the default grain effect honestly does little but obscure how good everything actually looks on the PS5. Among the most noticeable changes are the facts that foliage is denser, destructible objects are more abundant, and reflections are a standout. The soft lighting is also absolutely stunning, and it’s brimming with details so granular you’ll miss them if you don’t look closely enough. The way rain drizzles down Joel’s rifle and snakes down his wet shirt before dripping realistically off the bunched parts of his sleeves had me stopped in my tracks, as did how the light picks up airborne dust and spores in the dankest levels. It’s an absolutely top-shelf visual showcase of what the PlayStation 5 is capable of. There have been some moderate redesigns for a couple of key characters, too – most notably Joel’s smuggling partner, Tess. I’ve seen some resistance to the updated Tess, but I think it’s a minor but smart change. Crafting a Tess that more authentically appears to be a woman in her 40s rather than her 20s paints her more as a generational peer of Joel’s, rather than a woman younger than his own daughter would have been 20 years after the outbreak. The faint hint of a relationship between the two that perhaps hasn’t always been entirely platonic makes way more sense in this context, and the later bond between Joel and Ellie is made all the more special when it’s clearer it’s not the kind of connection Joel could’ve made with Tess previously. The Last of Us Part I does, however, lean on the exact same performance capture, voice acting, and cutscene direction that was used for the original PS3 version, Tess included. Admittedly, they have been touched up, and I do appreciate how the ultra-high level of facial detail has allowed Naughty Dog to extract even more subtle microexpressions from the cast’s performances. Even the small addition of flecks of spit shooting from a character’s mouth as they shout adds a new layer of intensity to the drama that I admire. It’s a testament to just how high-quality and future proof it all was in the 2013 original that there was simply no need to redo these story sequences wholesale, but it does mean I wouldn’t necessarily group The Last of Us Part I in quite the same category as rescripted, wall-to-wall do-overs like 2019’s Resident Evil 2 remake or 2020’s Mafia: Definitive Edition.   The Last of Us Part I’s new range of accessibility options isn’t something I can personally appraise with the appropriate authority, but it is a tremendously extensive list and an evolution of the multitude of options available in The Last of Us Part II. There are high contrast modes for low-vision players, automatic navigation assistants for blind and low-vision players, bespoke indicators added to the HUD for deaf and hard-of-hearing players, and many, many more assists. Additionally, every button command can be reassigned to a different input, and even the core difficulty options are broken up into a series of separate pillars that can be individually adjusted (like enemy strength and awareness, ally effectiveness, stealth tolerances, resource abundance, and player damage resistance). You can check a complete list of The Last of Us Part I’s accessibility options on PlayStation.Blog.  I did grow to miss the larger and regularly more vertical levels of Part II; with a few exceptions Part I’s levels are generally more intimate and compartmentalised, no doubt thanks to their origins of being designed to run on hardware that first debuted when Beyoncé was still 33% of Destiny’s Child and Netflix was still only renting DVDs via the post. I also missed the improved melee combat of Part II; Part I doesn’t feature the useful dodge move implemented in the sequel, nor the ability to go prone and crawl. The latter doesn’t feel like a huge loss considering the levels weren’t designed to ever require it in the first place, but the lack of a dodge feels odd considering bringing Part I’s gameplay more in line with Part II’s was a stated aim. Naughty Dog has succeeded in a lot of other areas, though – especially with movement, which is a lot smoother than it was in the original and the 2014 remaster. Animations that seamlessly blend character movements from one direction to another make them appear less skatey and more connected to the ground. Joel and Ellie feel a little weightier as a result, which makes them feel more like they’re always really interacting with the world. There have also been tweaks to the enemy AI, who skulk around the environments in unpredictable patterns and who are now far more effective at flanking and working in small teams to flush us out – just as they were in Part II. Part I has unfortunately stopped short of copying Part II’s brilliant trick of naming its unfortunate grunts for their buddies to call out in dismay as they stumble across their bodies, though. I thought that was quite a clever way of adding even more gravity to the bloodshed, and it’s a shame it didn’t make the cut. It also reduces, but doesn’t completely eliminate, instances where your AI buddy characters shuffle out into the open during stealth sequences and yet remain unseen, making it crystal clear that this is, in fact, a video game. The Last of Us Part I also features some of the best use of the DualSense’s haptics that I’ve felt to date. All manner of subtle feedback is mapped, from the sharp crunch of racking a shotgun shell to the rhythmic beat of a galloping horse. The triggers for weapons can sometimes feel a fraction too firm by default, but overall feeling what’s happening on screen in your hands adds a lot to the experience. The avalanche of haptics do appear to wreak hell on my controller battery, though – I haven’t finished a session yet with more than a single bar of charge left on it. There is a significant slice of the original The Last of Us and its subsequent remaster that hasn’t made it into this PS5 remake, and that’s the multiplayer mode known as Factions. Naughty Dog is, however, working on a standalone multiplayer game set in The Last of Us universe that studio co-president Neil Druckmann recently claimed is “as big as any of our single-player games that we’ve done, and in some ways bigger.” Further details on this untitled multiplayer spin-off are expected next year. Finishing the story still takes about 20 hours, factoring in Left Behind’s two-and-a-half-hour campaign, and when you do it unlocks a pretty extensive set of outfits, visual modes, and gameplay modifiers. Messing around with costumes isn’t something I particularly value, although if you find adding a bit of individuality to your second playthrough attractive you may feel differently. I guess even I was temporarily distracted at the idea of making Ellie a Gran Turismo fan. I wouldn’t expect to get much mileage out of the visual modes, either. The comic-style filter, which flattens out the detail and throws a black outline on characters and key objects, is perhaps worth a look – but the bulk of them are simply coloured filters I can’t imagine playing through. The Last of Us but green! The Last of Us but red! The Last of Us but... dark red! The gameplay modifiers, though, are easily the most appealing as far as I’m concerned, as they’re good old-fashioned cheats (a concept that is sadly virtually extinct in the modern games industry). Infinite ammo and crafting ingredients, slow motion, one-hit kills – all very neat to experiment with. Blasting infected and bandits to bits with unlimited exploding arrows may seem a bit off-brand in The Last of Us, but it’s bloody fun and more than a little cathartic after being on the run from those bastards for so long. A gorgeous and well-honed remake of one of the biggest boppers in the PlayStation pantheon, The Last of Us Part I is the best way to play – or replay – Naughty Dog’s esteemed survival classic. The striking improvements it makes to its completely rebuilt world are complemented by the subtle refinements of its characters’ performances, and while it isn’t retrofitted with every one of the sequel’s best changes, the upgrades to movement and AI make a welcome difference in an already outstanding game. It’s harder to argue it was an entirely crucial remake, though, considering 2014’s The Last of Us Remastered still stands head and shoulders above nearly all of its story-driven, action-adventure peers to this day. "
118,Destroy All Humans! 2: Reprobed ,6.0,"There was a time, back in the PlayStation 2 and original Xbox era, when a lot of sequels were what kids today would call “just a bunch of DLC stuck together.” That’s basically what we’ve got with Destroy All Humans! 2: Reprobed – a loyal, graphically updated remake of a 2006 sequel that goes to new locations, adds a handful of new weapons and enemy types, revamps the upgrade system, and extends the story. Even so, it plays so similarly to 2020’s Destroy All Humans! Reprobed that it feels like a clone of what I played two years ago – except its comedy act has already worn a bit thin.   Bearing that in mind, I have pretty much the same praise and the same complaints about the quality of this remake. The gameplay has held up fairly well in that it’s pretty satisfying to bounce around with a jetpack blasting people with a Palpatine-like lightning gun and popping their heads to collect the brains inside. Cartoony character models and 4K textures look respectable when making out details like Crypto’s pointy teeth, and the dynamic lighting effects cast by various ray guns are a nice touch. It’s the animations and lip syncing that seem behind the times; stiff movements and strange gesticulations during cutscenes remind us of a world before motion-capture animation became the norm and give everyone an action figure look – you can't unsee the barely articulated fingers. It’s also noticeable that there aren’t that many unique faces among NPCs, and it’s fairly common to come face to face with a doppleganger every minute or two when you’ve possessed a human body (which works very much like the first game’s HoloBob disguise). There are a few other hints that this is an old game that’s been upgraded, as well: for one, there’s not a single cryptocurrency joke in a 2022 comedy game where the main character’s name is literally Crypto. But more egregious than that, when you arrive on the Japan map you’ll hear prolific voice actors like Yuri Lowenthal and Steve Blum playing some Japanese caricatures they would probably wince at today. This, more than Crypto’s newly amped-up horniness, is very likely what inspired the warning you get when you start a new game, which cautions that “the story, words, and images contained within may be shocking to the modern human brain.” Skipping ahead 10 years after the first game to 1969, Crypto’s new enemies are buffoonish Soviet KGB agents who’ve discovered the Furon presence on Earth. Joining him are his old boss Pox (voiced by Invader Zim’s hilariously shouty Richard Horvitz) and hypersexualized KGB defector Natalya Ivanova, who is there largely to inspire a constant barrage of sleazy jokes from Crypto. Naturally, absolutely nothing is taken seriously, but that doesn’t stop Destroy All Humans 2 from spending a lot longer on dialogue than its humor justifies. Listening to an alien imitating Jack Nicholson riff at length on the fashion sense of hippies, call a Soviet “Ivan” for the umpteenth time, or rattle off pickup lines like “If I told you you have a great body would you hold it against me?” wasn’t exactly cutting-edge comedy back in 2006, much less today. Mercifully, you can skip most of it easily once you get tired of it. Blasting through the bright and cheery 1950s world of Destroy All Humans! is a simple but satisfying kind of fun, and there’s a lot to be said for that. Just like the original, this remaster’s comedy is a little hit or miss but its attitude is in full force all the way through thanks to some overpowered alien abilities that let you mow down the puny human resistance like an overlord. – Dan Stapleton, July 27, 2020Read our full Destroy All Humans! Reprobed reviewSaints Row – Destroy All Humans 2’s five modestly sized maps are barebones in terms of interactivity and things to do beyond destroying simple-minded humans. They are based on San Francisco, London, Tokyo, Tunguska, and a secret base circa 1969, but outside of payphones virtually nothing is interactable, and they don’t have the abduction and rampage challenge missions the first game does. Local color comes from scanning the thoughts of pedestrians, which contain some of the best jokes you’ll find – many make reference to ‘50s pop culture and current events, while others are just about going commando. I do give Destroy All Humans 2 credit for letting us destroy nearly any building (though they’ll come back if you reload the map), and they’re largely bright and colorful playgrounds to blast enemies in. That fighting could be a bit more engaging, though. I started out on the second-highest difficulty and found myself feeling nearly invincible out of the gate. I died once in the opening couple of hours as I learned how Crypto’s recharging shields worked, but after remembering that his high mobility meant I could simply fly away when I was in danger I didn’t lose another fight until about a dozen hours later. At around that point the challenge finally kicks up a notch and some of the bosses actually fight back in a meaningful way. Even so, my final death count was just 16 after around 25 hours played, and that counts a couple of boss fights where I died multiple times as I experimented and figured out how they worked. There are some mutators you can enable to make everything harder (or easier, or just to give people big heads), but not until you’ve already beaten a mission for the first time and want to replay it. The main reason it’s usually so easy is that the vast majority of fights in missions are against human enemies, and even in large numbers they simply don’t stand a chance – even before you start upgrading your arsenal to more efficiently eradicate them. The fact that you can quickly and easily grab nearly any enemy with psychokinesis and launch them into low Earth orbit even faster than you could blast them with a ray gun – and without spending ammo – makes nearly every encounter trivial and the consequences of being spotted by the police basically irrelevant. (It is notably hilarious that British police will immediately open fire when you’re noticed; UK police don’t typically carry guns.) Admittedly, that’s in keeping with the theme of being a technologically advanced alien invader, but the power-fantasy appeal of these slaughters wears off a lot quicker after having done all of this in the first game already.  Combat never actually gets all that interesting, but it becomes a little more demanding when you start to encounter beefier enemies who are shielded or vulnerable to a specific weapon, requiring you to switch between them instead of picking a gun you like and pulling the trigger ‘til it goes click. The new weapons don’t do much to change things up – the Dislocator disc amusingly bounces targets around randomly but isn’t terribly efficient at killing them, and the others mostly amount to new area-of-effect attacks. By far my most used was Gastro, a summonable flying sidekick who shoots enemies for you; he’s handy when the going gets tough. What saves the missions from being almost entirely made up of simple firefights (often requiring you to scan brains to find your target first) are the secondary objectives that pop up. Maybe you’re prompted to use a specific weapon to kill some specific enemies, or avoid touching the ground when traveling across the city. A lot of these are mundane, but every so often there was something that changed up the straightforward objectives and made me work a little to get a perfect score on the mission and earn the maximum upgrade points.  Body-snatching isn’t used nearly as often as it is in the first game – in fact, just about the only time you need to do it is to get missions from people who only speak to a specific character or, for example, a generic black ninja. I admit I didn’t really miss the light stealth of the first game’s missions, but I never quite got over the disappointment of not being able to use the weapons or abilities of a character I’d possessed. Also mostly unchanged is the flying saucer gameplay, which is still not great. Aside from blowing things up, most of the other tasks it’s used for are moving large objects from place to place, or as an inconvenient form of fast travel between unlocked landing zones. Also, every time you come to a new area you’re encouraged to unlock upgrades by flying around and hoovering up dozens of humans of various stripes, such as police or ninjas or KGB agents. Given how simple it is to deflect incoming missiles and obliterate targets on the ground, the only challenge is searching the map for the specific kinds of humans you need – once you know where they are, it becomes almost as dull as actual vacuuming. You could likely burn through the main missions fairly quickly, but I did every side mission I could find – which was quite a lot. Many of them revolve around converting people to your alien god-worshiping cult, and those generally have you impersonating humans to get a mission – usually killing other humans – after listening to another excessively long introduction that repeats the name “Arkvoodle” way too many times. These missions are certainly useful for feeding the expanded upgrade system (each weapon now has six upgrades instead of three) but it was a little anticlimactic to find that all of this missionary work amounted to a new weapon unlock and didn’t tie into the main story.  It’s kind of a shame Destroy All Humans 2 doesn’t support online co-op, but split-screen is suitably retro and lets you and a friend double down on destruction. (It can also be done over Steam’s Remote Play Together streaming feature if you’re on PC.) There’s no friendly fire and you can’t pick each other up, which limits opportunities for goofing on each other, but few games aren’t improved by running around with a friend. There’s also a Duel mode where you compete to see who can break the most stuff the fastest, which is fun but very much like what you do when you’re just playing co-op in the campaign, and a PK Tennis game that’s sort of like the regular sport but harder to control. I don’t see that last one one taking off, to be honest.  Bugs weren’t too bad, but it’s definitely not the smoothest ride I’ve ever had even among open-world games. I saw things like being unable to get out of the flying saucer until I restarted the mission, vehicles suddenly launching themselves into the sky without being touched, character models from gameplay persisting into a cutscene and standing around like a confused extra who’d walked into the shot, and a handful of crashes in my 25 hours played (which I’m only forgiving of because the aggressive autosave system meant they didn’t cost me more than a few moments’ progress). Destroy All Humans! 2: Reprobed does a fine job of updating the 2006 original to look like a modern game, but that game was a fairly unambitious sequel that didn’t do much to evolve its gameplay. And while I’d be fine with a somewhat repetitive story that breaks up its missions with comedy, this is some solid C+ material that only occasionally lands a chuckle – and more often some serious cringes. Split-screen co-op makes it more enjoyable to blast through and combat does eventually get tougher when bulkier enemies join the fray, but by and large it’s more of the same B-movie sci-fi homage without a lot of brain-popping new ideas. "
119,ollerdrome ,9.0,"I wouldn’t expect roller skating and third-person shooting to be a chocolate and peanut butter situation, but Rollerdrome proves it can be just that. By essentially inventing a new single-player sport, OlliOlli World developer Roll7 has found enough ways to make both sides of this unique coin shine without getting overwhelming. Wrap that package in an intriguing world with more going on beyond the sport than you might expect, and I’ve found myself lost in match after match of skate-shooting mayhem. The year is 2030, and you’re entering the Rollerdrome as a new skater, Kara Hassan. This brutally clever dystopian future bloodsport has participants skate and shoot for their lives against waves of “house players” - aka neatly identifiable enemy classes that range from easy melee combatants to mini-mechs with homing missiles. Most of the time you’ll be chasing  high scores and completing optional challenges in each stage, but Kara’s quest to become champion of the Rollerdrome isn’t just set dressing between the action – in fact, that story reveals a compelling picture of the rather dark reality it takes place in.  First-person sections peppered throughout the campaign let you explore locker rooms, office spaces, and a couple other locations before heading into the arena. While they offer the stylish bonus of transitioning directly from first-person to third-person as you enter a match, these sections are also a chance to better understand the part you play in your corporate employer’s machinations. Rollerdrome doesn’t force you to sift through documents or overhear conversations - you can run straight through the door and get into battle - but I’m glad I chose to, because I found an unexpectedly sharp commentary on some pretty relevant topics like the surprising control over all aspects of life a few companies can wield. However, if you are here just for the action, Rollerdrome absolutely delivers. Roll7 has a knack for crafting finely tuned mechanics tied to extreme sports (look to OlliOlli World as further proof from this year alone). Because the skating and the gunplay are happening simultaneously, the developers found clever and, frankly, necessary places to trim back on complexity in to order make sure those two halves mesh well. While skating, you don’t have to worry too much about your speed unless you stop yourself, or an enemy does. Conversely, aiming your weapons is relatively forgiving, too: as long as you’re within range and your crosshairs are pretty close to your mark, an auto-lock will appear. That doesn’t mean you can’t be precise with your shots, and even hit enemies from further away without the auto lock-on, but some smart concessions ensure both skating and shooting are fun and approachable while still leaving room to be mastered over time. Rollerdrome isn’t aiming to be the most complex skate simulator or shooter around, but there’s still plenty of challenge. I consistently delighted in how it rolled out wave after wave of increasingly difficult enemies while I also tried to complete a list of Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater-like optional tasks. That could be collecting a set of hidden tokens, landing a specific trick, or killing a giant enemy with your measly pistols… ok, maybe that last one isn’t quite like Tony Hawk. Gunning down foes is the bulk of what you’ll be doing, with each run serving as a chance to chain together cool kills and sick skating tricks as you learn how to improve your flow through a given stage with every try. Enemy placement isn’t randomized, so you’ll quickly find more efficient paths to maintain momentum and better ways to knock out some of those fun goals on subsequent attempts. The arenas themselves are also gorgeous thanks to Rollerdrome’s bright and colorful art design. There are a handful of different types of environments a level can be themed around, all of which take place in somewhat pedestrian locations like an arid American desert canyon or a mall in the midwest. But that mundanity is by design if you come to understand Rollerdrome’s fascinating world, and their everyday nature doesn’t detract from the pops of color, hard angular linework, and intriguing retro-near-futuristic design. Those locales are also complemented by composer Electric Dragon’s rocking soundtrack, which never lets up as it takes ‘70s-era disco pacing, blends it with ‘80s synth sounds, and tilts it just enough to sound futuristic. I played Rollerdrome entirely on PS5, and found its use of the DualSense to be pretty admirable. The controller’s haptics have a lot of competing elements to offer feedback on, but there’s a nice balance between the intensity of gunplay and the sensation of grinding a rail vs. skating on the ground to add a nice bit of immersion. The sound of your skating coming through the speaker is a nice bonus, too. It is one of the few games I’ve played recently where my hands were actually tired after playing for extended periods, so perhaps there’s a bit too much feedback at times, especially with the adaptive triggers thrown in to simulate each type of weapon, but on the whole there’s a strong use of the DualSense’s unique features on display. Rollerdrome’s focus on the momentum of the action pulls from the visuals and soundtrack around you and builds that tempo into its mechanics. Each kill notches up your score multiplier, and even just shooting an enemy will let you keep that multiplier from dying out if you’re not able to land finish them off. That most often happened to me because my clip wasn’t full, but Rollerdrome’s creative take on ammo refills meant more bullets were always within reach. Every trick you pull off refills your weapons, and all four of your guns share a collective amount of ammo (which did throw me off the first few times I switched between them). That means you can be grinding past an enemy, recharging your clip on the go so you don’t give them a chance to throw up a defensive shield or attack between shots. I was switching between pistols and shotguns based on enemy type, chaining shots together in between tricks, and falling into a rhythm that was almost zenlike in its flow. Even in failure you can learn how a different weapon choice or another path might have played out better. Learning the level while constantly moving, shooting, and reloading is at the heart of mastering Rollerdrome, but there’s also plenty of room for improvisation as well. The campaign slowly but smartly doles out new enemy types with unique abilities, as well as new weapons, so that I never felt too overwhelmed as I progressed. It’s one thing to take on a guard with a riot shield that is weakest to a shotgun blast, but doing so while two bat-wielding enemies rush you and three missiles are closing in requires quick thinking, so it’s nice that Rollerdrome eases you into the deep end rather than throwing you in headfirst. To help you catch your breath, and look cool while doing it, you can also temporarily slow down time when you press in the left trigger to aim. Slo-mo may be well-worn territory by now, but boy does Rollerdrome’s odd combination of genres make it feel fresh again, turning nearly every slowed-down attack into a screenshot-worthy moment. Even when you’re being pelted with sniper beams, homing missiles, land mines, and more, Rollerdrome offers a chance to dodge and enable a Super Reflex mode, which slows down time even further while boosting the power of your shots. It’s a consistently satisfying reward, but never feels too overpowering thanks to the limited (but fair) amount of ammo you have before needing to pull off some more tricks. You’ll certainly need to make good use of this ability by the end too – nearly all of Rollerdrome’s wide variety of enemies try to stop you in its last couple of stages, and I barely made it out of those bouts on my first couple of tries. There’s almost too much going on at first glance, but a replay or two later and I felt much more comfortable with those deceptively tough final fights. The biggest diversions from its regular campaign levels are a pair of boss battles that are both a highlight and a disappointment. They put a clever twist on the usual mechanics, forcing you to contend with a single, massive enemy rather than waves of smaller ones, and tearing that first behemoth apart is a blast. But the subsequent boss fight doesn’t change that formula up much, so it didn’t feel like a substantially different challenge. Seeing the ingenuity on hand originally, I had hoped for a few more fresh spins in the second boss fight, or even other cool takes on larger enemies before the end.  But that’s more of a momentary blip in Rollerdrome’s otherwise thrilling experience. And if you’re having as much fun with it by the end of the roughly 5-hour campaign as I was (with another few hours already spent replaying levels), there’s a brutal and surprising new option that opens up afterward. The “Out for Blood” campaign offers remixed versions of previous levels with every enemy type available from the first battle (and a remix of the great soundtrack alongside them). I tried the first few and these are no joke, especially if you consider any of the base levels tough, but they should make for an even more rewarding proving ground if you can survive. Inventing a new sport is no easy task, but Rollerdrome finds consistently clever ways to marry extreme skating with explosive gunplay. The story can be ignored in favor of raw action if you want, but it’s intriguing enough that I was excited to find so much hidden underneath this beautiful surface when I went looking. Either way, developer Roll7 has found an inventive mishmash of genres that work so well together I can’t stop replaying levels to better my scores. Its rollerskating and third-person shooting may sound odd together, but just like its stellar soundtrack, Rollerdrome finds harmony in marrying the two to create something that truly shreds. "
120,Saints Row ,6.0,"The superpowers have been scrapped and the sex toys have been safely stowed back in the sock drawer – the new Saints Row has shed its shark-jumping silliness and smutty tendencies in favour of a return to its open-world gangland roots. However, this back-to-basics approach has borne out a fairly primitive kind of crime spree, and stripping the series of its more outlandish elements has laid this reboot’s design and technical inadequacies bare – with no pixelated modesty censor big enough to hide its junk. While there’s a decent amount of fun to be had chasing collectibles and causing chaos, outdated mechanics and repetitive mission design meant that by the end of my time with the new Saints Row I was desperate for something that could genuinely surprise me like a slap to the face from a 40-inch dildo. That’s not to say I wasn’t entertained for significant stretches at a time, and while the rags-to-riches story of the new Saints gang in the sandswept city of Santo Ileso is anything but original it at least facilitates a handful of B-grade action scenes that do an admirable impersonation of Uncharted, with a car-hopping convoy chase and an explosive train robbery among the more dazzling high points along the way to the campaign’s somewhat underwhelming end. But in between these peaks is a relentless rinse-and-repeat cycle of wave-based shootouts against a handful of rival gangs that are uniformly bullet spongy and largely indistinguishable from one another. The only ones that really stand out are the garish, neon-soaked Idols who appear to have grown restless waiting for Ubisoft to announce a new Watch Dogs.  The combat itself is snappy and serviceable, and in the absence of a proper cover system is heavy on circle-strafing and pulling off occasional execution moves in order to replenish your health mid-fight. It doesn’t exactly create a propulsive ballet of ballistics to rival Doom Eternal, but it’s a neatly streamlined setup that allows you to recover from damage without having to scramble for dropped medkits or fumble with a consumables menu. In addition, there’s a recharging skills system that allows you to bind special abilities to four hotkeys. By the time I had fully leveled up my character I had access to everything from flaming punches to the ability to shoot through walls, but rarely did I feel the need to use them in favour of the more traditional skills like throwing grenades and activating temporary armour which made for a mostly conventional brand of firefights. It’s also fairly conventional in its approach to driving. Though there are a handful of aircraft and boats to discover, most of my time in Santo Ileso was spent behind the wheel of a healthy fleet of land vehicles, from motorbikes to monster trucks and everything in between. The floaty and largely homogenized handling meant that I never really grew to favour any one vehicle over the other (aside from the glorious hoverbike unlocked late in the story), but the ability to drift and sideswipe other cars at the tap of a button does give chase sequences a welcome burst of Burnout-style gratification. The fact that you can scramble onto the roof at speed and launch into a wingsuit glide (a move straight out of Just Cause) also makes for some spectacular getaways, although it seems like an oversight that you can’t do the same thing from a motorbike’s saddle. Joining your created boss character, who is a self-described “walking murder party”, are three other foundational members of the new Saints who accompany you as AI partners on certain missions and provide some consistently cringe-inducing banter in the cutscenes in between. They can also be summoned via your phone’s contacts to fight alongside you in the streets, which comes in handy later on when you’re trying to clear out rival gangs from your turf and you want to get the repetitive fights over with in a slightly speedier fashion. None of these partners in crime have particularly interesting personalities, but the one I warmed to the most by far was the brainy pacifist, Eli, mainly because his side story missions involved donning some cardboard armour and swapping my assault rifle for a Nerf gun in a series of live-action role-playing battles. The actual combat experience in these sections remained fundamentally the same as every other shooting gallery sequence, but it was funny to hear the characters make the gunshot sounds with their mouths and perform pretend executions, or to come upon enemies who would stubbornly refuse to acknowledge that you shot them instead of lying down and playing dead. It reminded me of the sticks-and-stones-style warfare of South Park: The Stick of Truth, and provided an enjoyable shift in tone from the more murderous mayhem found elsewhere.  I’d have preferred to have Eli with me on more missions, but you can’t change who you’re stuck with. However, you can certainly change yourself, and Saints Row’s impressive character customisation tool can be accessed at any time via the in-game phone, allowing you to completely alter your appearance either by crafting it yourself or importing one of the growing number of community creations. I’m a fairly simple man with simple tastes, and so I basically bought the mariachi outfit, equipped the Three Amigos pelvic thrust salute emote, and kept them for the 30 hours I spent playing. But you really can let your imagination run wild if you want to get creative, especially in tandem with the numerous clothing options to unlock, whether you want high-end fashion or perhaps merely a taco hat and tissue boxes on your feet. This robust cosmetic customisation extends to your weapons arsenal and garage, and even the Saints’ HQ, which is an abandoned church that evolves and expands over course of the journey and can be augmented with dozens of decorations found hidden across Santo Ileso, from abstract art to hulking pieces of Americana like giant football helmets and cowboy boots. It’s a nice way to organically display Saints Row’s collectibles, and finally answers the question of what would Animal Crossing be like if its residents were 100 percent more homicidal? As you progress through Saints Row’s story and strengthen your gang's stranglehold on the streets of Santo Ileso, an increasing number of criminal ventures become available to purchase. Buying one of these businesses and completing its associated set of missions boosts the Saints’ hourly revenue, giving you access to a slowly swelling pool of cash to spend on more weapons and clothing. You don’t need to acquire all of the dozen ventures in order to complete Saints Row’s campaign, but buying up roughly half of them is mandatory in order to unlock its final story missions. Which is a shame, because precious few of them are actually any good. With its recycled map and wildly overpowered abilities, playing Saints Row IV feels like a lot like enabling god-like cheat codes in Saints Row The Third and going nuts. Its ridiculous story, goofy characters, self-aware humor, and amazing character editor make it all work, especially for those of us who’ve played the previous games and can appreciate its in-jokes. But its appeal is shortened by the ludicrous speed at which we can zip across it and grow tired of its lack of challenge. – Dan Stapleton, August 14, 2013Read the full Saints Row IV reviewCobra Kai-inspired karate dojo would be worth the grind required to raise the $1.6 million asking price, but my reward for doing so was a mere handful of wonky beat ‘em up sections that handled like the yuckiest form of Yakuza’s street fights. Then when I finally unlocked the late-game heist missions, I was crushed to find out that you don’t get to perform the actual robberies. Instead, you complete the setup phase by taking surveillance photos of security cameras and entrances at the target facility, only to be forced to wait in the car while the rest of your gang straps on the ex-Presidents masks and goes inside to commit the crime. It’s like Point Break minus the whole entire point, and although I was the designated getaway driver it honestly felt like I was the one being robbed. It’s just hugely disappointing to find that in almost every instance these venture-based missions are just the same objectives copied and pasted over and over again. Want to run a food truck business? Steal a bunch of food trucks. Want to run an automotive chop shop? Steal a bunch of cars. Want to run a clothing empire? Steal a bunch of delivery trucks. And if you want to increase the amount of money you earn from each business? Then complete the same repeated handful of mindless enemy-clearing protection racket jobs in each district. There’s no real challenge to any of this other than an enormous test of your endurance. Who knew that being the boss of a criminal empire would involve this amount of busywork? Repetitive sandbox mission structure is just one of the many ways the new Saints Row feels burdened by design decisions that should have died along with the power supply on your PlayStation 2. There are aggravating instant-fail stealth sections, nagging prompts for you to return to a mission should you move even slightly away from the vicinity of your enemies, and absolutely no nuance to the notoriety system. Should you find yourself with an escalating wanted level, you don’t need to indulge in an exciting game of cat and mouse in order to break the line of sight – you can just drive in a straight line for a few blocks and the Santo Ileso police will just give up, making them seem less like super cops and more like Super Troopers. There’s also a noticeable lack of interactivity from what we’ve come to expect from modern open worlds, particularly post-Grand Theft Auto V. You can’t play the arcade game cabinets or withdraw cash from the ATMs, bicycles can be knocked out of bike stands but never ridden, and a sizable chunk of Santo Ileso is taken up by a strip of gigantic casinos that you’re forbidden from entering, let alone gambling in. It's possible that some of this functionality will be added in the form of DLC, but for now pretty much your only interactions with the world around you is to shoot at it, jump off it, or smash it to bits. Santo Ileso provided a pretty canvas for my carnage, but it didn’t feel like a world I could truly immerse myself in. Blade Runner 2049. Sadly, the sandy surrounds of Santo Ileso aren’t the only rough edges to be found in the new Saints Row. There were regular bugs that I encountered in the PC version (and my IGN colleagues saw similar issues on consoles), whether it was taking damage every time I got out of a car, or accidentally smashing the window and firing my gun every time I got in. Certain button prompts, such as activating a GPS route or picking up a hidden drug package, were regularly unresponsive, while at other times I’d ride motorbikes with my character just floating alongside the bike in a standing position. Occasionally missions would just break – like during a heist mission where my gang just never emerged from the bank and I had to force a restart because I couldn’t trigger the getaway – and the tense final showdown against Saints Row’s main villain turned into a farce when he snapped into a T-pose and started stretching and flailing around like one of those wacky used car yard tube men. Ironically, this was as close to the ridiculousness of the series of old that this new Saints Row ever got – it’s just a shame it was entirely by accident. The AI isn’t the only thing prone to misbehaving, and indeed Saints Row’s two-player co-op allows you to play silly pranks on your partner by completing certain challenges – like racking up a set number of melee kills or vehicle drifts. The effect of a prank is random, yet while temporarily transforming your partner into a toilet or a vending machine may cause a few modest laughs at first, the novelty quickly wears off and I basically ignored the pranking system from very early on. Otherwise my experience with co-op has been rife with connection problems with my partner regularly dropping out mid-mission and resulting in failure, and even when it works having a second player in tow does little to elevate Saints Row’s more menial tasks. Still, at least I had someone to wait in the car with me during the heists. For a game that gives us so much freedom to be exactly who we want to be via its superb customisation options, it’s odd that Saints Row itself struggles to forge its own identity when it comes to the types of wanton criminal activities it makes available to us. There’s definitely no shortage of shallow shoot ‘em up thrills to be had here, but it’s a very familiar and uninspired brand of sandbox fun that’s unlikely to wow anybody who’s played a Saints Row game before, much less a GTA. There are a few spectacular story moments and the city of Santo Ileso serves as a sprawling new playground full of surprisingly antiquated and non-interactive amusements, but the distinct lack of new gameplay ideas – and the frequency with which some of its least interesting ones are reused – means this Saints Row feels more like a repetitive retread than a proper reboot. It’s definitely a new gang of Saints, but they’re guilty of the same old sins. "
121,Soul Hackers 2 ,7.0,"After laying pretty much dormant for 25 years, Soul Hackers is an unexpected series for Atlus to try and bring into the modern age. While it doesn’t take any risks or bring anything new to the JRPG table, Soul Hackers 2 is enjoyable enough to justify that long-awaited revival. It may be held back a bit by its uninspired level design and turn-based battle mechanics, but the story still shines bright enough to help carry it thanks to a diverse cast of characters and engaging themes about what it means to be human. Soul Hackers 2 may technically be a sequel, but it smartly serves more as a soft reboot, benefitting players who are hopping into the franchise for the first time. Created as an agent of a near-all-knowing artificial intelligence, you play as Ringo, a charismatically curious human construct who is sent on a mission with their partner Figue to change the future and save the world from being destroyed. Ringo brings an intriguing perspective while saving the world, trying to learn more about both it and the human race while doing so. Throughout the story they learn more and more about humans, why they’re important to save, and why their flaws matter, and it was fascinating to watch them go along that journey.  Even with the knowledge that Soul Hackers 2 and its predecessor are hardly connected, it is worth mentioning the change in tone between them. The original presented itself as dark and grimy while the sequel is bright and flamboyant, exploring bustling locations in Japan to shop, upgrade weapons, or complete requests. It feels like Atlus wants to shift this franchise into a new light, and while this updated style does bring more flashy flair, it doesn’t seem to have much other benefit to it. The minute-to-minute gameplay is eerily similar to Atlus’s other modern JRPGs, which leaves Soul Hackers 2 without the ability to stand out from the pack. The overall plot serves as a rather generic “end of the world'' scenario, a popular trope for both JRPGs and Atlus games alike, but having those stakes laid out in the opening cinematic halts much of the urgency or evolution to it. The main focus, however, are the party members who are dealing with the struggles in their personal lives. Unlike most other Atlus JRPGs, the party members that joined up as companions during my near-60-hour adventure were introduced pleasantly early on, allowing me to familiarize myself with them for a longer time. Milady, the passive but passionate assassin of the group stood out to me due to her interesting relationship with a few key characters, but I believe that the fan favorite will end up being the selfish-but=loveable detective Saizo, who is fighting to reconcile his relationship with his ex-partner. Each of them quickly caught my interest with their polarized perspectives on both the world and the ongoing threat at large – personified by a villian poignantly named Iron Mask. Iron Mask’s goal is to collect five spectral beings called covenants, which will allow him to summon an entity known as “The Great One” and destroy the world. That may sound one-note, but some genuine surprises and relationships Iron Mask has give him more depth than you'd expect (even if the plot takes some hits for it in ways I won't spoil). The story likes to present itself as something more intimate between its small group of intriguing characters, but that focus can feel out of place considering how big the stakes are from the get-go. And despite the lengthy play time, a few major character moments don’t feel entirely earned because certain subplots aren’t given the time to fully flesh them out. Soul Hackers 2 is more or less split into two parts. There are Japan’s dungeons, which progress the main plot as you complete them, and the Axis, which lets you delve into a “Soul Matrix” – an optional datascape dungeon for each character in your party. While it is not an absolute necessity to complete each Soul Matrix, you do pick up some useful new skills, and I found that they contained the biggest and most important chunk of each character's backstory. If I weren’t completing each new floor as they unlocked, there would have been several character moments later on in the main story that wouldn’t have resonated on the same level. Each Matrix gets a new floor when you reach a specific part of the campaign, but there are several gates that can only be opened once you hit a required soul level with that character. These soul levels can be increased when selecting certain dialogue choices that are supported by that party member or by having a drink with them at the local bar. Getting to spend extra moments with each character and learn more about them through these interactions is where I found myself experiencing a deeper and more profound connection with my party members. Your party consists of Devil Summoners, people who forge contracts with demons to gain their abilities. When exploring dungeons, the demons that made up my team would place themselves at different locations as I scoured my way through. Whenever I spoke with them I was given a bunch of rewards, including upgrade materials, items, healing, and even the ability to recruit a new demon. I always felt rewarded by finding these conversations, and each demon has a unique personality that brought additional charm whenever a new one joined my team. The dungeons themselves, however, left much to be desired. Every single level was underwhelming to explore, which is a real shame knowing full well what Atlus is capable of from other JRPGs. Levels either contained no puzzles at all or, when puzzles were present, they felt like more of a distraction to slow me down rather than an engaging, gratifying challenge that I wanted to overcome. Variety between the designs is also stagnant; there are several dungeons that take place in similar-looking underground railway locations, as well as the Soul Matrix that is visually identical as you descend to a new floor. Combat in Soul Hackers 2 is very familiar if you’ve played a Persona game or Tokyo Mirage Sessions, but doesn’t meet the depth of what came before it. Atlus loves to try out new battle mechanics that you must master in order to maximize your combat effectiveness in every game, and Soul Hackers 2’s flavor of this is building a demon stack. Initially, a stack is made whenever you hit an enemy with their weakness, and at the end of every turn you perform a sabbath – an all-out attack where all the demons in the stack assault the enemies. It’s a fun mechanic that gets the job done, but doesn’t stay consistently engaging due to lack of growth over the campaign. As my party members gained summoner skills by progressing through their respective Soul Matrix, they learned other ways to build a stack, but even with those new additions I never saw a significant increase to my stack count. One of the few things that is unique to Soul Hackers 2 is sabbath skills. These abilities can be used to add another effect to the team assault, like dealing more damage or healing your party. By going to the local circus I could fuse my demons into stronger ones, while going to the local weapon smith would let me gain commander skills, like being able to change demons on the fly or adding more to a stack. However, similarly to the stack mechanic, these features were introduced so early on that it started to get stale by the time I got to later sections. Soul Hackers 2 is, at its heart, a streamlined Atlus JRPG, serving as a great entry point for anyone new to the genre or the developer in general. The combat and dungeon delving are entertaining, if fairly familiar, and the charming cast of characters kept me interested all the way through its roughly 60-hour campaign. But a disappointing lack of creativity in its battle systems and a fairly shallow overarching story mean this newly resurrected series will need to do more if it wants to set itself apart amongst Atlus’ best. "
122,umbleverse ,9.0,"Much of the joy from any good battle royale is derived from the feeling of making big plays, and hoo boy! If there’s one thing that Rumbleverse is good at, it’s setting you up for opportunities for big plays. The latest from Iron Galaxy Studios (the developers of Divekick and seasons 2 and 3 of Killer Instinct) Rumbleverse is a free-to-play, melee-driven battle royale with a very Fortnite’y, but nonetheless charming cartoony artstyle, infused with all of the pomp and grandeur of professional wrestling. One moment you’ll be Irish-Whipping an opponent into a wall for a brutal wall combo, the next you’ll be chokeslamming bodies off of skyscrapers, and occasionally giant-swinging them into the ocean. It’s silly fun at its best, and while there are several painful moments in the form of slow matchmaking, a variety of latency-related bugs, and a shop that feels a bit understocked and pricey compared to what the competition offers (at least right out of the gate) Rumbleverse is nonetheless one of the most unique battle royales in recent memory and a breath of fresh air in a crowded genre. The basics of Rumbleverse will be familiar: 40 players drop into a humongous map, scrounge around to find loot, and then battle it out, until there’s only one person remaining. But Rumbleverse isn’t content to copy and paste its gameplay, and so it tweaks just about every element of that well-established formula in interesting ways.  For one, there’s no traditional gear or inventory – no guns, no armor, no grenades, and no hyper-specific attachments or augments to manage. Instead, you fight with your fists, feet, and whatever street signs you can rip from out of the ground. (There’s still some loot to gather: rather than searching out gear, you collect stat-increasing protein powders that buff your health, stamina, or damage; and also gather skill manuals that teach you a variety of special moves.) The thing I love about this is that Rumbleverse completely avoids that feeling of helplessness that almost every battle royale has at the start of a match when you’re stuck without a weapon. It makes early engagements so much more fun when you drop into a hot starting area – you don’t have to just immediately run off and try to find the nearest weapon to defend yourself. Some of the most fun I’ve had is dropping on the giant trophy statue and trying to knock everyone off right at the start in order to claim all the high-value loot lying on top. It feels like a mini victory on its own. The hand-to-hand combat moves are largely straight-up adapted from between the ropes of a WWE match – your mist spits, chokeslams, and superkicks, just to name a few – but then there are a handful that draw inspiration from the world of video games. There’s the classic Izuna Drop from Ninja Gaiden, a WWF No Mercy-inspired low blow that can be used as reversal from off the ground, and an aerial flipping kick called the “Wreck’t Shot” which, well, if you don’t know where that’s from you need to brush up on your PS2-era JRPGs.  It certainly tracks that Rumbleverse’s developer is partially responsible for one of the best fighting games of the last decade in Killer Instinct, because it’s very easy to see the fighting game sensibilities at the heart of Rumbleverse’s combat. The fighting revolves around largely the same kind of rock, paper, scissors system that most fighting games adhere to: Guarding beats strikes, grappling beats guarding, and strikes beat grapples. There is, of course, added nuance thanks to the addition of special attacks, weapon attacks, power attacks, and super moves, but by and large, Rumbleverse’s combat system is very easy to understand even at just a glance. But there’s so much more to it than just that, and mind games are at play in just about every interaction. Do you rush in with a risky dropkick and hope that they do practically anything other than just block? Do you rush in and then roll to try and bait out an attack? Just like any good fighting game, Rumbleverse always keeps my brain firing at full speed in every single encounter, and the feeling of outplaying your opponent by reading and appropriately responding to their actions is just the best.  Even outside of the mental aspect of the combat, the actual mechanics are top notch as well.  You can spend stamina to dodge-cancel out of certain special move animations and pull off some super-slick combos, or tricking your opponent into thinking it’s their turn to attack; you can use charged attacks to stun enemies long enough to Irish Whip them into a wall, allowing you to continue into a wall combo, you can use a faster super move activation to combo into your super move; and the list just goes on and on. I felt like every time I played, I learned some sort of new technique that I had never known before. There’s just an incredible amount of thought that’s gone into every aspect of combat design. Granted, Rumbleverse could do a better job of actually teaching this to us. The only tutorials are locked away in the Playground mode, which is part training mode, part tutorial, and needs to be queued into like a regular match. The info within it is great, but I can’t help but wish it was offline and that the tutorials within it could also be found elsewhere. There’s currently only one map, but it is appropriately enormous and has a great variety of places to do battle in, each favoring a particular type of fight. Fighting along the coast makes you especially wary of throws, as a single giant swing or Irish Whip can send you flying off to an instant watery grave; fighting in the suburban neighborhood gives you opportunities to hide in the bushes to either recover or lie in for an ambush; and fighting in downtown Grapital City will make you always have an eye towards the sky out of fear of explosive flying elbow drops. Rumbleverse has a couple of other twists on the typical battle royale formula tucked away in its tights. For one, it incentivizes everyone to get into scraps and put themselves at risk by rewarding them with random perks once they hit certain milestones of damage inflicted. These perks may not seem like much early on, and truthfully, I didn’t even notice them at all in my first couple of games, but they truly are difference makers if you have the means and the knowledge to put them to use. One will restore your health if you stand still for a period of time; another adds an explosive effect to your standard three-hit combo, making it capable of wall bouncing; and another still will add a follow-up dive-bomb attack to your dropkick, making it deal a bunch more damage. They strike a nice balance by being just powerful enough to give anybody using them an edge, without feeling like those without them simply don’t have a chance. They’re also just a nice randomized element that makes every round of Rumbleverse feel different. Another big difference is that the ring that slowly closes in at timed intervals, shrinking the available play space, doesn’t actually deal any damage. Instead, in true pro wrestling fashion, staying outside the ring will initiate a countdown from 10, and if you’re caught outside when the count reaches zero you’re disqualified. I love this change, especially once things get down to the final few players and the playfield is so tiny that you can’t help but run out of the ring from time to time. It also creates some extremely tense moments where you just make it back in before the 10 count, or try to stop someone else from making it back in before they get DQ’d. Unfortunately, while Rumbleverse impresses on a mechanical level, on a technical level it’s been struggling in its first couple of days since its launch. Apart from tedious queue times at start up, occasional server disconnections, and difficulties logging in, it also takes an extraordinarily long time to drop into a match, and more than a few of the matches I’ve played have been affected by latency to the point where it’s just not fun to play. That said, there have already been steps made towards improvement as I continued playing over the launch weekend. The servers went from being nearly unplayable the first Saturday after launch to largely without issue by the very next day. The queue and matchmaking times are still longer than I’d hoped, but it’s at least a great sign for Rumbleverse’s continued health that the fixes that the developers are implementing are making noticeable differences. As far as the free-to-play aspect goes, Rumbleverse is pretty standard. There’s a shop with a rotating supply of clothes, emotes, and so on, but fans will also send you a variety of customizable items when you reach new levels of fame, just by playing and earning fame points. Building my closet of tops, tights, masks, and profile backgrounds has definitely been on the slow side, with you only getting two or three items every level up, with those items very often just being something super insignificant, like a new stat sticker to put on your profile, or a new border. The shop is pretty barren right now, and the prices seem a bit on the high side for what you get. As an example, a simple emote that just shoots off some pyro costs $10. For my 10 bucks, I’d personally hope for something with a little more animation, or music, or some sort of flair at the very least. There’s a lot of potential in what they can do with the pro wrestling theme in terms of these emotes and costumes, so hopefully future updates to the shop come with some more appealing items. And as of this writing a battle pass is on the way, along with the start of season one on August 18, so we’ll no doubt get a better idea of what to expect from the inaugural season of content updates in due time.  If it can get its technical issues under control quickly (and progress is already being made on that front), Rumbleverse’s fantastic wrestling-flavored gameplay has everything going for it to become the next big thing in the battle royale genre. Once I was in a match slammin’ bodies, slappin’ chests, and RKO’ing dudes from out of nowhere, it quickly became some of the most fun I’ve had playing video games in 2022. And it’s more than just spectacle – there are some extremely deep and well-thought-out mechanics ingrained in its combat design, opening up plenty of possibilities to outplay and out-think your opponent just like in a smartly designed fighting game. I’m hoping it fleshes out the shop with more worthwhile and over-the-top items, but if Rumbleverse is this good right out of the gate, I can’t wait to see where it goes over the next few years. "
123,Cult of the Lamb ,8.0,"When I started Cult of the Lamb, I wasn’t expecting to be shoveling so much poop. This is a true wolf of a base-management game in the sheepish clothing of an action-roguelite, but it balances that unexpected mix of genres with grace. Its adorable art style and surprising amount of side activities fill its relatively linear structure up with personality – and while its combat sections aren’t deep enough to keep me coming back after the credits rolled, this is a dark ritual I’m very glad to have completed. Cult of the Lamb puts you in the fluffy hooves of a cult leader newly resurrected by an imprisoned deity called The One Who Waits. Now it’s up to you to free your master by recruiting new followers to the flock, building a base for them to live in, and going on bloody crusades against the otherworldly entities that trapped him. That loop of gathering supplies, tending to your worshipers, upgrading both your character and your homestead, and then going out to do it again is extremely satisfying, with a charming art style and expressive animations that bring a bit of joy to every ruthless corner of it.  While Cult of the Lamb is a roguelite dungeon crawler that randomizes level layouts and the items you come across each run as you become progressively more powerful between them, comparing it directly to similar games like Hades or Rogue Legacy would be a bit misleading. Each crusade is randomized and repeatable in the same way, but they are also far shorter – most take around just 10 minutes total. You even pick between one of four disconnected areas to fight through at the start of every run, with a boss waiting to be beaten at the end of each one in order to complete the story, which means Cult of the Lamb lacks that familiar roguelike tension of seeing how deep into the gauntlet you can manage to make it every time. Those short outings aren’t necessarily a bad thing, but they did mean I spent most of the 13 hours it took me to reach the credits building out my base and completing little quests for NPCs rather than swinging a weapon. It’s safe to say that for all the DNA Cult of the Lamb shares with a game like Dead Cells, it’s just as closely related to a management game like Oxygen Not Included. That’s good company to be in regardless, and I enjoyed that my decisions out on the hunt were often influenced by the needs of my cultists diligently working back home rather than it always being the other way around. That’s not to say the combat isn’t fun in its own right, though. It’s not overly complex, with little more than a single attack button, a special “curse” power, and a dodge-roll at your disposal, but each of those elements are honed to an effective edge. The dodge in particular is delightfully snappy, giving you a responsive way to evade the well-telegraphed attacks of enemies as you cut through rooms full of cultists and monsters alike. The different types of weapons, curses, and tarot card-based buffs you can find along the way can also help shake up each new outing as you work your way toward the end of the campaign. The one major drawback is that you are given a random weapon and curse at the start of each crusade, but unfortunately you have no control over which ones you’ll see and the possibilities are far from equal. While the default sword and harder-hitting axe are reliably great, the frustratingly slow hammer and the gloves (which deal most of their damage only on the final hit of their attack combo) are ill-suited against Cult of the Lamb’s fairly mobile enemies. Similarly, some curses can be satisfying AoE blasts while others drop a pile of ineffective goo. With runs being so short, that means you frequently won’t even get a chance to find a workable replacement before the end, and having a go at a boss hamstrung by a poor roll at the very start definitely wore on my patience more than once. But while you don’t get enough opportunities to choose your attacks, you are given plenty of chances to influence your kit mid-run through tarot cards. These power-ups give you boons that can range from extra health to adding a projectile to your melee attack to making enemies drop fish when killed. It’s a bit of a shame that a majority of them are simply stat upgrades like a 20% increase to weapon damage, meaning they never did much to shake up my actual playstyle on a given run, but getting lucky by finding a rare tarot card to fully double the attack speed of my axe was still a lot of fun when it happened. Of course, stumbling upon a powerful card like that could also trivialize the boss encounters on the default difficulty. These fights can be creative both in the visual design of the horrific eldritch monstrosities you face and the almost bullet hell-like attacks they throw at you. But if you have even a passing familiarity with roguelike action games, you’ll probably want to notch the difficulty up to Hard from the start – I rarely had to do much more than spam the attack button to beat each boss on my first try, which doesn’t really give their clever designs the spotlight they deserve. Despite the horrible appearance of Cult of the Lamb’s largest enemies, many of them will delightfully turn into adorable friends your size upon defeat – friends who can then be recruited to your cult back home. The action sections may be how you move the relatively simple plot along, but the base building is where all of the real mechanical progression lies. Converting folk you find out in the field lets you put them to work gathering resources like wood and stone, worshiping your visage to generate a resource called devotion, or cleaning up the poop they’ll generously litter the edges of your camp with. You’ll be doing a lot of that work yourself to start, but it’s immensely satisfying to watch your base grow – both technologically and visually – as you recruit more followers. Your base and your lamb each have tech trees to work up, unlocking either new structures to build or new abilities and weapons to find, respectively. That means things like watering your farms by hand can eventually be handled by your recruits, and more interesting options gradually open up that let you send followers off on expeditions for resources or even temporarily turn them into demons that can assist you in battle. There’s a ton to dig into here, and I enjoyed the balance that was managing the faith, hunger, cleanliness levels of my followers, but it also made me wish keeping track of them on an individual basis was easier. Once your cult membership starts to approach the double digits, it can be extremely hard to tell who is doing what task, who you’ve already “blessed” that day for an experience boost, and who is just sitting around twiddling their thumbs. Thankfully you don’t really need to worry too much about that stuff to keep up with their desires, especially after you’ve unlocked better facilities for them, but Cult of the Lamb made me care enough about optimizing my enterprise that it frustrated me when I couldn’t. One way it does offer a welcome amount of control is in its cosmetic options, which practically outnumber its functional ones. You can easily move buildings around your camp, change the appearance and name of every new follower you recruit, and cover every corner in superfluous decorations that often have to be earned or unlocked as you play. You don’t have to go deep on any of this stuff if you don’t actually want to, but it gave me an ownership over my cult that got me far more invested – I even played favorites with my followers, giving the best of them extra attention and mourning them when they eventually died of old age… or when I sacrificed them, because who needs an old mouth to feed. In that vein, a huge part of what makes Cult of the Lamb so impressive is how it leans into the goofiness of its theme, and the excellent aesthetics that accompany all of its chaos. It absolutely nails the balance of its cutesy cartoon vibes and its demonic set dressing, with dozens of charming animal forms for you to find – be that elephants, giraffes, unicorns, or strange spider… things. The soundtrack is also probably one of the catchiest I’ve heard in a long, long time; a chipper yet spooky mix that I haven’t been able to get out of my head. There’s also just way more to do than I would have expected. There’s a whole world map with individual (if small) locations to visit, each with shops to buy new tarot cards and cosmetics from as well as characters to meet and complete quests for. There’s a fishing minigame, a dice-rolling minigame, a sidequest designed to send you back into locations you’ve already beaten with an increased challenge. There are some secrets to find too, and the quirky character designs are all top notch no matter what corner of the map you visit. That said, Cult of the Lamb does feel like a roguelite I am pretty much done with after 13 hours, about half of which I played on hard mode. I reached the end of both its progression trees about two-thirds of the way through, and I’ve completed nearly all of the side activities I’ve managed to find. You can revisit levels you’ve already beaten in an endless mode that continues to amp up the difficulty nicely if you want to play Cult of the Lamb closer to a more traditional roguelike, but there’s not really enough variety in its weapons, tarot cards, or straightforward map layouts to make me actually want to do much of that. I had a blast reaching the credits, but this ultimately felt more like a linear campaign than its roguelike action sections might suggest. Cult of the Lamb is as adorable as it is unsettling, an eclectic mix of genres and themes that come together extremely well. Its combat is immensely satisfying even if its short runs and the relative lack of variety between them doesn’t give it the lasting appeal of other action roguelikes, and building my very own cult base and tending to a flock of followers was just as fun as any swing of the axe. I may not revisit it now that the credits have rolled, but Cult of the Lamb is something altogether different that I had an absolute blast playing. "
124,GigaBash ,7.0,"Picture a game that looks left at all of the fans clamoring for a new Power Stone game, looks right at the ones who want a new War of the Monsters, and then shrugs its shoulders and says “Why not both?” That game is GigaBash. It’s a 3D arena fighter with a collection of 10 monsters and mechas inspired by classic kaijus and a focus on simple controls, environmental destructibility, and the power fantasy of being a giant monster slamming other giant monsters through skyscrapers. It’s not much more than meets the eye, but its claws are certainly sharp enough to scratch any kaiju-sized party fighter itches. GigaBash’s biggest strength is how it balances its immediately intuitive controls with just the right amount of depth underneath that approachable surface. Every character has a basic attack and special attack, a charged version of those attacks, an aerial version of those attacks, a charged aerial version of those attacks, and then two unique abilities that are performed by holding block and pressing a button. In addition to that, there’s a button to dodge, a dodge attack to hit enemies on the run, a button to pick up and throw enemies, objects, or even buildings, and that’s it. This ease of play allows GigaBash to fit snugly in that spot every friend group should have as a game where you just hand the controller over to someone with little to no knowledge of how to play, tell them a few quick things, and they’ll have a fun time.  But none of that means that there’s no sauce to GigaBash’s combat. There’s not many playable monsters on the roster – a total of 10 in all – but that’s a blow that’s softened thanks to the amount of depth and flavor coming from each of their unique movesets. Gorogong is a close-range-AOE focused menace, with several moves that hit like a truck and allow him to close the distance, blast an enemy against the wall, and follow up for big damage. Contrast that to a character like Pipijuras, who is slow and has trouble getting away once someone gets in, but can cover approaches both from above and straight ahead with powerful projectiles. And then there’s Gigaman, who is fast and agile, and relies on stringing together aerial juggles to get his gameplan going. The developers also smartly included a special meter that increases as you deal damage. Once it’s full, you can activate it to turn into a giant S-Class monster for a limited amount of time, which can only be hurt by other S-Class monsters. It’s a great mechanic because it incentivizes you to actually get into the action, even if it means putting yourself at risk of taking damage yourself. The S-Class transformation is a huge power boost, and often the best defense against it is to make sure you’ve got one ready yourself so you can match blows. In addition to the ability to turn into an S-Class monster, there’s also a special Smash Ball-esque item, which will grant an ultimate attack to whoever lands the last hit upon destruction, leading to some fun scrambles. There’s even a limited training mode called the Gym that lets you practice juggles, learn how to punish enemy attacks, find out which moves will wallbounce an enemy, and so on and so forth. It’s a very welcome addition and helps make the hidden depth of GigaBash much more discoverable. That said, this is still a party game at heart, and that depth only goes so deep. While GigaBash supports online play with casual and competitive matchmaking for those who want to test their skill against others, it’s the type of game that’s much better suited for local multiplayer with good friends, where these types of  unpredictable game changing moments, like a when a defeated enemy calls down a gigantic laser from beyond the grave and melts you, is something that you can laugh at as opposed to get frustrated by. Another big source of these wild moments is courtesy of GigaBash’s stages, which are chock full of gimmicks and hazards that totally change up how players can approach combat. Historically in games like this, gimmicky stages can be good or bad, depending on how central the gimmick is to the level and how much it affects traditional play, but GigaBash finds a nice middle ground for the most part. One level has an active volcano that slowly engulfs 90% of the stage in lava; another preps a missile in the center of the stage that can be ridden off-screen and then aimed for a big explosion on the field; and another still takes place in a jungle rife with spiked walls that you can stick enemies into and tall trees that you can hide in to try and avoid being spotted by your opponents.  On that note, local multiplayer has a special Mayhem mode that cannot be played online, which is a shame because it’s an absolute blast. Instead of facing off against opponents in traditional fights, you compete in a series of minigames with special twists. Like one that feels like a Kaiju version of Windjammers where you’re only able to fight by throwing UFOs that bounce off the walls and can be caught with good timing; or another that has you attempting to blow your rivals up by knocking bombs towards them in an arena that constricts every time a bomb goes off; or one that has you fighting on thin ice and rewards the last player standing with the victory. There’s a wide variety of minigames that each force you to play a little bit differently, and there’s a great sense that anything can happen and anyone can walk away with a win without things totally devolving into the realm of random chaos. On the single player side of things, GigaBash is very light. There’s a serviceable four chapter story mode that takes you through the stories of four of the ten monsters, and while it at least features great art and a decent variety of objectives throughout, it’s ultimately pretty dry with a lack of voice acting, predictable story beats, and uninteresting characters. When you’ve got a group of friends sitting on a couch with controllers in hand, GigaBash is a hell of a good time. The roster of 10 Kaiju-inspired monsters is on the small side, but every character plays so differently and packs so much personality that it ultimately feels like a minor issue. The fun doesn’t translate that well to the solo or even the online experience, but those options are at least present and serviceable, resulting in a game that I don’t see myself playing very often on my own, but one that I’d have on a shortlist of suggestions for when friends come over. "
125,Hard West 2 ,7.0,"Cowboys, outlaws, ghosts, demons, werewolves. These are all good things. Combine them together and you get the Weird Western genre, which must surely be an even better thing, right? Hard West 2 makes a good case for it, standing as a tactical weird western that knows this genre has to look, feel, and sound good first and foremost — even if that means sometimes it doesn't actually play as smoothly as you'd like. Hard West 2 is more of a thematic sequel to 2015's Hard West as opposed to a literal one. It tells a new, unrelated story across its 20-30 hour campaign, with three difficulties of escalating brutality to choose from, and even completionists shouldn't really worry about playing the original before this one. The world design is really what draws you in beyond the superficial surface. You lead a posse of badass cowboys on the verge of the supernatural in the Hard West. After a bad deal with a bad devil goes badly wrong, you are down a few souls and would very much like them back. In fact, the plan is to get them back at the barrel of a gun. (The devil's name is Mammon, by the way, and he has an extremely cool ghost train with giant metal centipede legs.)  The campaign is split between doing dialogue-driven quests in overworld areas and diving into turn-based combat missions for most of the playtime. The writing both in and out of missions is hit or miss. It has more than a few lines with weird grammar or eye-rolling cliches, but does the job well enough that I wasn't skipping cutscenes or text-only descriptions. The centerpiece of Hard West 2 are its tactical battles. They're pretty good, but for everything I like about them I dislike something else. The combat is reliable and has minimal frustrating randomization, but on the harder missions that makes it feel more like a puzzle than tactical exercise. That distinction matters too: On the middle-of-the-road Hard difficulty I had to restart multiple missions, some as many as five times, to figure out the solution to that puzzle and get a win. That's balanced against the flexible character abilities and neat weapons available. Combined, they form a range of powers that synergize with well-designed environments to enable tricks, combos, and chained kills. You get three actions per turn, with shooting usually taking two or three of those, meaning that the rules overall favor defensive fighting. Your attacks do fixed damage based on the weapon used, and all that changes is the chance to hit based on range, elevation, and the enemy's cover. Combined with that defensive focus you have a real problem to overcome when closing in on new groups of enemies: They'll probably get effective shots at you before you get some at them. Luckily, you have four tools to play with. The first is trick shooting, which lets certain weapons bounce bullets off of metal objects to circumvent enemy cover. The second is luck, meaning that missed shots (among other things) fill a pool to spend on bonuses to attacks in later turns. The third are your character abilities, unique powers everyone has: Like Old Man Bill, who's full of bullets and likes to send them back at the enemy in an explosive burst, or Flynn, who can magically swap places with anyone she can see, ally or enemy, at the cost of a little health. The fourth tool is Bravado, the key system that lets you overcome enemy advantage. When your characters get a kill they immediately refill all their action points. They can do that as many times per turn as you can get kills, and setting up someone to get four, five, or six kills in one turn is the best part of Hard West 2. It's also a tension on that puzzle-like difficulty: There's always the feeling that you could better optimize the fixed damage numbers of your weapons against the enemy's health. You do that arithmetic every turn, constantly, for more and more kills, and the higher difficulties demand you balance optimal kill counts against defensive movement to succeed. But beyond that standout mechanic, the combat doesn't do much that's new or exceptional, and even lacks a few things I'd expect — you can't vault most small objects, for example, and a lot of cover is indestructible even to dynamite. That, and those area of effect attacks are two dimensional, which leads to odd situations like not being able to shoot someone with your shotgun because they're on a balcony below you. That said, the good qualities of those combat systems outweigh the frustrations, and a mix of interesting enemies and varied missions do keep it fresh throughout. Every mission is packed with weird western clutter and character that not only looks good but serves as cover for you to interact with and play around. Rickety wooden frontier streets packed with hanging signs and big marble banks at the end, ramshackle homesteads cluttered with disused farm equipment, sprawling occult-plus-steampunk mining operations — I think you get it. The objects and visuals in missions are real pretty, even disproportionately so compared to the design and writing, and the sound design and voice acting have very few flaws. There's also a great soundtrack, courtesy of Dead Space and Tomb Raider composer Jason Graves. It's not just the atmosphere that's got a lot going on, either. The enemies you fight are weird and cool, ranging from run-of-the-mill bandits and lawmen to demonic cultist covens, wendigos, and mindless revenant gunmen. There's even a bit of historical inspiration, with one native antagonist group being a mustache-twirling, evil twin mirror version of the real-life Ghost Dance Movement. (Hard West 2 does not, thankfully, fall into the atrocious trap of painting the many native peoples of the west with one brush, even if many of its depictions are more fantasy than reality.) Gin Carter, the roguish gambler and leader who now lacks a soul, is a pretty generic RPG leader for you to inhabit, but your other party members are exercises in memorable character design. You've got Kevin Conroy as Old Man Bill, who died a long time ago and is really grumpy about coming back; Lazarus, a fire-and-brimstone-and-bullets preacher; Cla'lish, voiced by Mela Lee, a no-nonsense pacific northwestern native tracker and sharpshooter who can also commune with and summon the dead. But there are two real standouts: First, Brandi Hollsten as Flynn, the orphaned-at-birth woman blessed/cursed with powerful witch abilities. She's a relative newcomer, but the actress is definitely one to watch. And then the character I at first disliked, but later loved: Laughing Deer, an absolutely clinically insane sociopath of a warrior. He likes to hurt people and take things, and he doesn't pretend otherwise. While that's sometimes a recipe for a one-note boring character, voice actor Adam Gifford brings an unhinged, scenery-chewing depth to LD that I can't help but love. Voice directors: Please cast Adam Gifford to do more over-the-top characters. It doesn't hurt that Laughing Deer is also very, very fun to use in tactical combat. He's the reigning king of Bravado-fueled killstreaks: After all, you're never at the wrong angle for a killshot when you're in melee range. Built Hard, Kill't Hard Those characters are all set personalities – Hard West 2 has some character building aspects, and equipment to fiddle with, but make no mistake: This is very much a tactics game. The RPG elements are effectively limited to dialogue choices, there are no character levels, and nearly every character buff is transferable between missions from one party member to another. Those buffs  mostly come in the form of cards, which are mission rewards, of which any character can hold five. By forming poker hands with those cards you unlock more and more of a character's passive abilities and upgrade their active one. It's a delightful, thematic way to gear up and I absolutely loved it. What I didn't love was how rigid that felt. Each character is primed to be best at one or two specific things, and there's little-to-no reason not to gear them up for that and that alone. There are also some subpar designs mechanically, like Lazarus. Even though I loved his character, he has powers that revolve around when a party member goes down… in a game where all of the mainline story missions instantly fail if you lose a single character… even though there's no permadeath and most other missions let you lose as many as you want. Why would I use my precious few permanent upgrades on Lazarus when I can't reap the benefits in the hardest missions? The permanent upgrades come from making friends with your posse members, which happens in decisions out on the trail. Better friends get boosted abilities — and sometimes more dialogue options enabling different rewards and alternate paths during the text-driven world map quests. It's a nice source of character moments, but it feels bad to pick the dialogue you like when you know it'll hamstring you in combat. Hard West 2 is one of those times where I can pick out little things I didn't like all day, but whatever cracks exist in its game design or storytelling are plastered over by its impressive environments, world, and characters. For every shotgun blast I couldn't take or strategically narrow mission I had to restart there was at least one time I cackled madly while Cla'lish chained together headshots or Laughing Deer whooped madly while bashing in head after head after head. "
126,Two Point Campus ,8.0,"Two Point Campus continues in the already impressive footsteps of Two Point Hospital before it, dressing up an engaging business management sim in goofy irreverence. To be honest, its dorky, oddball sense of humor misses me more often than it hits. But that all fades into the background for the most part when I'm having a blast laying out my new library, planning out dorms, and throwing sweet parties in the student union. Most of the time you'll be juggling your budget, student happiness, and the space requirements of running a university. It's similar to Two Point Hospital in that last regard – making the best of annoying geometry to cram in an extra lecture theater or much-needed bathroom put my mental Tetris skills to the test, and often forced me to abandon the idea of a perfect layout in the interest of a functional one. That can sometimes get tiresome, but it's also not really an issue later on when you get some bigger plots and the ability to make buildings whatever shape you want. So by the time it had overstayed its welcome, I was given the much appreciated freedom not to deal with it anymore.  The Sandbox mode is where Two Point Campus really shines, letting you loose to build the school of your dreams on any of the 12 different themed plots. Some are outright wacky, like a spy school that uses a burger joint as a cover. Others are a bit more vanilla, like an Oxford-inspired campus in the faux-English countryside. And the same goes for the courses available, with everything from General Knowledge to actual Knight School – yes, that's Knight with a K. So you can kind of adjust your level of silliness to your preference, which is nice. Each campus is introduced through a story-driven scenario that includes its own special rules. I definitely liked some of these more than others. Funding my university entirely on plundered artifacts from an archaeological dig has a bit of an, ""Are we the baddies?"" vibe, but I found it entertaining. On the other hand, running a parody of a SoCal party school where my entire budget was based on how much fun the students were having became mechanically tedious pretty quickly due to the extremely small profit margins and low return on investment for all the expensive amenities I provided. You only have to clear five of these to unlock all 12 maps in sandbox mode, though. So if you're just not feeling the scenario objectives, they're easy enough to ignore. And once outside the bounds of the campaign, I enjoyed how progression works. Adding more facilities and staff, as well as leveling up your various rooms by adding decorations and more learning opportunities, will level up the whole university and provide more course points and ""Kudosh,"" a special currency that unlocks more cosmetic options and ploppable doodads. Course points can be spent to add new programs or expand existing ones, and that creates a rewarding feeling of going from a dingy backup school to a thriving university. Not all courses are built the same, either. The aforementioned Archaeology program lets you dig up artifacts that can be put on display to raise your campus' prestige, or sold to pad out your budget. Academic Exercise revolves around the sport of Cheeseball, where you can schedule games against rival schools and compete for glory. Not every course has its own minigame like this, but the ones that do effectively let you be more hands-on during a school year and create extra, thematic goals to strive for. The more nitty-gritty campus management aspects can be a bit frustrating, though. While the UI is legible and organized, it's sometimes hard to quickly find information I'd really like access to, like why a particular student has low grades. The Advice screen is very helpful in this regard, since it usually tells you what your biggest problems are in plain language. But it doesn't really help you understand how the systems work to allow you to spot those problems intuitively in the future. There are also a number of things I wish had tooltips that don't for some reason, like the Academic Overview. Overlays for all the various happiness and comfort factors are great, but again, they don't necessarily help you figure out why a problem exists – only that there is one. The visual style of Two Point Campus is almost identical to Two Point Hospital, and it’s one that makes everything very readable. It's also not exactly my vibe, though. Just like the humor often doesn't do it for me, rarely rising above what you'd find in a kids' joke book, the stylized and whimsical models and animations seem a bit like a playset you'd find in the Early Childhood section of a toy store. I don't need every game I play to look like a photorealistic, ray-traced military simulator, but I’m just not charmed by this particular aesthetic either. The theming of the various maps, on the other hand, does get me excited. Being able to have a knight school inside of an actual castle is pretty rad. There's enough diversity that whatever kind of university you can imagine, there's probably a plot that fits it well. I wish there were some more carpet and wallpaper options for some rooms, and the lack of the ability to make slanted or curved buildings is a little bit limiting. But the grid helps keep things simple and modular as well, so it's a trade-off. And I do enjoy personalizing everything with posters, landscaping, and statues. When it comes right down to it, Two Point Campus is a deep and rewarding management game. And that's what matters most here. Growing my college, hiring and training faculty, adding new courses, spiffing up my dorms, and watching my grades and profits soar in the Sandbox mode is addicting enough that I could keep at it for dozens of hours more, even after having put in almost 40 hours for this review. The art style and quirky humor don't really do it for me most of the time, but they're usually not actively obnoxious, and eventually I sort of just tuned them out. At the end of the semester, I'd pass Two Point Campus with a solid B+. "
127,MultiVersus ,8.0,"Few companies have the wealth of recognizable and exciting characters required to create a platform fighter that could rival the likes of Nintendo’s Super Smash Bros. series. With the help of developer Player First Games, Warner Bros. is trying to use the seemingly endless list of movie and TV studios it owns to do just that, bringing together an eclectic roster of fan-favorite characters that somehow includes Harley Quinn, Bugs Bunny, and Shaggy all at once. While the result makes for some gleeful multiplayer chaos, MultiVersus is ambitious in its laser focus on competitive multiplayer too. That’s left some of the more casual aspects undercooked, but its prioritization of 2v2 online matches still makes for a fresh take on an increasingly crowded genre. Unlike last year’s competent yet underwhelming Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, MultiVersus clearly has significant support from the Warner Bros. family and, more importantly, the budget to follow through on Player First’s vision. Not only are iconic faces like the DC superhero trinity of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman available to pilot, but so are characters from Steven Universe, The Iron Giant, and even Game of Thrones. The open beta’s initial roster of 17 is a tad small for my taste, but I’m not worried about it in the long term as the cast is already set to expand in the coming months – basketball and Space Jam superstar LeBron James was just added, and Rick and Morty are supposed to join him in August.  While compact, the roster is diverse and brimming with personality thanks to its impressively faithful voice cast. Having actors like John DiMaggio (Jake the Dog), Kevin Conroy (Batman), Matthew Lillard (Shaggy), and Maisie Williams (Arya Stark) reprise their roles goes a long way toward making these characters feel authentic. It’s great to hear the voices I remember from cartoons and movies I grew up on bantering with characters they’ve never had the chance to meet before. Beyond the recognizable, I dig additions like Reindog, too, an original creation that opens up the possibility for more new faces to join the fray down the line. Matches in MultiVersus play out as either 1v1, 2v2, or four-player free-for-all battles in places like a spooky Scooby Doo-inspired mansion or the gadget-ridden cavern of the Bat Cave. Unfortunately, the sparse selection of stages are bland and lack identity beyond those two standouts. The other three locations look like they could take place anywhere despite supposedly being based on memorable sites like the Adventure Time treehouse. Thankfully the music does help make up for this, and I look for any opportunity to brawl in the Sky Palace just to hear its wonderful instrumental cover of the Steven Universe theme. Like in Smash Bros., your goal is to build up damage on your opponent in order to make it easier to send them flying off into the void at the edge of the screen for a kill. Characters have two attack buttons to work with, representing normal hits and flashier special attacks, with different moves performed by pointing the analog stick up, down, or to the side while unleashing an attack. It’s recognizable, but a well-executed system, and controlling your character is as quick and fluid as I’d hope the chaotic gameplay of a platform fighter would be. I almost always feel in complete control, which can be attributed to the tight mobility options available to most of the roster. You can use double jumps and dodges to navigate the airspace, escape danger, avoid projectiles, or line up a devastating assault of your own. A change from the norm is a lack of ledge grabbing, which is why Player First has opted to enable wall jumps that make for exciting, daring saves by sticking to the side of the main platform and leaping to safety instead of falling to your doom. Another big departure is that the 2v2 mode is meant to be the main way to play, making MultiVersus refreshing and setting it apart from its peers. These team battles are a lot of fun, with each character assigned a class that promotes a specific playstyle to help compliment a partner. Whether that’s the frontline tanks, the hard-hitting bruisers, the agile and deadly assassins, or the trickier ranged mages and support classes; everyone has a role to play in a fight, and your team composition can be vital to succeeding against experienced challengers. It’s great fun discovering how Bugs Bunny and his toon gimmicks pair with the protection and crowd control provided by Wonder Woman’s moves. While I naturally gravitated towards tanks like Superman and The Iron Giant, I’ve also been having a blast learning the intricacies of playing support as Steven Universe and learning about each character to be a better teammate. With how important the online modes are to MultiVersus, the rollback netcode running remote multiplayer sessions has to be great, and it has been across most of the well over 100 matches I have under my belt. A large majority of fights have played out with smooth and responsive controls on PC and Xbox, both with wired and wireless connections. I have run into some issues online, although it’s fewer than I can count on one hand. However, in those rare times when a connection is bad, it’s chaotic and near unplayable, with characters warping around the stage or running aimlessly off a cliff only to appear a few seconds later just yards away. Thankfully, moments like that are the exception rather than the rule. You can equip up to four different perks before every match, adding a level of customization to enhance your playstyle, support your partner, or even try to counter your opponents’ team. Three of those can be perks that affect attributes like movement speed or damage dealt, which is amplified in power if your teammate equips the same one. Signature perks fill the fourth slot, modifying specific character attacks and abilities, such as leaving flame walls in the wake of Iron Giant’s jet boosters or Taz hacking up an anvil if he eats an enemy projectile. Perks add a meaningful layer of strategy to each match that I appreciate in every mode, but especially when I’m playing alongside someone I can build a gameplan with. The unfortunate side effect of that focus on competitive 2v2 is the absence of meaningful local multiplayer options. Currently, you can play with up to four people on one device in team battles and free-for-alls, just like online, but there isn’t enough here to keep my interest with friends if I want to have a chaotic anything-goes party experience. Items occasionally populate in the FFA game type, but none of the rocks, dynamite, and ice weapons are remotely entertaining to use or add surprising moments to the mayhem that’s already playing out. Local multiplayer also means the lack of stages is more glaring, making MultiVersus a disappointing game for casual fun overall. Characters and perks have to be unlocked, but thankfully MultiVersus takes a big step in the right direction when it comes to free-to-play fighting game monetization.  While the free-to-play model comes with a lot of negative connotations and possible pitfalls, it also has the potential to be a boon for fighting games by allowing more people to casually try a game without having to drop a dime on it if they don’t want to. And crucially, Player First has ensured everything that affects gameplay is accessible simply by playing, avoiding any pay-to-win concerns. Perks are only unlocked either by leveling up characters or by spending the free gold currency that’s earned from playing matches and completing various daily missions and reward tracks. Characters, on the other hand, can be bought with gold, the real-money premium currency called Gleamium, or Character Tickets which are available to those who buy the optional founders packs. Only four characters are unlocked from the start, but I’ve found playing just a couple of hours will earn enough gold to unlock someone new. There’s a nice pace to learning a character or two and then moving on to a new one when you have enough gold. Gleamium can be purchased in bundles of 450 ($4.99), 1000 ($9.99), 2200 ($19.99), and 6000 ($49.99). Variant costumes currently can cost 500, 800, 1500, or 2000 Gleamium depending on the rarity, and characters are each 700 Gleamium if you want to forgo paying the 1500-3000 free Gold. Character emotes can cost 200, 350, or 500 Gleamium depending on whether it's uncommon, rare, or epic rarity, respectively. Ringout animations are 800 Gleamium for rare and 1200 Gleamium for epic items. That means pretty much no matter what item you are looking to buy, the Gleamium bundles won't quite line up with the price.  Gleamium is also used to unlock multiple cosmetic items like character variant costumes, emotes, profile icons, ringout animations, and more. These cosmetics are fun, especially the skins that change the entire aesthetic of a character down to the voice lines, like the Cake the Cat costume for Jake. However, some of the pricing on these items don’t align well with the bundles of Gleamium that can be purchased, which forces you to buy more than needed – that’s not a new business practice, but it’s still a lame one. If you want to invest in Luau Velma or a Batman: The Animated Series skin, it’ll cost you. They’re by no means necessary to purchase, but if the right skin comes around, such as Black Lantern Superman, I’ll definitely be tempted to swag out my main fighter if the price is right. Not every cosmetic costs Gleamium, and there are other ways to snag some of these items in the free and premium season pass rewards and by leveling up each character. I love that these reasons to keep playing and engaging exist even if I’m not throwing down money. MultiVersus is a raucous and fun competitive platform fighter that rewards players for learning the strengths and weaknesses of its eclectic cast of characters and working as part of a team. Its focus on online 2v2 means it lacks the pick-up-and-play nature of a game like Smash Bros., but it also does a nice job of setting it apart from other games in the genre. MultiVersus may need time to grow its currently limited selection of stages and characters to meet its bright potential, but its foundations are already rock solid. "
128,Xenoblade Chronicles 3 ,8.0,"When it comes to over-the-top roleplaying games, it’s hard to beat the bonkers worlds and stories I’ve come to expect from the Xenoblade Chronicles saga. With Xenoblade Chronicles 3, massive improvements have been made to combat, quest design, and the RPG sandbox, while retaining the absurd and awesome environments, and a laser-focus on great characters and an impressive (if convoluted) story. Of course, while this third entry evolves in some key areas that make the epic journey more consistently fun than the two mainline games that came before it, it also repeats some of the same mistakes, including sloppy writing, weak bosses, and graphics that often leave something to be desired. Even so, Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is already competing for the spot as my favorite iteration of this beloved series.   At the heart of any Xenoblade game is a fantastically bizarre world and an epic story that’s propelled into utter insanity by the end, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is no exception. Everything about the war-torn world of Aionios is completely foreign, from the 10-year life spans the world’s pod-grown residents live, to the constant war to power up “flame clocks” that each faction draws life from, to the Off-Seers who play flutes to release the dead as sprites of light. All of these puzzling elements unravel over the course of the extensive adventure, and being a part of that journey is uniquely satisfying in a way only Monolith Soft seems capable of pulling off. Even those who have never played a Xenoblade game before will be able to enjoy this extremely self-contained story. There are definitely references and tie-ins to Xenoblade Chronicles 1 and 2, but they’re not crucial to anything so you aren’t likely to take notice of them at all unless you know what to look for. For those like myself who have been following along from the beginning, there’s plenty to enjoy that felt like a nice reward for keeping up with the series for all these years.  But while the story and world are delightfully weird, they aren’t always effectively used, especially when it comes to the extremely hit-or-miss writing that has characters retreading the same developments over and over again and beating you over the head with the story’s themes and ideas. The concepts and characters almost never stop shining, but it’s not always told with finesse, and oftentimes three lengthy cutscenes are used to accomplish what might have just as well been covered with a single line of dialogue. Some sections had so many exhaustive cutscenes occurring one after another that a painful sense of deja vu crept over me and dragged down what was an otherwise interesting development. Not to mention the fact that just about every anime story cliche in the book has been included in the maximum doses legally permitted. Add in some severe pacing problems, like one section that has you go undercover to perform menial tasks, or another that has you trotting across the world to collect pieces of metal, and I often felt like my time wasn’t being respected with so much filler padding out the adventure. Some of that is fine, but in a game that took 150 hours to complete it might’ve been better to trim out some of the unessential parts. The good news is that, even when the story drags a bit the characters shine brightly, with very few exceptions. Whether you’re hanging out with the brash meathead Lanz and his simple charms or spending time with the studious bookworm Taion, it was really hard for me to not grow to love the ragtag band of misfits and ne’er-do-wells that comprise your party. Sure, they aren’t the most original characters – I’ve definitely seen their like in half a hundred games and shows before – but after so many hours with these lovable scamps, I’ve come to regard them all as my chosen family. That’s especially true when each character is given so much time in the limelight, with every party member getting extensive personal histories and fully voice-acted optional side quests that flesh out their backstories and provide additional color. Even some of the less interesting members like Sena, the under-achieving jock who I considered the runt of the litter, still ended up winning me over in the end thanks to all the time and attention given to developing her.  Of course, it wouldn’t be Xenoblade without bizarre, otherworldly locations to adventure in, and the environments in this one are suitably odd. There’s one area that takes place inside of a giant discarded sword, and another that leads you along the branches of a massive tree. Exploring these areas as you unravel the mysteries of Aionios add to the unpredictability and weirdness of the world in a really awesome way. That said, compared to some of the bonkers destinations from previous Xenoblade games, the places you visit in this odyssey are mild by comparison. There are a few highlights, but nothing that comes close to climbing up a giant dead robot’s elbow or winding up inside the body of an ancient creature. Instead you mostly explore standard settings like a snowy area, a big, sandy desert, or a large body of water with some small islands. It still captures the spirit of exploration and discovery for which Xenoblade is known and there are certainly a few surprises, but I do find myself wishing the developers had gotten a bit weirder with it considering the series’ track record. It’s also unfortunate that, although Xenoblade 3’s environments are awesome to roam around in, they rarely look pretty due to the Nintendo Switch being pushed to its absolute limits by such an ambitious voyage. I played on my OLED model and switched between docked and mobile mode regularly, but even with Nintendo’s most recent hardware textures are often low-res, there’s frequent pop-in (and out), and oftentimes I just couldn’t help but feel like the world was a bit blurry. The good news is that I quickly got used to these visual shortcomings and, once I accepted it for what it was, it only rarely dampened my enjoyment. Thankfully cutscenes, at least, are crisp and the frame rate runs at a rock-solid 30 even when dozens of things are happening on-screen at the same time, but it’s still sorta disappointing to see such obvious hardware limitations in an adventure that reaches for the stars in so many other areas.  As you explore the world you’ll recruit new party members to your team, fight bizarre creatures, and distract yourself with dozens of hours of side quests that are mostly worthwhile. If you were annoyed by the fetch quests from previous games, you can look forward to the fact that Xenoblade 3 massively improves things in this regard by making many optional quests actually feel substantial by introducing new characters and offering some story snippets that make your effort worth the trouble. In my completionist playthrough I helped a nopon and a human put aside their differences across a series of missions, became best friends with a robot, and helped various settlements resolve their disputes. That said, there are still plenty of missions that feel very much like filler and have you running around collecting berries and rocks or some such nonsense, and those are as gut-wrenchingly unpleasant to do as they’ve ever been – though at least now you aren’t bombarded by them every five minutes. What’s especially impressive is that some side quests are so impactful that they almost feel like they should have been mandatory. Some end with you getting a new party member or triggering a cutscene that fleshes out an important area of a character’s backstory. And thankfully, most of these missions are even appropriately labeled so it’s easy to identify which ones you should go out of your way to do and which you’d be forgiven to skip. In an adventure that sometimes makes questionable decisions concerning how it uses all the time it demands from you, I was deeply grateful that I felt most of my time spent chasing around side quests was rewarded.  Similarly, numerous improvements have been made to the combat system that make it feel far less repetitive and more engaging than its predecessors. While the foundation of combining auto-attacks, super-powered Arts, and attack combos remains largely intact, a plethora of options have been added that successfully staves off stagnation for over 100 hours – and that’s no small feat! It’s accomplished with (among other things) six playable characters plus a guest NPC that can be swapped out, new transformations that combine two characters into their Ouroburos form making them almost impossible to take down for a limited period of time, and returning chain attacks, which let you deal a ton of damage by playing a simple minigame. As you travel around Aionios, you’ll encounter all manner of wild beasts, legendary creatures, bloodthirsty humans, and giant robots to fight. Not all enemies are created equal, and fighting against giraffe-like creatures that lazily kick at you doesn’t quite compare to robotic opponents whose movesets and animations make them feel like a lot more work was put into them. But the variety of things to slay at least gives you lots of new experiences throughout the journey.  There’s also an awesome new mechanic that lets characters trade classes with one another and with guest NPCs that have entirely different skill sets. In fact, doing so is incredibly important to progression because you gain new abilities by mastering the classes of your fellow party members. You might become an awesome healer with a laser gun or a soul-stealing boxer who takes abilities from powerful creatures you fell. Playing around with all the classes not only serves as an addictive loop that kept me busy throughout the adventure, but also helps break up some of the monotony we had to slog through in prior iterations of the combat system that tethered you to a single class and lacked variety. The drawback is that with so many new mechanics and all the complexity of everything Xenoblade Chronicles 3 juggles, you’ll quite frequently be interrupted to read through tutorial cards – and when I say “frequently” I mean those will keep coming at you quite literally until the very end… and even beyond the credits. Not only does this slow the journey in an irritating way, but it can be downright overwhelming to keep track of some many mechanics all at once. I’ve gotta believe there’s an easier way to get me to ingest all of that information without flash cards popping up like I’m studying for the LSAT.  Another major gripe I’ve always had with the series that continues to be a problem in Xenoblade 3 is how characters still shout the same lines over and over again, with no reprieve. I must have heard Eunie say “Hear that, Noah? Lanz wants something a bit meatier,” well over 500 times during my playthrough, and there doesn’t appear to be any way to turn combat dialogue off like you could in Xenoblade Chronicles Remastered. If this sounds like a minor complaint to you, then you most likely haven’t heard someone say the same phrase so many times that it’s become integrated into your very DNA. It’s seriously a harrowing experience, and I’ll never understand why this is still a problem in 2022. Boss fights are also a bit underwhelming, as you fight a lot of the same class of boss enemies who rarely have anything to differentiate them from one another. They really like throwing big purple humanoid demon creatures at you, for example, which gets quite old pretty fast. They’re also fans of making you fight the same boss twice in a row, with cutscenes serving as bookends between each encounter. And don’t even get me started on the numerous times you defeat a boss only to immediately enter a cutscene wherein the boss defeats you. I get that it’s a very common cliche in JRPGs (and specifically in Xenoblade as a series), but Xenoblade Chronicles 3 really abuses its privileges in this regard, to the point where I began to assume each victory over a boss was going to lead into a cutscene wherein I lose the fight. Put all that together and you end up with boss fights not really being something I looked forward to, even though combat against normal enemies is otherwise fantastic.  Xenoblade Chronicles 3 is another excellent JRPG with great characters, a unique world, and addictive tactical combat that remains entertaining even after the over 150 hours it took to complete it. For the first time in the series side quests are actually fun to do, and the class-swapping and Interlink Ouroburos mechanics keep the revised combat system feeling fresh long into the adventure. Plus, the story is worth seeing through to the end even though it’s overwritten and takes some meandering detours. At the same time there are a fair amount of odd game design choices, like its annoying and repetitive combat voice lines and uninteresting cookie-cutter boss fights, and it’s unfortunate that Aionios’ beauty seems held back by the Switch’s hardware. But none of that should deter you from going all-in on another fantastic odyssey in a series that is worthy of a massive amount of your time. "
129,Live A Live Review: Live Laugh L,9.0,"The curious RPG Live A Live is a fascinating time capsule of an era when RPGs were still experimenting heavily with structures and ideas, and its long-awaited remake proves that the best, weirdest efforts of that experimentation can still shine today. Its unusual story structure of seven different vignettes ranging from prehistory to the far, spacefaring future, is immediately striking after decades of grandiose, linear RPGs. And its initial disparate story threads are upheld and pulled together by its ensemble cast of lovable characters. But what truly makes Live A Live a triumph is the way it pulls its disparate threads together to subvert expectations of JRPGs not only as they existed in 1994 when it was first made, but somehow still almost three decades later in 2022. Most of the best things about Live A Live’s remake were present in its original form, which makes it all the more a shame it never made it to the West back in the ‘90s. That said, this remake would have been worth the effort even if we were already familiar with the story and gameplay. While the original was not the prettiest of Square’s RPGs even for its era, the HD-2D look pioneered by Octopath Traveler continues not to miss when it comes to wonderfully marrying sprite-based nostalgia with modern 3D capabilities. Live A Live is lovely, full of eye-catching color schemes and memorable snapshots where Square has used the depth of its 3D backgrounds to full effect. That could be in memorable moments like a shinobi running over rooftops against a violet twilight, or sparkling sunlight dripping into a castle throne room.    On the surface, all of Live A Live’s seven vignettes are disconnected, and it largely doesn’t matter which one you start or end with. You can even pick one up, put it down, start another, and return to the first later if it suits you; Live A Live will conveniently keep track of your progress in each story even if you save over a file, a feature I made a lot of use of as the discovery of numerous, fun hidden secrets prompted me to revisit chapters I’d thought I’d combed thoroughly. Not only do the different chapters take place in different eras, but each one distinguishes itself with unique characters and mechanics to suit them. In prehistory, for instance, language has yet to be invented, so all the storytelling brilliantly takes place with animation and imagery. Here and only here, the protagonist caveman Pogo can use his powerful sense of smell to track down the whereabouts of NPCs or enemies he’s looking for. The Edo period shinobi Oboromaru can cloak himself in shadow to hide from enemies and complete his entire chapter without killing a single human, or he can brutally murder his way through the manor he’s infiltrating. The Sundown Kid, a Wild West gunslinger, doesn’t fight nearly as much as the others – instead, he works with the local townsfolk to lay traps for the bad posse on its way to wreak havoc. Near Future’s Akira can read minds and teleport out of battle, though his teleport ability is intentionally a bit unreliable. Though quite different from one another, Live A Live’s ensemble cast all manage to endear themselves in their respective stories; I still can’t pick a favorite. The 2022 Live A Live remake’s characterization is further improved by the introduction of voice acting, which is present in all important story scenes. Both Japanese and English tracks are available, and while the English acting had some occasional awkwardness in chapters like Edo Japan, having voice acting at all was a net positive for an RPG so profoundly centered on building up an ensemble cast of interesting characters.  The unique flavors of each protagonist, era, and theme play out in battle, too. While all seven characters use the same grid system to move about the field and launch attacks at foes in turn-based combat, Live A Live manages to theme each protagonist’s moves in ways that effectively reflect their personality. Oboromaru – a ninja – uses lots of area-of-effect abilities to lay traps on the field and force enemies to either move or take damage. Sundown has a gun, so everything he does is long range. Imperial China’s Earthen Heart shifu master can pass on battle techniques to his students as he trains them, while Present Day’s Masaru Takahara learns martial arts moves from his enemies. In the Far Future, the supportive robot Cube doesn’t fight at all, except in an optional arcade game located on their spaceship. Learning the ways in which each of the seven diverse characters can take advantage of the same battle system over the course of Live A Live was one of its pleasures, and I was more than once impressed by the ways in which the marriage of combat and character either furthered the plot or told me something interesting about a character I loved. Each chapter’s enemies are designed around the respective character’s unique abilities, and the deceptively simple grid system reveals plenty of tricks up its sleeves. The deeper I dug into each chapter, the more I was forced to reckon with the grid not just as a means to get my attacks lined up, but also as a tool for predicting enemy moves and avoiding them so my team wasn’t decimated. Some chapters have additional nuances, such as enemy weaknesses and resistances to certain types of attacks, or enemy captains that take the whole rest of the team with them when destroyed. Don’t underestimate Live A Live’s battle system, especially if you want to go after the well-hidden handful of ultrahard secret bosses scattered throughout several of its chapters. Released originally in Japan in 1994, Live A Live’s non-linear ensemble adventure never officially made it West until now, but has nonetheless served to inspire numerous beloved RPGs that have come since. Octopath Traveler did eventually give the pitch its dues in 2018 (though arguably not as effectively), and it’s even easier to see in Live A Live the bones of what director Takashi Tokita would later bring back together in Chrono Trigger in a more traditional story structure. Live A Live’s influence has also clearly touched its less direct successors, from modern Square RPGs like the Bravely games to indies like Undertale. The latter’s creator, Toby Fox, has openly talked about how Live A Live boss theme, Megalomania, inspired his own now-famous boss tune, the aptly-named Megalovania. On a historical basis alone, Live A Live is a must for RPG lovers who want to get to know the curious ancestor of some of the most celebrated games in the genre. All of Live A Live’s battle and field mechanics play beautifully in the context of each respective chapter, many of which lean gently, but not obnoxiously, into popular film, TV, and even gaming tropes. In their early hours, you might recognize the plot of Far Future from some popular science fiction films, Present Day is a clear homage to arcade fighting games, Near Future debuts with all the bombast of a mech anime, and Imperial China plays out like a stereotypical kung fu feature…until, suddenly, they don’t. While some of the vignettes are certainly stronger than others, they all manage in different ways to subvert the tropes they’re embracing. Were Live A Live merely a collection of its initial seven separate vignettes with loosely connected themes and ideas, I’d have walked away happy enough with my experience. But, wonderfully, there’s more. I don’t want to spoil Live A Live for those who are unaware of its biggest twists from the original ‘94 Japan release, and if you’re in that camp, I’m begging you to go in without looking anything up. What I can tell you is this: The best thing about Live A Live is the way it made me suspicious of what it was actually about, and then proved my suspicions correct before turning them on their head. As I played through these vignettes and reached their various endings, I quickly noticed a very obvious common thread between them, and expected that thread to reward me once I finished them all with something fairly obvious and RPG-like – an extra boss battle maybe, or a cutscene or two. What I got was a full 10 hours more of video game on top of the 15 or so it had taken me up to that point, stuffed with several major twists, deeply emotional and triumphant moments, multiple secrets and sidequests, and (heck yeah) multiple endings depending on the choices I made throughout. Thank you, Square Enix, for 20 separate save slots.  My biggest issue with Live A Live, sadly, lay in that second half. While most of the seven vignettes are fairly tight, concise stories (except perhaps Near Future with its unnecessary errand-running around an orphanage), its final act is full of obnoxiously grindy random battles that slow its momentum to a crawl. I cannot fathom why the last hours use this mechanism, when literally any other battle system, including avoidable enemies roaming the overworld or even just a toggle to turn encounters off, would have done fine. Hardly any of the other vignettes include random battles, and while there’s a certain amount of fighting I needed to do to face the final challenge, there was a clear point at which grinding became trivial and I was running from fights every five to 10 seconds or so. In Live A Live’s defense, I do see how the excessive random battles are playing on a genre trope it otherwise very effectively subverts, but at a certain point that trope falls away and is just exhausting. Which is a shame, because this segment was the part of Live A Live where I was consistently on the edge of my seat, wanting to know what would happen next. I don’t think the excessive random encounters dramatically damaged my enthusiasm, but given how utterly un-grindy the first 15 hours are, it’s certainly a frustration I’d recommend that you prepare yourself for – especially if you (like me) want to visit all the optional dungeons and explore all the secrets available in the late game. Those just booking it to the final battle will have an easier time. I can’t forget to mention the soundtrack by Yoko Shimomura of Kingdom Hearts fame and much more. Her original score for Live A Live was excellent on its own, and with modern audio capabilities and her own 2022 revisions it’s only gotten better. The boss theme, Megalomania, is rightfully remembered as being among her best work, and I’ve had the remake version playing on loop for days now. Live A Live is a fascinating piece of JRPG history that’s more than worthy of the energy Square Enix has spent to remake it for a global audience with a beautiful new art style decades later. Its unusual vignette structure and lovable ensemble cast are a delight to spend time with, especially thanks to the addition of voice acting, and the ultimate story payoff remains surprising and stand-out among JRPGs even decades after its original iteration. Its seven different characters each make inventive and surprising use of the deceptively simple combat system, which adds even more flavor to the most challenging optional boss fights. The remake could have put a bit more work into mitigating some of the original’s more tedious grinds toward the end, but by the time that grind kicks in, Live A Live had enough hooks stuck in me that I couldn’t put it down until I’d jammed out to Megalomania for the final time. "
130,PowerWash Simulator ,7.0,"Some games hide mystery in their titles, practically begging for every narrative thread to be pulled on to discover the secrets behind those words. PowerWash Simulator is not like this. Its direct name reveals that it is exactly what you think it is: the chance to live out your fantasy(?) as a water gun for hire, moving from job to job until all the dirt is blasted into oblivion. There's not a great deal of variety in such a career, and monotony can sink in, but a fundamentally simple yet satisfying style of gameplay provides a great way to chill out across numerous generously sized levels. Yes, it is just simulating the usually mundane act of hosing down your patio once a year, but PowerWash Simulator elevates itself above what could so easily become tedium by subtly gamifying the chore and shoving the most annoying parts under the rug. Anyway, let's try not to get too philosophical about it: Here's my review, in which I analyse a game about washing a 30-foot high shoe. There’s something therapeutic about PowerWash Simulator. Maybe it's because, at the time of writing, I'm sweltering in 39 °C (102°F) weather and incapable of moving without sweat clouding my vision, but the sheer amount of water being blasted onto the screen is borderline intoxicating. It's like a form of visual white noise, and I've lost hours on end to this meditative sim about nothing more than taking your time to clean the hell out of whatever is put in front of you. It removes all the irritations of real-life power washing - lugging a bulky machine around, tripping over extension cables etc. - focusing instead of the act of sending water screaming into a wall. The complete lack of music and voice acting only adds to the calm, with only the sound of water breaking the silence – aside from the 'ding' noise that sounds each time an object is fully clean which adds a real Pavlovian edge to proceedings.  Each job starts the same way: a scene resembling the aftermath of a Splatoon round where the brown team won faces you, and your mission is to clean the mess and return it to its original spotless state. If you're feeling a bit obtuse you could even call it a first-person shooter – if the aliens or army men were replaced with inanimate plastic flower pots and delicate wooden trellises, that is. During the surprisingly lengthy career mode of more than 20 hours you’re faced with building your small business up as you take request after request, cleaning up buildings and vehicles before reinvesting your earnings into better power washers and their accompanying attachments and soaps. You repeat the same routine no matter the job at hand, equipping the widest angle of the five available nozzle types to blast away large swathes of dirt on bigger surfaces before dialling in a more aggressive, narrow nozzle to deal with the finer details. A more concentrated burst of water is needed to get rid of those extra-stubborn materials – lichen, moss, rust – you know the stuff. You do have to change your angle in order clean gunk out from various grooves, nooks, and crannies, but that’s about it. It really is the definition of a rinse-and-repeat job – low on challenge, but reliant on sound methodology. It’s a highly satisfying loop though, as a daunting 100-square-foot roof gradually becomes a clean slate to be proud of – not before leaving a second-rate Jackson Pollock and childlike messages in the dirt, that is. A majority of the levels are extensive, often taking well over an hour to scrub to 100% and gain that valuable five-star rating. And with 38 jobs in total, there’s a significant amount to keep you busy. The more stars you collect in career mode, the more complex the levels you unlock. Earning both stars and cash is how you progress, allowing you to splash your earnings on better power washer equipment to make future jobs that much easier. Progression may be limited to only a few options over the course of the whole campaign, but the tangible improvements to each tool can be felt - with each, more expensive, power washer increasing in power. That being said, there's not a great deal of experimentation needed and I soon settled on my loadout of choice, complete with a long extension that maximised the washer's range, and the second-widest angle nozzle, which offers a satisfying balance between pressure and area of effect. I enjoyed it so much that I even found myself blurting out the phrase ""25-degree nozzle OP!"" as I hosed down the side of a fire station, like I was on a rampant Call of Duty killstreak. I must have looked like an idiot. Cleaning liquids – one for each relevant surface such as metal, wood etc. – can be applied, but come in fairly short supply, so have to be used smartly to maximise their effect. While they do make some challenges a bit simpler, in truth I neglected them for the most part, favouring a sharp burst of water instead as it just felt more enjoyable due to the satisfying nature of the blasts and the base level of skill it encourages. Tools, such as ladders and scaffolding, can be moved around each area to help reach dirt in high places and get a new blasting angle, which adds a light puzzle element but nothing that strays too far into challenging territory. Very occasionally, the levels themselves throw something different into the mix as well to keep things moderately fresh. Examples include a mansion that tests your sniping skills as you clean it from a distance behind a gated wall, and a carousel which requires you to turn it on and off – making it rotate – in order to scrub every inch of dirt. These challenges are few and far between though, and require spending only a little more brain power than usual. In truth, PowerWash Simulator is not a game that’s worried about difficulty spikes or introducing complex mechanics, but much more at home treating us to a relaxing, casual affair. In this endeavour, it often found a sweet spot that kept me coming back for more. Every so often, frustration can set in when trying to find the smallest speck in quite a large area, though. I found myself scouring the seemingly endless floor of a skatepark looking for smudges of dirt with a highlighting tool in a manner not dissimilar from using a UV light to uncover the more unsavoury stains at a crime scene. However, it’s a bit less exciting than that because the only crimes being committed here are unforgivable levels of uncleanliness on show from whoever owns these properties. Maps range from the mundane to the fantastical, with riffs on fairytale homes, a suitably red-dusted Mars rover, and a statue from an ancient civilization. There’s a very loose plot to trace, but PowerWash Simulator clearly isn’t too worried about telling a great story – it’s all about getting you cleaning as varied and interesting a set of buildings and vehicles as possible. It's not taking itself too seriously, and it would be frankly bizarre if it did, with some genuinely amusing moments coming from the texts you receive from clients and their oddball messages. There’s no voice acting to interrupt the silence. Outside of the single-player campaign, there’s the option to play the whole of career mode with a friend in co-op, or any job unlocked in free-play with up to five other players. There are no competitive options aside from racing against the clock to clean like the wind in the challenge mode, but it does serve as a relaxing space to treat as a chat room while you subconsciously hose down a carousel inexplicably covered in a field’s worth of mud. By most standards, PowerWash Simulator doesn’t offer the level of variety or progression you’d hope for, but there’s something just undeniably cathartic about the whole experience. Is it going to trouble the likes of Elden Ring in the game of the year race? No. Am I ready to pack in all this writing nonsense, rent a power washer, and start a new career as a water-fuelled saviour in a blue boiler suit? No. Did I have a highly relaxing time cleaning building after building to within an inch of their life? Absolutely. I may only be 30 years of age, but have come to fully accept that this is my life now – a man who cleans bungalows for fun. Join me. "
131,Stray ,8.0,"Silent protagonists are nothing new in video games, but Stray certainly pushes that concept to an interesting place. Part platformer, part traditional adventure game, this cyberpunk world full of neon-soaked robots transforms into a giant jungle gym from your perspective, which is just one foot off the ground. The concept of putting you in the paws of an average cat may be a silly one on the surface, but Stray uses that furry vehicle to tell a genuinely compelling story with some entertaining action along the way. Not all of its ideas land on their feet, but it was impossible to shake the fuzzy feeling it gave me right from the adorable opening minutes. To be clear: you’re not a magic cat, not a mutated sci-fi cat, not some kind of sentient super cat – just a normal, cute cat, albeit one that displays the sort of intelligent awareness we all like to pretend our own cats do when we aren’t looking. The simplicity of that concept works wonderfully, especially because the fact that you are a cat doesn’t actually matter all that much to the artificial people you interact with or the things you are asked to do. The robotic denizens of this cyberpunk world generally talk to you like they would anybody else, and the only way it’s ever really relevant to the story or the action is because you can fit into tight spaces they can’t.  At the same time, Stray revels in the fact that it has made you a cat. Your feline form brings a lovely and lighthearted flavor to this otherwise dark world, and there are moments all throughout that encourage you to set aside your responsibilities and simply play. Walls and carpets can be scratched at, knees can be lovingly rubbed against, objects can be heartlessly pushed off shelves, and there’s a dedicated meow button that I rarely stopped pressing. You can also find serene spots to curl up and take a nap, letting the camera pull out and giving you a moment to enjoy a nicely staged scene alongside one of the many impressive songs in Stray’s excellent futuristic soundtrack. This is a wonderfully rich world, one I really enjoyed learning all about. While your cat’s own story is a pretty simple tale of a lost adventurer trying to get home, the conflict you end up stumbling into is very well told. The beautifully designed city you have to make your way through is bleak without feeling pessimistic, full of history to learn and charming robot citizens to chat with despite the fairly dystopian situation around them. I talked to everyone I could, whether they were relevant to the story or not, and I loved seeing what their computer screen faces would display as I excitedly meowed around their feet, be that annoyance, surprise, or just a big heart. When you’re not sleeping on a pillow, Stray generally puts you in one of two types of situations: you’ll either be running through fairly linear levels full of amusing platforming challenges and some light puzzle solving, or exploring one of its more open town areas where you’ll collect items, talk to friendly robots, and complete tasks for them. The former sections almost reminded me of something like a 3D version of 2016’s Inside, with relatively simple obstacles being elevated by the exemplary atmosphere built around them. The latter sections, on the other hand, shift Stray into a genre more akin to a point-and-click adventure game – except in this case your pointer is a cat. In either case, moving around as a cat isn’t always quite as fluid as I hoped it would be. It’s fun to scamper up air conditioners mounted to the sides of buildings or walk along railings, but you don’t actually have a dedicated jump button to do any of that with. Instead, you can press a button to hop to predetermined interactable spots automatically when prompted. That means the only difficulty associated with any of the platforming is wrestling the camera into the right position to hop to the spot you want, and you don’t exactly move with the nimbleness of a cat once you do – though that’s partly the fault of the movement animations themselves, which can be noticeably stiff at times. The linear sections are still quite enjoyable despite their straightforward ease, kept interesting to the end of the five hours it took me to beat Stray by constantly introducing fresh ideas and environments. There are exciting chase scenes as you run from mutated creatures called Zurks, stealth sections as you avoid security drones, and puzzles where you might have to lure the enemy AI to your advantage. Not all of these ideas are as successful as others – the weakest of them gives you a weapon to kill the Zurks, which quickly devolves those previously tense encounters into a pattern of killing a few and then running backwards while you recharge it over and over – but they are all clever enough to refresh the platforming throughout. Exploring the small towns between these sections is a lot of fun from a four-legged perspective too, with each area sporting a surprisingly dense layout full of nooks and crannies to sniff out and a great use of vertical space. While the main quest will send you running around them on its own, there are also plenty of optional collectibles and questlines that I enjoyed stumbling upon just as much. Some might have you tracking down the combination to a hidden safe in classic adventure game fashion, while another has you collecting sheet music for a musician bot to play back to you. There’s a lot to find, and some collectibles are hidden well enough that I didn’t manage to uncover them all on my first playthrough – so there’s definitely at least a bit more than five hours of worth of stuff to do if you want to find every last secret. Assisting you with the less paw-friendly tasks is B-12, an equally adorable floating robot companion who hangs out in your backpack. B-12 accompanies your cat for most of the campaign, and the relationship that forms between them is a nice cornerstone for the plot as a whole. It’s as much B-12’s story as it is the cat’s – even more so, honestly, making your cat feel more like a furry avatar in someone else’s tale a lot of the time. That’s not necessarily a bad thing though, and writing for B-12 and the rest of the robots you meet is more than good enough to make up for the limited conversational skills of your purr-otagonist. B-12 doesn’t get all of the interactive glory, either, as I enjoyed when initially superfluous cat actions were occasionally repurposed into actual game mechanics. For example, you might need to get someone to open a door for you by scratching at it or wake someone up by knocking something off of a shelf above them. Later on, the meow button I had been incessantly pressing with no consequences up until that point could suddenly alert a guard to my presence, which would have been dire if I hadn’t been appropriately hiding in a cardboard box. Again, none of these tricks were ever very complex or challenging, but they were entertaining all the same.  Stray is a delightful adventure in a dark but endearingly hopeful cyberpunk world, and that’s thanks in no small part to the fact that you are playing as an adorable cat the whole time. Its mix of simple platforming and puzzles with item-hunting quests is balanced very well across the roughly five-hour story – and though I wished my movement was a little more nimble during that time, I still loved hopping across rooftops and scampering through back alleys to find its well-hidden secrets. The new ideas it introduces along the way help keep things as fresh as a new bag of litter, too, even if not all of those ideas work quite as well as others. But whether I was scratching at a carpet or curling up into a ball and taking a catnap, Stray does a great job of setting itself apart in a way that feels like more than just a novelty. "
132,As Dusk Falls ,9.0,"At first glance, Two Rock, Arizona is merely a backwater town occupied by little more than tumbleweed and a few rows of houses. But very little is as it first appears, and all it takes to reveal As Dusk Falls’ many layers of storytelling depth is one small, decades-spanning tragedy. And it’s all about the story, since this is a choose-your-own-adventure-style graphic novel that cleverly pulls ideas from games like Telltale’s The Walking Dead series and 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim. Each member of this voice-acting cast of unique and interesting characters has their own, often conflicting emotional stakes that accelerate the story in seemingly hundreds of logical and intelligently connected directions. Through the powerful and often far-reaching consequences of your own actions, this small town is gradually unveiled as a powder keg full of secrets, vices, and familial bonds that run far deeper than any outsider is initially led to expect.   This story begins with a heist carried out by a trio of brothers who, while searching for a place to lay low, collide with another family at the auspicious Desert Dream Motel. You initially alternate between the soft-spoken youngest brother, Jay, and Vince, a married father who can either care more about his troubled professional history or his family – depending on how you choose to play him. The voice acting is several steps above competent, featuring familiar names like Deus Ex’s Elias Toufexis and Returnal’s Jane Perry, just to name a few, and each character is played with believable conviction. For a game with this much melodrama, very little of it is played awkwardly, and that’s a huge positive. The orange-hued art style certainly harkens back to shows like Breaking Bad, and the painterly finish is reminiscent of Disco Elysium as well. Some might take umbrage with this art style, but arguably, that’s what makes it stand out so well against other story-focused games, where the uncanny valley might make it a little too difficult to take certain scenes seriously. Once I got used to it, my imagination began to fill in the gaps between frames. As a result, I remembered many of the scenes in much richer detail than they actually appeared. These characters and their motivations can vary wildly depending on the order of actions you choose, such as confronting a mugger with a shotgun or attempting to reason with him. Everybody has their own view on Two Rock and its history, and if the story begins to paint one non-player character as a villain, things rarely stay that way for long. The moral tug-of-war is constant here, and you may just want to play the six-hour campaign several times; not because you need to, but because taking different paths and exploring these wildly different stories is so satisfying. It’s great that As Dusk Falls points out which decisions are the big ones with a giant sign overhead, but don’t just assume the most obvious choice will always have the desired outcome. These cascading events are a constant source of twists and turns, meaning things can spin out of control in ways you usually didn’t intend, and practically none of the core cast is safe. It’s also easy to jump back to a decision that didn’t go your way if you’re picky about how you want a playthrough to go.  The likelihood you’ll manage to see everything meaningful on the first run is slim to zero, and the availability of an up to eight-player mode where everyone gets to vote on decisions make As Dusk Falls much more of a party game than any other visual novel to date. People can even vote using their phones. In the right circumstances and with the right group of people, it could be one of the most replayable visual novels to date. Fans of TV crime dramas would feel right at home in Two Rock, and the pace is so leisurely that even if your friends and family members aren’t typically into video games, this could be a great starting point for them. It’s the storyline that’s intense here, not gameplay; interaction is largely dominated by quick-time events and dialogue choices with a countdown timer that’s usually pretty generous. The meat of this story campaign is in exploring the plethora of story choices and then watching their often clever and sometimes tragic outcomes woven together with a story so well-written that it might as well be on AMC. Since no time is wasted making you search for puzzle clues or awkwardly stumble around in a 3D environment, As Dusk Falls leaves space for a noticeably wider number of meaningful decisions than in any Telltale game, and they don’t just feel like they’re giving the mere illusion of choice. Some actions, such as talking to a dog versus throwing a stick to ward the dog away, resulted in two vastly different outcomes that temporarily changed the shape of the story. In another instance, a series of events led to one character’s death early on, whereas making a totally different array of choices led to a completely different outcome near the end of the story. Many of these decisions seem innocent or meaningless at first, but they do tend to coalesce and influence the overall direction of events. Something you did four hours ago might pop up again, or not. As a result, when I saw a chain of earlier decisions come together to form larger consequences it felt ethereal.  The self-awareness across As Dusk Falls’ several layers of cascading events is impeccably consistent, but this is still just sleight of hand on the writers’ part, and like in any other story game with branching storylines, the skeleton of the plot remains pretty consistent throughout. Certain events will happen no matter what, though the silver lining here is that you may get a chance to see those events from a totally different angle if you make different choices. For example, a character who died early in my first playthrough lived long enough to disclose a secret later on in the second, and that revelation completely redefined how I viewed the story and some of the other characters. This led me to believe As Dusk Falls isn’t playing anything close to its full hand in the first six hours.  Tying these still images together is excellent sound design that accurately depicts everything with cinema-like fidelity. The original soundtrack by Forest Swords is rich, deep, and tense – coming in at ideal intervals, for example, to create drama with bassy tones.  The quick-time events could be done a little bit more imaginatively, however, since they only ever really come down to the basic “move a cursor or quickly tap a button” prompts, and they tend to show up in some very strange places, such as scenes where your character is doing something as basic as packing boxes. At least it gives you something to do during quieter moments. But overall, As Dusk Falls feels conventional in this area, and after having played Disco Elysium and 13 Sentinels, both of which took the whole concept of interactive fiction and turned it on its head in unique ways, it’s safe to say that Interior/Night wasn’t exactly willing to go skydiving without a parachute during the getaway scene. Yes, that was a reference to Point Break. But anyway, it isn’t reinventing the wheel, and its quick-time events would be downright boring if the story wasn’t so compelling. As Dusk Falls is a masterwork of branching storytelling that makes the best out of its comic book-style animations, which end up giving you the opportunity to fill the negative space with your imagination – and this works surprisingly well during some of the more intense scenes. It’s an impressive solo experience, but its eight-player mode makes it a potential hit at family or friend gatherings where gamers and non-gamers mix. Its many possible choices, mixed with the emotional intensity of its expressive voice cast make it a great recommendation for fans of crime dramas like Breaking Bad and Fargo. Virtually no one is safe from the consequences of your actions, but even if you make a choice that results in an unwanted consequence, or mess up one of many simplistic quick-time events, the story can still manage to spiral out in several interesting directions that you won’t expect, even on subsequent playthroughs. That makes it a joy to approach again and again until you uncover each character’s secrets and mentally reconstruct the story’s bigger picture. "
133,Neon White ,8.0,"A brash blend of lightning-quick platforming, fast and frantic combat, and a peculiar, card-based resource system, Neon White is a slick and special speedrunning FPS that’s simple to understand but hard to put down. Think Doom Eternal’s platforming sections, only replace the grim hellscapes with the floating architecture of an abstract heaven and you’re part of the way there. Add a little of Trials HD trying to ride the perfect route over the corpse of Mirror’s Edge and you’ll be even closer. With its precise and elegant controls and its uncanny ability to make even an average shooter player feel lithe and lethal it’s extremely easy to get lured into Neon White’s loop, even if the story stitching it all together immediately overstays its welcome. Neon White’s oddball premise – which sees sinners plucked from purgatory to serve as parkour pest-exterminators, clearing out a demon infestation in heaven as part of an annual contest where the winner gets to remain there – certainly sounds interesting on paper. In practice, however, it makes a large portion of Neon White a young adult visual novel where a bunch of brightly-coloured, dead millennials reminisce about their past lives and argue a bunch. I do appreciate the effort to slow down and add context to the 12 chapters and 97 levels developer Angel Matrix has built here – rather than just machine-gunning them directly into our veins non-stop, that is – but overall Neon White’s slightly over-assertive blend of pop-punk Christianity and off-brand anime didn’t grab me. You can fast-forward through it, but it’s always there.  This makes for a lot of chat to wade through outside of the otherwise impeccable puzzle platforming, delivered by a cast of goths, gym bros, and cloud-riding capsule toys that are as irritating as they are horny. There’s the titular White, a spindly-legged man who wears three belts – none of which appear connected to his trousers – and who likes to stand with his shoulders pulled back and his crotch thrust forward. Then there’s Violet, a knife-wielding pixie with an infantilised voice that’d open a remote garage door, and who seems like the kind of woman who’d dot the i’s on her ransom letters with love hearts. There’s also a cigar-chomping cat, a BDSM redhead in a collar, and a spiky-haired meathead. It’s like the first page of a Deviantart search up in here. If this is exactly what you’re after, you’re in luck.  For me, I honestly can’t tell whether the dialogue is deliberately bad or accidentally bad – but I guess it’s probably immaterial, because there’s no real difference in the end result. Despite the fact there are vast slabs of this visual novel regularly wedged throughout Neon White, it’s a testament to the quality of the action itself that it’s well worth enduring. Inside the levels themselves Neon White takes on a completely separate identity, where the hokeyness is elbowed aside for some absolutely razor-sharp FPS action. The objective? Kill all enemies and reach the exit as quickly as possible. The catch? Each level is a parkour puzzle, and reaching the end within the allotted time limits requires judicious juggling of the finite weapon and ability cards. Why are they cards? Other than allowing White to briefly look like an edgy street magician in the intro movie, I don’t know – but it works. Each card grants White the limited use of a weapon, alongside the use of a one-time secondary ability. The pistol turns into a double-jump, the rifle a high-speed air-dash, and the machine gun a destructive grenade that doubles as a vertical boost. Shotguns turn White into a sailing fireball, rocket launchers become grappling hooks, and SMGs become devastating ground pounds. Using an ability to clear a gap, breach an obstacle, or destroy an enemy burns the card that granted it – but there’s always another. The beauty of Neon White is that the precise assortment of cards you’ll need to nail a level is always there – it’s just up to you to gather and execute them all in the perfect spots. This ended up being a lot less intimidating than I’d feared as there’s a very well-considered visual language at work within Neon White. With sharp and simple graphics and very deliberate use of colour, Neon White usually makes it quite clear which direction you need to travel, the barriers you can smash, and the gaps you need to leap. It’s remarkably intuitive, seeping its way into my brain before I’d even realised it. There were definitely instances where I’d find myself jumping into a void during a first run through a level and dying without a clear idea of where I was supposed to be headed, but these were exceptions. As a result, Neon White boasts not only a marvellous sense of momentum, but also a fantastic ability to flatter you. There were certainly many occasions during Neon White where I felt like the greatest dead parkour assassin in the universe; breathless moments where I’d reached the end of a level and picked up my trophy by bounding and blasting by the seat of my pants, and playing the footage back felt like watching someone else playing. Someone much better than me. For an entirely unexceptional shooter player, Neon White’s capacity to make you feel like you look good playing it is a real credit. Better still, the faster you go, the more it encourages you to keep improving – first by giving you your own ghost to chase, and next by revealing new shortcuts to you. After mastering the moves I found myself searching for other hidden jumps and bits of level geometry that could be scaled or exploited. It hooks you into its just-one-more-try loop. Levels can take between 10 to 20 seconds to a few minutes, although the sweet spot seems to be around a minute-or-less. The longer levels and boss battles towards Neon White’s end do introduce a potent new card and some new traversal techniques, but I found these pretty tiresome on account of their punishing lengths. With no mid-level checkpoints by design (and extremely limited health) the longer levels are honestly just more frustrating than fun.  Neon White is a quick and compulsive first-person platformer that’s surprisingly simple to understand and play, but packs a very stern speedrunning challenge at its core. Tying your combat options to your traversal mechanics, Neon White makes every encounter a deadly parkour puzzle that can be replayed over and over, in search of the perfect run and the tightest time. The dialogue between its unlikeable troupe of angst-ridden, anime-inspired assassins may be a hokey misstep, but its airtight level design and fantastic sense of momentum ensure Neon White’s gameplay is something to celebrate. "
134,F1 22 ,8.0,"It’s a new era for the world of Formula 1, with some of the biggest changes seen in the sport in four decades shaking up not only the status quo, but also the spines of the drivers as teams wrestle to rein in the engineering quirks of this year’s new cars. Codemasters has followed suit with F1 22, stopping short of infusing this season’s back-busting porpoising phenomenon into its handling model but tinkering just enough with its reliably robust annual racer that it does feel sufficiently refreshed in a number of the right areas – even if the overall package is bound to be a pretty familiar one to returning fans. Rest assured, there is more to F1 22 than simply a stable of the latest cars and the new Miami circuit. Visually it’s treading water this year but small touches, like neat new post-race clips of the battle-worn cars and updated camera angles on the old podium celebrations, slightly rejuvenate parts of the Codemasters F1 series that have been stagnant for many years. The new race engineer voice and the ability to switch out commentator David Croft for Alex Jacques similarly help set F1 22 apart from the previous F1 games, which have been feeling increasingly recycled in this department. A new adaptive AI mode joins the standard and already huge list of driver aids and accessibility options, and seems to keep the pack within striking distance of less-experienced racers. This should make for more exciting racing regardless of skill. I watched my eight-year-old duke it out with the adaptive AI and while I can’t quite observe the full difference between the two available levels of it, it did seem to keep him in the hunt without making the AI rollover entirely.  Bigger bullet points, like the welcome inclusion of the F1 sprint race format and slick VR support for PC players, are obviously harder to miss. The F1 series is quite late to the table when it comes to VR support so I think it’s unlikely veterans of other, existing VR racing games will be wowed in quite the same way we were some years ago – but the novelty value of having it available in the official F1 series is very strong. With its dedication to replicating the minutiae of the real thing – from the paddock to the track – the F1 series has been a wonderfully immersive recreation of the world’s premier motorsport for some time. Experiencing it through a VR lens is doubly so. However, not every new feature of F1 22 earns a spot on the podium. With Codemasters confirming earlier this year that further instalments of the ‘Braking Point’ story mode it introduced in F1 2021 are on a two-year cadence, F1 22 does not include the next chapter of the studio’s airbrushed yet earnest take on a fictional, behind-the-scenes F1 fairy tale. In its place is F1 Life, a lifestyle-oriented mode focused on customising your F1 driver’s outfit and living areas, but it feels so vapid that it largely amounts to little more than a monetisable backdrop for the main menu screens. F1 22 puts the focus on this new mode by throwing you straight into tinkering with F1 Life’s default settings on first launch. The good thing about this is that afterward… it can be entirely ignored, and doing so ultimately doesn’t diminish anything about the typically robust racing experience around it. At best F1 Life seems like a catch-all to justify a steady stream of rewards for your time playing, only those rewards are often just bits of furniture and floor tiles. At worst, it’s a mechanism that’s here to shake some loose change out of people willing to hand over a few bucks for a cosmetic trinket. Other players can visit your space, but I don’t really understand why they’d want to. It’s probably a sad sign of the times that while previous F1 games featured iconic cars from the sport’s history, F1 22 features an extensive set of… designer rugs, lounges, and lamps. No one’s been excited about a lamp since Jafar played fullback for Agrabah. In theory I understand the desire to capture a taste of that lucrative, off-track luxury that real-life F1 superstars get to enjoy – and, yes, I did get momentarily distracted by the V6 coffee table – but I don’t know if adding interior decorating and the ability to dress your driver avatar like an aspiring Puma activewear influencer was the perfect way to do that. The addition of collectable supercars feels a little closer to the kinds of extravagant toys real-life F1 drivers can afford, and there is at least a gameplay component attached to these. Taking some broad inspiration from the Pirelli Hot Laps programme that runs at real grands prix – where F1 drivers are conscripted to hurl expensive exotics around the tracks with various VIPs aboard – F1 22 includes high-end supercars from Ferrari, AMG, Aston Martin, and McLaren for both hot-lapping, and a selection of bespoke driving challenges. They’re an interesting novelty – very different from anything present in previous F1 games – but in practice they do become a bit one-note and I eventually found myself opting to skip them. Through no fault of anyone, the supercars themselves are comparatively soggy when measured up to the purpose-built open-wheelers that represent the pinnacle of current F1 engineering, but they do convey a decent enough sense of speed, grip, and weight when compared to their contemporaries in rival racers. The drifting is surprisingly unspectacular, though; a severe lack of smoke leaves it feeling oddly sterile. F1 2021 is the best-looking and most customisable instalment of the long-running Codemasters series to date, and the ability to tinker under the hood of the core career experience and play co-op with a friend is very welcome. With the addition of Braking Point it’s also arguably the boldest F1 game so far. The characterisation is a little underdone and the E for Everyone approach means it’s quite an airbrushed take on the F1 world compared to Netflix’s tense and profanity-laden Drive to Survive, but injecting a story mode into the F1 series was a risk well worth taking and I’m certainly looking forward to more of it. The real stars of F1 22, of course, are the new F1 cars, which are the sleekest looking in many years, though saddled with a few interesting handling idiosyncrasies that demand some adjustments from F1 2021. With their bigger wheels and tyres, plus their added bulk, 2022’s F1 cars are the heaviest they’ve ever been. They’re also lower and stiffer, with less top-body downforce and a renewed focus on ground effect aerodynamics sucking the cars into the asphalt the faster they go. In F1 22 this has translated to cars that feel like they’ve lost a fraction of their nimbleness and feel especially stiff attacking kerbs and humps. Additionally, I’ve found I’ve needed to be even more delicate on the throttle coming out of corners than in previous years, though they also sometimes seem a little more prone to understeer coming into them. The upshot is a handling model that I’d hesitate to say is better than that of the old cars of F1 2021 and previous editions, but it is one that feels credibly in-line with the known characteristics of the new ones. It’s just different, and the nuances of the new cars are – at a minimum – an interesting challenge to tackle. However, while some noticeable changes have been injected into the handling, the real meat of F1 22 – the excellent My Team mode first introduced in F1 2020 – remains mostly the same. Campaign through GPs, complete R&amp;D, juggle finances; if you’ve played F1 2020 or F1 2021 you’ll know what to expect. There are a couple of nice amendments, though, like the new choice to start your first year of My Team as a richly-backed operation with pre-upgraded facilities and a fat enough bank balance to lure a 45-year-old Mark Webber out of his comfortable retirement. The F1 series has always been one of the few racers that can make scrapping for a position down the order thrilling, but having the ability to tussle with the top teams straight away makes a lot of sense for returning players who’ve steered their F1 teams from minnows to megastars multiple times already. Sponsorship decals no longer disappearing off your car despite re-signing existing partners is nice too; it’s a small fix, but it was always annoying having to manually put them back on mid-season, even after rolling over their contracts.  With its typically deep and rich career mode and its usual class-leading spectrum of assists and difficulty options, F1 22 maintains this series’ run as the most fully-featured and accessible reproduction of a single modern motorsport on the market – and long-awaited tweaks to some of its most reused elements haven’t gone unnoticed, either. It’s not quite as bold as F1 2021, though, and the footwear-and-furniture-focussed F1 Life mode really isn’t a patch to cover the lack of last year’s ambitious story mode. "
135,Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course ,9.0,"Despite what the title suggests, Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course is much more than just a fancy flan or fruit tart to top off the gourmet meal that was the original game. This is an expansion that certainly favors quality over quantity, consisting primarily of only six mainline boss fights, but they’re six incredible boss fights that each stand tall as some of the most fun, challenging, and visually jaw-dropping ones yet. Sweetening the pot are several new weapons, new charms that each add subtle new approaches to fighting bosses, some tantalizing secrets with worthwhile reward, and a brand new character in Ms. Chalice, who comes with several skills that take some of the edge off of Cuphead’s intense difficulty without outright feeling like an “easy mode.”. My first playthrough was over in just a few hours, but they were hours I’d deem essential for any Cuphead fan. The Delicious Last Course is all about making Ms. Chalice, a character who appeared in the main game only as a super-move-granting spirit, a real living and breathing cup person. To that end, Cuphead and his pal Mugman head towards a brand new isle where they’re told that Chef Saltbaker, the greatest chef in the land, is able to create a Wondertart that can permanently grant Ms. Chalice a body. The catch, of course, is that they must collect its ingredients by defeating the powerful foes that are guarding them. The story obviously isn’t the reason anyone is here, but it’s nonetheless charmingly told with quick cutscenes and more of the outstanding art that fans have come to expect.  Thus the stage is set for another round of some of the most spectacular 2D action-platformer bosses I’ve ever faced. The content of The Delicious Last Course is accessible nearly right from the start of a new game, just after you clear the first mausoleum and meet Ms. Chalice for the first time – but if you’re new or rusty, you’ll definitely want to get your feet wet with some other foes first as the six bosses in this DLC do not pull their punches.The very first one has you contending with projectiles in the air, spikes on the ground that force you to keep moving, shifting platforms that put you in danger if they raise you up at the wrong time, little gnomes that emerge from the floor to shoot more projectiles at you, and more gnomes that appear on the platforms and will hammer you if you stay on for too long. And that’s just the first phase. While the mechanical difficulty of the bosses in The Delicious Last Course are cranked up, Studio MDHR is not without mercy. There’s of course still an easier difficulty, but there are also a number of new charms and weapons that help tip the scales back in your favor, including the one that lets you play as Ms. Chalice herself. When you play as Ms. Chalice, you’re unable to equip any other charms, but she comes naturally equipped with a double jump, a dodge that she can use while on the ground to roll through obstacles, a dashing parry that makes it much easier to parry objects coming straight at you, and most crucially, four HP instead of the standard three. Some may look at that and think “oh, so it’s essentially an extra easy mode,” but that’s not quite right. Ms. Chalice also has a much worse single jump than Cuphead, so she has to use her double jump in order to get over certain obstacles that Cuphead would easily be able to clear; her dash parry is great for objects coming straight towards her, but is harder to use than the traditional double jump parry in some situations; and she’s unable to equip any of the other powerful charms that are available – like my new personal favorite, the heart ring, which rewards you with HP on your first, third, and sixth parries, essentially giving you the ability to double your HP if you can successfully parry a boss’s attacks. Another powerful one is the Coffee charm, which passively refills your super meter alongside all of the normal ways to build it, meaning you get access to your super moves far more regularly. As for the new weapons, I'm a big fan of the homing weapon called the Crackshot, which can be fired without worrying too much about aiming and has a special EX move that drops a turret, which can then be parried and launched into an enemy for big damage. Another great new addition is the Converge shot, which fires three full-screen projectiles in a wide spread, and that spread can be constricted by holding down the aim button. It’s a great weapon for quickly clearing out small weak enemies that get spawned by a boss, making it a perfect pairing for my usual go-to weapon, the Charge shot. To get the coins needed to afford these new weapons and charms, The Delicious Last Course introduces a replacement for the run-and-gun levels of the main game in the form of a series of mini bosses led by the King of Games. Early on in the DLC, you’ll be able to climb a ladder to reach the King of Games’ castle (which is a totally awesome hand-sculpted stop motion model, by the way), and from there you’re free to challenge his champions. The catch is that each of these chess piece themed mini-boss fights aren’t won with your weapons or charms – they’re won entirely with your parry technique. One fight requires you to parry all of the tops of an army of pawns, while another requires you to blow out a bunch of candles in order to make the boss damageable with a parry. They’re all clever fights, and tackling them is a fun change of pace and a unique challenge, especially when you try the gauntlet mode and attempt to beat them all in a single life. More than anything though, it’s certainly a step up over the run-and-gun levels when it comes to earning the currency needed to purchase new equipment.  Everything else in The Delicious Last Course is what you’d expect from Cuphead, but taken to an even greater degree. Studio MDHR’s Maja Moldenhauer has stated that the animation frame count in this DLC alone is comparable to the entire core game, which sounded crazy to even think about before playing – but now that I have, it’s not a hard thing to believe. Every phase of every boss in The Delicious Last Course totally transforms the battle. You’ll go from fighting an ice magician to a diabolical refrigerator to a deranged snowflake all over the course of one fight, with each phase having anywhere from three to seven unique attacks, and each attack being so absurdly packed with detail that I didn't even notice most of the smaller bits until I recorded and watched back my footage. That includes things like the way those gnomes climb up the side of the mountain and scootch under the fur, the way the background subtly changes during every phase of the fight against Sheriff Winchester, or the way the aforementioned deranged snowflake literally wrings its own body to pop out its eye for one of its attacks. The magic of Cuphead’s boss design, and something that all of the bosses in this DLC exemplify, is that while it throws a ton of stuff at you, everything is generally pretty easy to avoid if you know it's coming. Every attack is exceptionally well telegraphed, patterns are easily recognizable, and the visual language is always simple and clear. So even if I was expected to do something that’s not normally very intuitive, like parrying a pink bell to close the mouth of a cow skull floating in acid in order to create a platform, it’s something that I can quickly pick up on because I had already been taught to parry pink objects before now. The Delicious Last Course skillfully nails that hard to hit balance of being tough but fair, and saves the truly difficult stuff for expert mode, which provides a very worthwhile challenge for hardcore fans once the main campaign is completed. And for those that want even more of a challenge, well there’s something for you too, but I wouldn’t want to spoil what it is or how to get it. Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course is the perfect send off for a game that embodies the phrase “one of a kind.” Experienced players will likely muscle their way through the six bosses and optional King of Games minibosses in just a handful of hours, but the quality of those hours far outweighs their quantity. All of the bosses, including the King of Games minibosses, are among the best in the whole game, and  that’s saying a lot when you consider how high the bar was already set. I’m not normally one for dessert, but if you dine on Cuphead, you don’t want to miss The Delicious Last Course. "
136,Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak ,7.0,"Alright, let’s do this one more time: you are a hunter, and monsters are threatening your adorable little town. You’re given a quest list full of creatures to track down and turn into funny hats, and you’ll do just that until the townsfolk are safe, your build is optimized, and your outfit is as fly as your wirebugs. If you played Monster Hunter World’s Iceborne expansion, or pretty much any of Monster Hunter’s major re-releases before it, then Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is going to be a very familiar Palamute ride through the park. It’s a formulaic DLC full of exciting new foes and a couple cool new locales – and even though it doesn’t really have a ton of interesting surprises of its own, the quality of those additions reinforces just how fun that formula can be. Sunbreak is essentially structured like a brand new game, introducing the functionally identical hub town of Elgado to operate out of and a fresh storyline to follow there. That story is, once again, a largely ignorable and entirely predictable tale about how something is making the local monsters all hot and bothered, this time set in the European-themed Kingdom rather than the Japanese-inspired Kamura. Its characters are at least slightly more interesting this time around, but plot has never been the draw of Monster Hunter and that certainly doesn’t change here.  ""Monster Hunter Rise mixes classic Monster Hunter ideas with some of World’s best improvements and a whole bunch of clever new mechanics of its own. Not all of them are slam dunks, but they are all fun – and the introduction of Wirebugs and the mobility they bring to every fight is so great I never want to give them up. As has become a time-honored tradition, the expansion immediately makes all of your gear irrelevant by introducing Master Rank: a higher tier of hunts full of more difficult versions of the base game’s monsters, as well as an assortment of new and returning monsters to take on. That’s not a complaint, though, as it is legitimately fun to have the bar reset so drastically, with plenty of powerful armor pieces and weapon upgrades to gleefully chase all over again. And while it’s by no means a new trick in Monster Hunter’s bag, one of Master Rank’s greatest strengths has always been that it gives monsters altered behaviors and fresh moves to make them a renewed challenge without just raising their stats. Both the brand new monsters and the ones returning from previous Monster Hunter games continue Rise’s trend of being as stellar to look at as they are to fight. A new trio referred to as the “Three Lords” are all particularly great: Garangolm’s rocky ape-like appearance disguises its explosive mobility and surprising elemental effects; Lunagaron puts a fun twist on a traditional werewolf theme; and Malzeno’s vampire-inspired moveset genuinely shocked me the first time I saw it blink around the battlefield. Older returning foes like Astalos and Gore Magala fit right in as well, looking better than ever while providing an excitingly fresh challenge for anyone who hasn’t had a chance to face them before. As for where you’ll do that, Sunbreak adds two new locales: the Jungle, a tropical island originally introduced in Monster Hunter 2 that has been masterfully reimagined thanks to Rise’s seamless 3D maps, and the Citadel, a delightfully eclectic space that can stretch a single hunt from poisoned swamps to snowy peaks to a huge ruined castle. While I liked the Citadel more thematically, the Jungle’s condensed layout makes it Rise’s most convenient map to hunt on yet. It feels as if it learned the valuable lesson that collecting Spiribirds for a stat boost at the start of each quest shouldn’t be such a hassle, giving you a huge patch of them just a Wirebug-ride away from your starting tent. But both locales are quite entertaining to explore in their own ways, packed with even more little secrets waiting to be found. Speaking of fixing some of the mistakes of Rise, Rampages have been given the boot to an almost comical degree. The Rampage weapon tree is practically the only one that doesn’t get extended with new upgrade options, Rampage quests don’t seem to have been updated in any way, and new weapons scrap the Rampage Skill system entirely in favor of a decoration slot only fillable with special Rampage decorations (which have no connection beyond the name). It’s a stunning reversal, though not an entirely surprising one given how dull the repetitive nature of Rampage quests eventually became. While I’m not shedding any tears over the abandonment of Rampages, it also stands out that nothing has been introduced to take their place. I was glad Capcom decided to experiment with a new quest type like that, even if its appeal ultimately didn’t last, and the fact that a central feature of Rise has been gutted rather than improved in Sunbreak leaves this expansion feeling far thinner. That’s especially true compared to Iceborne, which introduced clever new ideas of its own to World, most notably the Guiding Lands as an interesting take on its endgame. In contrast, later on Sunbreak just ramps up monster difficulty with a small but amusing twist I can’t spoil – and while that’s certainly kept me happily playing, it doesn’t inspire the same sort of newfound excitement. To be clear, there is plenty to do in Sunbreak. After 45+ hours I still have gear I want to chase and optional tasks to complete, but there just aren’t that many fresh ideas to help it stand out as a whole lot more than a bunch of cool new monsters to fight. To that end, nearly every mainline quest sticks to the standard hunt format, with nothing like World’s colossal Zorah Magdaros fights, Iceborne’s Seliana defense against Velkhana, or even Rise’s admittedly one-note Rampages to at least try and shake things up. Again, every single quest I went on was still a ton of fun, but Sunbreak can start feeling pretty familiar by the end. The one place it does do something truly interesting is in its Follower quests. As you progress up Master Rank, townsfolk in both Elgado and Kamura will ask to accompany you on specific single-player quests as AI-controlled hunters. Doing their quests will unlock those people as options in Support Survey quests (also limited to single-player) where you can pick two as your party members. The hunts themselves aren’t exactly challenging or unique, but the AI is surprisingly sophisticated, using items, mounting monsters, and even placing traps before standing behind them and emoting for you to come and wait with them. It’s not as robust as a whole single-player campaign or anything, with Follower quests still initially unlocked through multiplayer story progress, but it does make grinding for specific monster parts on your own a lot more fun. The followers you bring along will banter amusingly with each other during a quest, and it was nice to get to know these characters better by actually going out into the field and hunting with them. Followers are so well implemented, in fact, that it’s a bit disappointing you can’t use them to fill empty seats in multiplayer quests as well. It seems like a pointless restriction, especially when a follower can sometimes accompany you into a handful of specific multiplayer Urgent quests. Apart from the big additions, Sunbreak brings a slew of quality of life improvements. One notably smart tweak to the way you pick your pre-hunt meals lets you alter the effectiveness of each dango ability by changing on the order you select them, adding some neat decision-making to the process. You can now quickly swap between two loadouts of Switch Skills in the middle of a hunt too, massively expanding your potential moveset. Similarly, buddies can be customized more than ever, letting you change out special moves to build the ultimate Palico without having to rely as much on finding your ideal randomized cat. There’s nothing earth-shattering in all these updates, but it’s great that pretty much every system has been touched in some welcome way.  Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is a relatively simple expansion, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t a whole lot of fun. The new and returning monsters and locales are all top notch and the renewed grind is one I’m excited to spend lots more time in. That said, Sunbreak isn’t nearly as substantial or surprising as Iceborne was for Monster Hunter World, lacking fresh ideas beyond clever AI followers that are restricted to single-player hunts, and even abandoning Rampage quests without really trying to fill the gap their absence has left. Flying through the air on Rise’s wirebugs is still an absolute blast though and anyone who enjoyed the base game will definitely enjoy the shot in the arm Sunbreak’s creative monsters provide, even if you may eventually start to feel like you’re hunting through a familiar jungle in more ways than one. "
137,Outriders Worldslayer ,7.0,"Ever since Outriders released early last year, I’ve held a theory that it's the ultimate fast food game: a bland story filled with cheesy one-liners and mindless encounters that you know aren’t good for you, but undeniably awesome combat that’s easy for you and your friends to lose hours in just makes it so dang tasty. In that context, if the base game was a Big Mac, then the latest expansion, Worldslayer, is that one sandwich from KFC where the bread is replaced by fried chicken. With a fine-tuned combat sandbox, expanded build-crafting options, and a drastically upgraded endgame, Worldslayer improves upon a lot of what was already great about the original, but it also doubles down on many of its shortcomings. That includes another weak story, annoying boss fights, and an overall lack of stuff to do. The result is a fleeting evolution of its space–magic mayhem, but one that’s still entertaining enough to leave me feeling good about making a return trip to Enoch. Like the vanilla campaign, Worldslayer’s borderline incoherent story takes place on an alien world where you play as a magical soldier called an Outrider, complete with a stupid sci-fi haircut and some of the cringiest dialogue in all the cosmos. The same mysterious anomaly that gave your character powers now threatens to destroy the entire planet, plus there’s a new scary lady that wants to kill everyone, and yadda yadda yadda – now you’ve gotta murder thousands of people and animals in the name of all that’s good.  ""Outriders offers some genuinely great sci-fi action, alongside some really interesting world and creature design that I'd love to see more of. Its mostly satisfying take on RPG loot progression is well worth putting up with a lackluster story, a few clunky interfaces, and some lingering technical issues. Outriders is the good kind of grind - especially if you're into goo-ifying your enemies with a couple of friends.It isn’t exactly high art, and the morbid curiosity that kept me following along meant I frequently found myself to be the one holdout in my group who didn’t vote to skip most cutscenes. That said, the story does actually answer some key questions I had after the main game and, crucially, addresses the ECA/Insurgency civil war that was left unresolved in the base campaign. It’s just unfortunate that a sci-fi world with this much potential is bogged down by bad dialogue and vague cutscenes that feel like they’re rushing through the beats to minimize the amount of time spent not killing things. After roughly seven short hours that’s mostly mindlessly killing waves upon waves of enemies, you’ll wrap up the core Worldslayer campaign in a pretty disappointing fashion. Having defeated enemies you hardly had a chance to meet, made new allies that speak mostly in cryptic riddles, and saved bland characters from an early death, you’ll walk off into whatever the Enoch equivalent of a sunset is to advance towards the equally indecipherable endgame story. But while the plot falls comically short of pushing you toward the action, the satisfying-as-heck combat picks up the slack in a big way. Whether you’re pulling off insane DPS as the ninja-like Trickster or Hulk-smashing groups of enemies as the unstoppable Devastator, turning whole groups of enemies into bright red giblets hits all the right notes. Automatic shotguns tear through and dismember people at short range, submachine guns apply nonstop pressure on waves of enemies, sniper rifles allow you to cover your friends from afar, and running and gunning with a crew just feels so darn good – not to mention all the wonderfully over-the-top space magic you can use. While all of that was true with the base Outriders package, Worldslayer significantly improves the sandbox with more weapons and armor, and importantly, Apocalypse items that grant an additional mod slot which opens up a whole bunch of new possibilities. Now you’ve got a potential for 50% more ways to grab new perks that synergize with your build on every slot of your inventory, and that allows for some insane stunts. In my Trickster build, I managed to equip a full set of mods that made me a nightmare against large groups of enemies, where damaging one poor soul meant damaging everyone in the vicinity. In another build, I made all my equipment either apply freeze or increase damage against frozen enemies, which left the baddies hilariously helpless against me. The one major exception to the otherwise excellent combat is that, as was true with the base game, fighting bosses is usually not a good time at all. Where Outriders generally makes you feel like a complete badass, boss fights pit you against an enemy with a health bar a mile long that you’ve gotta shoot at for several centuries before they finally die. Meanwhile you’re spinning your wheels spamming abilities and killing adds while you wait for the bad guy to eventually drop dead. It just goes on for so long and makes you feel like a complete wimp in the process – plus it’s got that classic game problem where the boss only has a few voice lines they repeatedly scream at you the whole time, and that gets old really fast. On top of the new weapon and armor options are some endgame progression systems like Pax Points, which are used in an advanced skill tree that lets you pick five new, uber-powerful perks, and Ascension Points, a slow-burning progression system that reminds me of Diablo 3’s Paragon system and allows you to make small, incremental improvements the longer you play. These systems not only give you plenty of reasons to continue beyond the first campaign playthrough, but also offer some serious game-changer abilities. For example, one standout power caused critical hits with weapons to make my Anomaly powers more deadly, while using Anomaly powers made my weapons do significantly more damage. Working my build around these abilities made my character feel more powerful than I’ve ever felt in Outriders, which is no small task. These new progression systems give you the perfect opportunity to put them to the ultimate test in Worldslayer’s endgame, which centers around a dungeon-delving activity called The Trial of Tarya Gratar. This challenging activity is a dungeon in three acts, with an aforementioned bullet sponge of a boss to fight at the end of each act and some smaller battles along the way. There are also branching paths that give you multiple ways to get through it and even offer some optional encounters that can be tackled to target-farm certain pieces of equipment – a godsend for those really looking to grind this endgame. The actual content in The Trial isn’t terribly different from what you get during the regular Worldslayer campaign, with waves of enemies to defeat and loot to claim along the way, although it’s much more difficult than everything else and can be scaled to your level to be near-limitlessly daunting. If you were hoping for a procedurally-generated dungeon that’s different each time you enter though, you’ll be sad to learn that The Trial is essentially the same every run, with only your chosen path leading you to different encounters. That’s a bit disappointing in terms of replayability, but the good news is the encounters baked into it are some of the best in Outriders so far. My favorite encounter is the second boss fight, which features a floating monster that isn’t a complete bullet sponge and instead requires you to deactivate his invulnerability shield before he can be damaged. Taking on waves of adds while quickly performing a ritual to make the boss damageable before he begins casting deadly spells is an absolute thrill, and it made me annoyed that every other boss fight just amounted to staying alive for a very long time while you slowly whittle down their health. Hopefully they’ll do more boss fights like that one in the future, because it makes all the others look downright awful by comparison. Another interesting part of the post-campaign content is that it continues the (still bad) story, which was an unexpected but welcome surprise since plenty of similar games don’t even bother trying to tie a story into the endgame – including the base Outriders campaign. Unfortunately, without going into spoilers, the main issue with all this new story content is that your character has almost no role in it. You aren’t really the protagonist, and as a result you feel like a bystander in a story that’s happening around you, or in many cases you’re getting history lessons on stuff that’s already happened that has little to no impact on what you’re doing moment-to-moment. This all culminates in the expansion’s anticlimactic final plot points during the endgame, where the  twists seem to have very little bearing on anything. It’s great that they’re trying to weave the story into the grind – I just wish that story was better than what we got. Outriders Worldslayer is an enjoyable but unambitious expansion that improves the endgame while falling short in many of the same areas as the base game before it. The story is still pretty lackluster, most boss fights are irritating slogs, and even with the added endgame grind there isn’t a ton of content to chew on, but most of what’s been added is at least a ton of fun. The improved options with Pax Points, Ascension Points, and Apocalypse items are a stat-obsessed player’s dream and had me tweaking my build for maximum devastation, and the Trial of Tarya Gratar endgame dungeon is challenging and memorable if also a bit repetitive. Still, getting another chance to run amok on Enoch was time well spent. "
138,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge ,8.0,"Growing up as a child of the 90s, whenever I stepped into an arcade, I’d always do a walk around to see what they had before putting my quarters into any machines. This usually didn’t last very long because as soon as I saw a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cabinet, I’d shout to my friends “They got Turtles!” and we’d rush on over. It’s abundantly clear that the developers at Tribute Games share a similar love for the 90s TMNT beat-em-ups. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge is nothing but unwaveringly reverent to the classic 1989 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Arcade game, and more prominently, 1991’s Turtles in Time. Best of all, it transforms the arcadey quarter-munching design of combat into something much more skill forward while still maintaining the same button mashy appeal. Put simply, Shredder’s Revenge is a prime example of how to breathe new life into a classic arcade beat-em-up.  Shredder’s Revenge is full of all sorts of winks and nods to the arcade games that inspired it, but it smartly doesn’t chain itself to them. Arcade beat-em-ups were originally designed to suck as many quarters as they could from the pockets of players, and thus have inherited a tendency to limit your ability to get out of the way of attacks or ramp up the difficulty without also ramping up your own power. Shredder’s Revenge changes all of that, as the turtles and friends can now freely dodge roll left and right; they can hold the attack button down to charge up attacks, which also has the added bonus of letting them take damage without flinching; they each have a Shoryuken-like rising attack that makes hitting aerial enemies a breeze; and most importantly, they each have a meter that allows them to use a screen clearing super attack when it’s full. The meter fills by landing hits and resets when you take damage, but the kicker is that if you’re able to fill it up completely, the super charge is stored until you use it. This adds a nice extra incentive to play smart and be vigilant about avoiding damage, because those super moves are clutch, especially in the later stages when enemies start to get tankier and more aggressive.  Aside from those additions, this is still very much the same type of game that fans of the old arcade cabinets know and love. It’s simple beat-em-up action at its finest – with a big focus on crowd clearing AOE attacks, power ups, and environmental interactables that can turn the tide of a fight in your favor. There are a total of 16 levels in Shredder's Revenge, and many of them are arranged like a remixed “Greatest Hits” of previous games. You’ve got the streets and highways of TMNT: The Arcade Game, the sewers and subways of The Manhattan Project, and the prehistoric settings of Turtles in Time. But there are also a handful of levels that are wholly original, including one that takes place at a zoo and had me contending with regular stampedes, Foot ninjas, and aggravating little monkeys in cages that threw bananas at both me and my enemies. The levels are all charming in their own right, with plenty of easter eggs and gags throughout, though I do wish there was a little more variety in the mix. There are only two types of levels: traditional stages where you just move from left to right, beating up all the baddies in your way, and high speed hoverboard stages where you move from left to right, beating up all the baddies in your way, only faster and on a hoverboard. Tribute Games plays it safe with its level design, and the result is a very even experience, but also one that started to feel quite samey by the end. Each of the levels are brought to life thanks to an impeccable soundtrack. It’s high energy, completely fits the 90s nostalgia vibe, and features a eclectic mix of remixes of familiar songs from the original games alongside entirely new songs that are equally catchy. That includes tracks from big names like Ghostface Killa and Mega Ran, a rap about the Turtles “rollin’ on broadway” in the level “Mutants Over Broadway,” and even a super cheesy rock song that feels like it’d be right at home in a Sonic Adventure game. It’s honestly one of my favorite soundtracks of the year so far. Of course, a lot of the appeal of Shredder's Revenge is playing as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles themselves, and Tribute Games has done a wonderful job of making each character feel distinct and true to their personality while still having essentially the same set of moves. Obviously they each have their own attack animations with their own unique weapons, but it’s the little things that really go a long way. That could be the way Mikey runs like a goofball, Raph’s permanent scowl and intimidating grimace, or Donny’s amusing taunt where he pulls out a gameboy. There are some notable gameplay differences between them as well: Leo’s the only character with a flipping summersault attack out of his double jump, Michelangelo can bounce off enemies with his divekick, Raph can german suplex his opponents, and Donny can hit from a football field away thanks to the reach of his staff. The Turtles aren’t the only playable characters either. Splinter and April O’Neil also join in on the action, with Splinter using his claws, martial arts, and walking stick, and April fighting with TV cameras, microphones, and array of punches and kicks. All together, there are six characters playable right from the start, and Shredder’s Revenge even allows for up to six people to play simultaneously. I haven’t done that yet myself, but even playing with just three players is absolute chaos in the best kind of way. Tribute Games does a great job of appropriately scaling the difficulty with more players by both adding more enemies and upping their aggression with each new player that joins in. There’s also a handful of fun team up attacks that are a little difficult to coordinate, but feel great when you manage to pull them off, such as the ability for one player to dive kick into another, who can catch them and throw them like a projectile to deal big damage to anything in your path. There are only two modes of play in Shredder’s Revenge: A campaign mode that lets you select levels from an overworld, and an arcade mode that gives you that classic experience of taking on the whole game from the start with a limited number of lives and continues, with no checkpoints and no saving your progress. The whole game can be completed in about two hours, so arcade mode isn't as daunting of a task as it might initially seem, and it ultimately ended up being my preferred way to play after beating the campaign once. Those who are completionists might find themselves preferring campaign mode, however, as it features hidden collectibles, a variety of challenges to complete per level, and persistent progression per character with new stats and abilities unlocked every time you level up. Arcade mode simply gives you all these abilities from the outset.  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge is exactly what it looks like: A lovingly crafted reimagining of the TMNT arcade beat-em-ups from one of the best beat-em-up developers in the business today. It’s the perfect game to have in the library for when a group of friends come over and you want to play something that’s simple, fun, and can be comfortably finished in a single sitting. It does admittedly play it pretty safe with its level design, and as a result there is some tedium that creeps in towards the tail end of the campaign or a single sitting arcade mode run, but these shortcomings are for the most smoothed over thanks to fun combat, a charming and nostalgic pixel aesthetic, and one of the best soundtracks of the year so far. "
139,The Quarry ,7.0,"Like many of developer Supermassive’s previous games, The Quarry is clearly made both by and for people who love horror movies. From the start, it slowly builds tension and atmosphere, getting you invested by constantly asking you to make small decisions that will guide its teenage cast of potential murder victims. By the time the blood started flying, every choice felt like one more step in a rolling disaster, and that made it nearly impossible to put down. When I went back to replay it again, however, it was impossible to ignore just how non-interactive much of The Quarry actually is. As a spiritual sequel to Until Dawn, it's a better movie, but a worse game. You follow the story of nine camp counselors who get stuck in the woods for one more night at the end of the summer, with nothing to do but throw one last party before they go back to their lives. There's something stalking them from the treeline (because of course there is) and your choices determine which, if any, of the counselors will be able to survive the night. This setup layers three fairly textbook horror plots on top of each other as you progress, but you can tell that Supermassive Games had a lot of fun figuring out how to connect them together. When you play, you may think you're in one type of horror movie, but you're often in another.   The title location of The Quarry is a summer camp in upstate New York, Hackett's Quarry, that's slowly falling apart. It's initially designed to look like the most postcard-worthy version of itself, backlit by warm sunlight and spread out across approximately a billion acres of natural splendor. It’s a Hollywood version of the perfect summer experience, with colorful cinematography that makes the whole camp look like somebody’s cherished memory. Then the sun goes down, the woods get dangerously quiet, the rot gets more obvious, and the nightmare starts. You play as each of the nine camp counselors, controlling one at a time at various points in the roughly 10-hour campaign. You can influence how its events play out through exploration scenes, conversation choices, quick time events, stealth, simple combat, and Mass Effect-style interruptions where you have a short window in which to make a sudden move. There are a lot of accessibility options built into The Quarry that let you adjust the difficulty of all of these actions, or even switch some of them to always automatically succeed. There's also a Movie Mode that lets the story play out without any interactivity at all, headed towards one of a few different preset conclusions. While you'll see most of what there is to see in Movie Mode, you will miss a couple of major events, many optional ones, and a lot of story context that can only come from playing manually. While I was never personally interested in using Movie Mode, I can appreciate that it exists. Even without it, you don't have to have solid twitch reflexes to get through The Quarry in the way you did with parts of Until Dawn. In fact, there are several scenes where failing something like a quick time event doesn't necessarily have a bad outcome, which makes them more like snap decisions rather than mechanical challenges. The primary issue with The Quarry is that it’s less of a game and more of a lightly interactive movie for most of its running time. You can go for surprisingly long stretches without having to make a meaningful choice or take direct control of a character. All you're asked to do is watch. In general, my favorite part of Until Dawn, as well as the games in Supermassive’s Dark Pictures Anthology, was that it was at least as much of a mystery as it was a horror movie. During the adventure game-style exploration sequences, you had the chance to try and find crucial details about what was happening by discovering clues, reading files, solving puzzles, and occasionally falling into what was, with the benefit of hindsight, a really obvious trap. There isn’t anywhere near as much of that in The Quarry. You do have the chance to unravel some of the weird history behind the camp and the area around it, but it feels like an afterthought that left me disappointed. Another issue is that you can't skip past cutscenes or dialogue that you've already seen on repeat playthroughs. In Until Dawn, that was a mild headache; in The Quarry, which is longer and considerably less interactive, it's frustrating. I’d like to replay The Quarry more than I have. There’s a lot of fun in going back through it and deliberately making different decisions, or even failing on purpose just to see what happens. I was still finding surprises on my third run, and it’s a testament to how absorbing this setting and story can actually be that I was willing to make that third run in the first place. It would be a more entertaining process with a few important quality-of-life features that are missing. A better scene selector would be nice, as well as a run button, a fast-forward option, or better-labeled points of no return. As it is, any attempt to replay The Quarry involves actual hours of dead time, where all you can do is sit and watch it play itself out again. The Quarry is deliberately meant to have a lighter tone than Supermassive's other horror games, in a way that its director compared to Scream, which is backed up by the casting of David Arquette as Hackett’s Quarry’s way-too-into-this-whole-thing head counselor. It's very self-aware right from the start, with a cast of characters who have all seen at least one horror movie before and are acting accordingly. At the same time, The Quarry's storyline feels like Supermassive's learned a lot from its past projects and is putting that experience to work. It feels more confident, with a more solid, coherent plot structure. There are still plenty of twists, but they’re carefully calculated, and a few actually managed to take me by surprise. The Quarry's Death Rewind feature, which is unlocked after your first clear or offered as a bonus for buying the deluxe edition, gives you three ""lives"" over the course of a single run. Each one lets you redo the most crucial decision that would've otherwise led to a playable character's death. However, that does mean you can be jumping very far back, as some characters' fates were sealed by choices that you made hours ago, and you'll have to replay the entire game from that point forward. Supermassive tells us it is looking into improving this so that people aren’t unexpectedly flung back so far, but it’s not entirely clear what that fix would look like or when it would arrive. In the meantime, Death Rewind is great if you just blew a QTE, but not if a major story decision didn't go the way you wanted. The cast of motion-captured actors are a particular highlight. A couple of them do still get relatively little to do, and I'd hoped to see more of Lance Hendriksen’s creepy backwoods hunter, but most of the characters are genuinely likable and you're given plenty of time to get to know them. Ariel Winter, Siobhan Williams, and Justice Smith as Abigail, Laura, and Ryan, respectively, are all particular standouts, and Brenda Song as Kaitlyn somehow manages to end up as the biggest badass in the cast. The characters in The Quarry don't actually act as if they're in a horror movie, however. Many of them are operating on a level of ironic detachment that occasionally verges on self-parody, especially if you're on a run where the body count is still fairly low. I've run into multiple sequences where my current characters were still talking earnestly about their petty relationship drama despite being covered in someone else’s blood. No scene is dramatic enough that it can't be derailed by a half-joke, and no amount of recent personal horror is enough to keep someone from landing the perfect sick burn. It doesn't come off as awareness of their medium as much as outright traumatic dissociation. In horror terms, if Supermassive Games was aiming for Scream, it overshot and ended up with The Cabin in the Woods. The Quarry is worth playing at least once, but when compared to Until Dawn, it's one step forward and one step back. It features a solid script performed by a great cast, with a slow-burn story that you can guide to a few different satisfying (or anticlimactic) conclusions. It's not as interactive as I'd like it to be, though, and that makes replaying it as intended a chore. It's still a fun experience, particularly on your first time through it, but Supermassive Games' formula could use some quality-of-life improvements. "
140,Mario Strikers: Battle League ,8.0,"Look, I enjoy the realism and attention to detail of a FIFA game as much as the next person, but sometimes you just want to swallow the soccer ball, pop it out as an egg, and then bounce that egg downfield until it hatches and wizzes past the goalie. That’s just one of the incredibly silly moments that only the Mario Strikers series can provide, and Mario Strikers: Battle League is no exception. Trying to outmaneuver your friends and score a goal while engaging in a distressing amount of cartoon violence with no referee in sight had me howling with laughter one second and snarling in anger the next, and you can’t ask for much more than that. Although it’s been 15 years since Nintendo gave us the last Mario Strikers and shockingly little has been changed since then, that over-the-top mayhem and competitive intensity is a formula that holds up remarkably well.   Mario's twisted version of soccer has two teams of four compete to kick, throw, headbutt, or butt-stomp a soccer ball into the rival team’s net in a highly chaotic fashion that only bears the faintest resemblance to the real-world sport that inspired it. The premise is simple to pick up and learn in a matter of seconds, but what’s impressive is how complex it can get as your skill and desire to win grows. Perfecting your power shots, learning to time your dodges, and figuring out how to best make use of on-field item pickups are all ways to make you a master out on the pitch. After a few hours of practice, it begins to feel similar to a well-tuned fighting game, where every action has a natural counter to it and each match becomes a test of your reflexes and ability to read your opponents’ intentions. That level of balance and depth is pleasantly surprising for what looks like a minigame you might find in Mario Party at first glance. A good example of that balance is in the ability to tackle enemy players to the ground at any time, immobilizing them for several seconds. That can feel pretty toxic if you’re playing against an especially rude team, and you might even be subjected to the completely awful experience of being repeatedly tackled even when the ball isn’t in your possession. But this scenario has a clever counter-measure: tackling someone who isn’t in the immediate vicinity of the ball grants that team a free item to be used immediately. So if the enemy is playing especially dirty, they’re also arming you with stuff like a bob-omb that can be lobbed back at them or an invincibility star that can give you free reign of the field for several seconds.  In order to become a Battle League champion, you’ll need to learn the ins and outs of both those basic soccer techniques like passing, shooting, tackling, and handling the ball, as well as the ridiculous stuff like items and making use of your character’s special abilities and stats. While throwing a turtle shell at someone’s face brings no end of joy, the fundamentals still play a hugely important role in actually getting the ball in the net. For example, learning dodge at just the right moment grants you a short speed boost afterward, whereas getting the timing perfect when charging up your tackles or shots at the goalie makes them more effective – both of which can be extremely helpful in breaking through your opponents’ defenses. The characters you’ve chosen for your team are also an important factor in what you’ll be able to do in the heat of this fight of feet. If you’re playing as Toad, for example, you’ll be extremely fast but will also need to charge up all of your tackles if you want any hope of being able to take the ball away from someone beefy like Bowser. If you play as Donkey Kong on the other hand, you’ll be a face-slapping machine but also much slower. If a character doesn’t feel exactly the way you want them to, you can even buy gear with the coins you’ve earned from playing to augment their stats to be better in the areas you care about at the cost of being worse in others. Being able to tweak my Mario into a goalie’s worst nightmare with a maxed out Technique stat to curve my shots around them was extremely satisfying, and giving my Toad a full loadout of strength-enhancing gear so he could easily tackle some of the chunkiest enemies was enormously amusing. Plus, the gear actually changes each character visually, and dressing Rosalina up like she’s straight out of Tron just looks cool.  The other major difference between characters is their Hyper Strike: a unique ultimate ability that lets you execute an absolutely ridiculous move to score points. These can be activated after picking up a floating orb that spawns on the pitch and include everything from Wario smashing the ball with his stinky butt to Rosalina literally kicking it into outer space until it comes crashing back down to the field – utter insanity. One of my favorites is Peach’s, who uses her charm to simply make the enemy fall in love with her so the goalie just voluntarily tosses the ball into his own net. Activating one of these moves requires clearing the field of enemy defenders so you can charge up your ability and play a short quicktime event to execute the move, but the risk involved is well worth it. Not only do you get to see a dope cutscene play out, but successfully pulling one off grants your team two points. This is all a lot of fun, but very little of Battle League strays far at all from what we’ve seen in the series before. Not only are all the central mechanics nearly identical to its predecessors on the Gamecube and Wii, but there are also fewer characters than in the past (just 10 total) which seems like an odd move. There’s no story mode or campaign of any kind either, and no game types aside from the standard one you play across every mode. It’s a pretty bare bones package all-in-all, even if that package is extremely replayable.  The main offline mode is called Cup Battles, where you enter your team in a routine and extremely brief tournament against computer-controlled opponents with a trophy up for grabs if you can best the enemy. These tournaments are a great way to learn the ropes and build up your skills before playing with friends or in matches online, but they offer few surprises and only minor differences between each of the cups you can enter into – usually just different AI teams that use slightly tweaked strategies and items from each other. The good news is that some of the later cups offer a greatly increased difficulty for those looking for an increased challenge against the AI, but I wish there was more diversity in what each of the tournaments offer. Outside of the AI modes, it's pretty impressive that Battle League supports eight players on a single Switch, which makes it the perfect party game. It’s hard to beat the friendship-testing onslaught of dividing a room full of people against one another in a sport so immediately confrontational. That said, it’s a little disappointing that you can only play as one of the four runners on each team while the goalies are always computer-controlled, especially since those goalies are sometimes grossly incompetent and wildly inconsistent in their skill level from moment-to-moment. It would have been nice to let me assign that job to a real human I know I can trust, or can at least direct my rage at.  But the biggest improvements Battle League makes over past entries is in its online multiplayer, which lets you join or manage a Strikers Club where you and your friends can compete against other clubs in a ranked playlist and claim seasonal rewards for reaching different divisions. Compared to the very limited online functionality available in the Wii-era Strikers, the leap forward in supporting a competitive landscape is a massively unexpected delight. In my pre-release time with Battle League, I only briefly got to try out this mode, but so far it seems to have a surprising amount of bells and whistles to sustain a sweaty community of tryhards, which I fully intend to count myself among. My one gripe is that you can only join online matches with two players playing locally on the same Switch, which means you can’t take a full in-person hangout online without multiple systems.  Mario Strikers: Battle League is part skillful soccer game, part ruthless brawler, and almost always a complete blast to play. If you’ve played any games in the series before, there won’t be many surprises in store for you and the small roster of characters and game modes is definitely disappointing, but what’s there is incredibly fun and replayable. I’m impressed by the online mode in the time I’ve had with it so far too, as it sets the stage for a ranked playlist that I look forward to grinding my way to the top of. "
141,Diablo Immortal Review in Progress,6.0,"Killing monsters just never gets old in the Diablo games. The feel-it-in-your-bones punch and kinetic energy of combat has always been one of the series’ strongest attributes, and Diablo Immortal proudly continues that tradition on iOS and Android devices (and PC, though that version isn’t available at the time of this writing). It also looks set to continue the tradition of near-neverending gameplay, in which the meaty campaign is just a starting point, giving way to dungeons to run, higher-difficulty levels to ascend, and endgame systems in which to take part. My verdict on whether it succeeds on all those fronts will be some time coming, however, as the early access review version I’ve spent the last week playing was really only a taster. After all, it’s hard to judge a game with MMO aspirations amongst an extremely limited pool of players and an impending progression wipe ahead of launch. Even so, after playing a Demon Hunter (one of six classes at launch) up to level 50, Diablo Immortal has done a great job of scratching my demon-slaying itch. So stay a while and listen to my thoughts so far.  Somewhat to my surprise, I’m a big fan of the touch controls. What Diablo Immortal’s virtual buttons lack in tactility they make up for in versatility, with the ability to easily move your character and aim skills separately, twin stick shooter-style. It’s certainly not as pixel-perfect as using a mouse and keyboard, but suits the initial PVE gameplay really well, where the macro strategy is more important than the micro. The flow of combat for my Demon Hunter was all about utilising a combination of AOE, targeted damage, crowd control and evasive moves, and juggling the cooldowns and recharges on each. With the primary attack and assigned skills, plus health potions, all within easy reach via the touch interface, it was simple to dominate most combat encounters on normal difficulty. Another nice inclusion is that the primary attack auto-targets, meaning I can back away or strafe while still holding the attack button. Immortal also supports controllers, and it feels good this way, with the right thumbstick used for aiming alongside the shoulder buttons for skills. Navigating menus is a little clunkier with a controller as you might expect, though, so overall the touch controls are seamless enough that they are currently my preferred control method -- particularly on iPad, where the screen is large enough that having my thumbs on the sides isn’t much of an issue. Mouse and keyboard is also supported on the PC but I didn’t have access to that version ahead of launch, so haven’t tested this yet. This is going to sound contradictory, but while character progression in Diablo Immortal is more multifaceted than any previous game in the series, I’ve never actually spent less time in my inventory in a Diablo game. Immortal boils down every item’s power level to a single number, making it a gratifyingly simple matter to equip stronger items and get back to the killing. Longer-term you may want to pay more attention to what’s dropping, particularly when you have a specific build you’re aiming for, but in the early going this streamlined system puts the focus on the action, which I like. Salvaging unwanted gear has a very direct benefit in Immortal, too, as the scrap materials and enchanted dust you get is used to rank up your items, strengthening their core attributes, as well as adding random bonus attributes at certain levels. And you never lose that rank, because you can simply transfer it across when you swap a new item in. This system means that not only is all loot useful, no matter how apparently useless, but alongside levelling up and gem socketing, it feels like I’m always making progress on my character. Speaking of gem socketing, Diablo Immortal has a major twist on that age-old idea. In addition to regular – Diablo II-style – gems for secondary items like rings and boots, Immortal introduces legendary gems, which can be attached to your character’s six primary items and can also be ranked up. These can have some pretty strong effects, such as summoning shadow clones, inflicting agony on critical hits and preventing fatal damage. There are more than 30, opening up all sorts of options to hone in even further on a specific build. Legendary items themselves come with an “inscription” that modifies a single skill, sometimes drastically. Smoke Screen, for instance, may go from being a defensive manoeuvre to letting you toss grenades. Discovering a new inscription is meant to encourage you to shift up your combat strategy, but in practice so far, I’ve actually found that it can feel like more of a restriction, as I want to stick with any strong inscriptions, even if I unlock a new skill that could serve a similar purpose. After all, why wouldn’t I stick with Strafe for my AOE attack if I have an inscription that boosts its damage and another one that extends its channel time? That said, I do like the ability to extract inscriptions and imbue them to stronger items of the same type. As for how all these character-progression and itemisation systems tie into endgame gameplay, and also into monetisation, remains to be seen. Not only were all microtransactions disabled on the version I’ve been playing, 20 hours of gameplay is really only enough to scratch the surface. Similarly, I’ve only had a small sample of what the boss fights might be like once the difficulty cranks up, but there are some encouraging signs. Some bosses have bullet hell-like projectile attacks to evade, others transform or multiply. As you’d expect, many of these foes tower over the player, but the clear signposting ensures you can see attacks coming. It will also be interesting to see how the Immortals vs Shadows conceit plays out, too. The basic idea is that one group of players on a server hold power as Immortals, and the Shadows -- a much larger group that’s broken up into subguilds called Dark Clans -- attempt to gain enough momentum to overthrow them. There are numerous activities to compete in and perks to earn as part of this system, but again, with so few players in the early access period I was only able to dip a toe in. That said, the early access period has been a valuable opportunity to see what the free-to-play experience is like. The good news is that not once, in more than 20 hours, did I hit any kind of unexpected roadblock where it felt like I was expected to make a purchase to more easily push through. Of course, in a modern Diablo, working through the campaign on normal difficulty isn’t meant to be hard, it’s meant to be fun and empowering; an excuse to show off your character’s badass abilities and enjoy the rhythm of combat before you’re tested in the fires of the harder difficulties. Even so, it’s great that Immortal’s business model doesn’t mess with that, and in fact, it nails the sense of progression -- the regular level dings, the steady evolution of gear, and the ever-expanding set of skills to use. And by the time I was getting a good feel for a zone I’d be whisked to the next one. Well, for the most part. The first 10 hours set a breakneck pace, but after that I generally needed to grind to hit the recommended level once I’d unlocked a new zone. I didn’t mind that too much, as Immortal gives you plenty of different options to earn XP, from taking on bounties and contracts, through to running short standalone gauntlets like Challenge Rifts (which steadily increase in difficulty) and Elder Rifts, which keep things interesting through randomised gameplay modifiers that can be both positive and negative. Even just roaming the world can be worthwhile due to the random events that pop up regularly, while Hidden Lairs can be discovered and conquered. The key thing here is that there’s no need to put any money in to make steady, rewarding progress in the campaign, and that’s a fantastic sign. Immortal feels great to play, and for the most part it looks pretty good, too. The character and monster models don’t stand up to close scrutiny all that well, but from the typical gameplay vantage point the art direction is strong enough to make up for low-poly models and a lack of texture detail. Immortal is very much driven by mood and atmosphere, and in that respect it’s captivating, transporting us from fetid swamps and foreboding woods, through moody caves and blood-smeared dungeons, and on to picturesque peaks. The impressively wide array of beasts, demons, cultists, soldiers, undead and so on also look great in motion, even if they’re largely cannon fodder for my explosive bolts. Diablo Immortal’s presentation is a little mixed in other places too. I absolutely love the detailed, often severe portrait thumbnails during dialogue, but the voice acting tends towards the overblown at times. The storytelling also often feels like a means to an end - a vehicle for missions that are quite obviously just an excuse to send us on fetch and kill quests. Even so, Diablo II fans will dig that this game takes place after Lord of Destruction, with shards of the shattered Worldstone causing havoc all over Sanctuary, and a number of familiar characters pop up, like Charsi, Akara, and Flavie. Also Deckard Cain. Always Deckard Cain. I also appreciate how smoothly the main quest line incorporates the many dungeons and there is a good sense of momentum throughout. On a technical level, I encountered numerous issues with the pre-launch build, from bugged map, skill, and dungeon screens, through to missing audio in cutscenes and dialogue, and even the odd crash. I’m sure a fair number of these will be resolved by launch, but I’ll be surprised if we don’t see at least a few issues in the early days. I’ve only just started on my Diablo Immortal journey, but I like what I’ve played so far. The combat feels potent and weighty, with plenty of skill options for building out rounded and fun combat approaches. The story moves along at a brisk pace, opening up new zones steadily, while the many character progression systems ensured that I felt like I was always making progress and growing more powerful. And with more than 20 hours of microtransaction-free gameplay behind me, there’s clearly a lot of content to enjoy before you need to consider spending money, so this is very much a game you can try before you buy. Of course, it’s too early to say whether that’s too good to be true for the endgame as well, which is why I’m not yet comfortable slapping down a provisional score here. That kind of thing can cast a dark pall over even a great game. Stay tuned for my full review in the coming weeks after launch on June 2. There’s so much to like about Diablo Immortal that it really pains me to see it so close and yet so far from being a game I can heartily recommend. As a casual, purely free-to-play experience it offers a lot to do, with its empowering ARPG combat and interesting skill system, whereas for those that want to be competitive in PVP it quickly becomes restrictive, punitive, and money-grubbing. And for everyone in between? It just doesn’t offer good value for money spent. If the Empowered Battle Pass and Boon of Plenty offered more, I could definitely see myself renewing them each season and steadily working my way through the many difficulty levels as I ascend Immortal’s 600 paragon levels, and gradually – oh so gradually – ranking up my legendary gems. Instead, that dream is so far out of reach that it’s not feasible, and the further in I get the less the rewards offered by those paid services are actually likely to be meaningful. I’m still going to keep playing Diablo Immortal, but without overhauls to the monetisation and the many restrictions, it’s going to be a dip in, dip out game, as opposed to a world I want to live in. "
142,Kao the Kangaroo ,7.0,"Kao the Kangaroo reminded me why I fell in love with 3D platformers back in the N64 days.  While I missed the Dreamcast console-exclusive original back in the day, it surprised me how familiar this reboot of the 22-year-old series felt, though the revived Kao doesn’t exactly try hiding how it’s looked to other modern platformers to create a highly derivative comfort-food experience. It’s a lot of fun, colorful, and certainly rather nostalgic; just don’t come in expecting a Crash Bandicoot 4-level challenge. Stories of heroes rescuing loved ones against the odds is nothing new in this genre, so suffice it to say that Kao’s not breaking from tradition here.  Dialogue could’ve been stronger, too; there’s good humor to it, but that’s sometimes weakened by outdated pop-culture references. Kao’s mom referencing “taking an arrow to the knee” is hardly topical, and the younger crowd a game like this is aimed at probably won’t recognise it. Still, there’s a pleasant cast joining our young hero like his wise teacher, Walt, whose more grounded nature keeps scenes entertaining by acting as an effective straight man for Kao.  Now, this wouldn’t be much of a mascot platformer without wildly varied environments, and Kao packs four visually appealing worlds. Between the uncomfortably warm Lava Caves hiding within the sunny Hopalloo Island, Hungry Jungle’s tropical sights, and the (hopefully) self-explanatory Frozen Mountains, they’re fun to explore even if they fall into the usual tropes. Each location serves as a hub that’s filled with collectibles, though runes are the only batch you actually need to concern yourself with, since they unlock new levels. Once you begin exploring, Kao quickly finds his father’s old boxing gloves, which absurdly happen to be home to a strange and sassy entity who provides him with supernatural abilities. Alongside your standard jabs and combo strikes, Kao can build up to powerful finishers by hitting multiple enemies. These gloves also store up to three elemental charges, starting with fire before unlocking ice and electricity. They provide some nice visual flair to his finishers but, more importantly, also help him clear platforming obstacles like spider webs  or freeze water to create a bridge. Otherwise, Kao’s dodge-roll also attacks enemies, making it a blessing for defensive strategy, with an understandable trade-off in that these don’t hit nearly as hard as a straight punch. Kao's packing some strong moves and the new developer, Tate, has given us plenty to do with them by providing us with decent enemy variety. We’ve got the usual grunts taking swipes at you up close, but things like goats firing sheep at you with a launcher keep this interesting. Every world’s capped off with a boss fight, each of whom provide some fresh tricks -- I won’t spoil them all, but Hopalloo Island’s boss, Terror, leaves a trail of fire behind him after attacking, while Hungry Jungle’s Jayabaya lobs projectiles from afar that Kao can punch straight back. Nothing groundbreaking, sure, but enough to avoid predictability. Between climbing across vines using his ears, grappling across floating hooks, and making temporary platforms appear once you’ve struck a purple crystal, levels carefully and effectively avoid repetition. There’s the odd bit of puzzle solving too, including one challenge where Kao must link the lines together on a crystal to make it whole, clearing your path upon completion. Another level had me running away from an enemy rolling towards Kao on a giant log, taking clear inspiration from Crash Bandicoot’s Boulder Dash. Again, nothing entirely original, but traditional ideas are sampled and remixed effectively enough. You’ll find no end of hidden secrets, so I’d recommend thorough exploration. Are there secrets behind those waterfalls? You bet! Levels hide plenty of collectibles: between extra lives, heart pieces, treasure chests packed with coins, and diamonds, there’s plenty to grab, and cash can buy new costumes from each hub world’s shop. That includes a retro look for Kao, which will likely please original fans. Every level also hides three letters spelling KAO, which can be tricky to find, and some enemies drop scrolls that unlock fresh lore for the ‘Kaopedia.’ If you’re not feeling it for another platformer collectathon, fear not. Like I said before, only runes are essential for progression and nothing else is mandatory. But it does beg the question; why are some of these even here? The letters can be tricky to find, much like it was in Donkey Kong Country, so I understand there’s a sense of accomplishment in finding them. But across my entire playthrough, I couldn’t find any practical use for these collectible diamonds. That includes during the post-game, which takes you back to before the creative final fight, letting you complete things you missed. Thankfully, items aren’t the only secrets found during exploration. There are 14 mini bonus levels, known as Eternal Wells, hidden within these stages, and each requires you to complete a set challenge. That can be something simple, like defeating several waves of enemies, though more commonly it involves completing trickier platforming challenges, earning more coins, or collecting more diamonds. Each hub world contains a separate Well, so if you find one but struggle to complete it you can still go back at any time, there’s no need to dive into the main levels and find it again. That said, even after beating those wells, Kao is a quick experience that needed just nine hours to complete, taking 20 mins on average per level. If you’re not fussed about exploration or the Eternal Wells and are simply here to see this campaign through, you’d probably manage it in about seven or eight hours. In fairness, though, not many platformers are longer than that; big-name games like Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart and Super Mario Odyssey are one thing, but smaller efforts like A Hat in Time or Ary and the Secret of Seasons clock in at similar lengths. I’m just glad Kao doesn’t overstay his welcome -- it felt like the right length, and Tate’s balanced this well. The main problem was that I just didn’t find it particularly tough, and there’s no difficulty settings to crank this up to challenge me on a second playthrough. It’s not a complete cakewalk, (that dodge roll comes in handy when confronted by enemy groups), but those extra lives scattered everywhere quickly stack up. Death came infrequently, even more so once I began finding heart pieces to increase Kao’s health. I didn’t mind this so much, though. I won’t pretend this structure doesn’t feel formulaic after four worlds, yet Kao nails the basics. Kao the Kangaroo does an excellent job making me nostalgic for an old-school 3D platforming series I’d never played. It doesn’t try too hard to be gimmicky, packing a colourful aesthetic and light-hearted humor to carry it through the parts where it feels unoriginal. You probably won’t find it particularly challenging outside of a few tougher platforming segments -- combat’s rather easy, and some may find the collectathon premise off-putting. Still, I never found it dull and Tate’s done a fine job reviving this obscure mascot, even if you can spot Kao’s many modern influences from a mile off. If all you’re after is a comfy platformer that’s not particularly demanding, you’ll find an excellent choice here. "
143,Sniper Elite 5 ,7.0,"In news that will make any Nazi with a nutsack feel nervous, the serial scrotum-sniping soldier, Karl Fairburne, is back on the hunt. Sniper Elite 5 shifts the series’ established blend of espionage and X-rayed executions to 1944 France, taking Fairburne deep behind enemy lines into another collection of surprisingly large-scale stealth sandboxes. Yet while welcome enhancements to controls, weapon customisation, and multiplayer features make Sniper Elite 5 by far and away the most flexible entry in the series to date, another forgettable story and some heavily recycled mission objectives made it seem more like sniper repeat than sniper elite by the time I reached the end of its 12-hour campaign. The Sniper Elite series has always been more concerned with tracing the trajectory of its bullets than creating complex story arcs for its characters, and indeed this fifth mainline instalment is no different. This time around Fairburne is on a quest to uncover and thwart the Nazis’ top-secret Operation Kraken, assisted by yet another ragtag group of resistance fighters who exist simply to act woodenly and populate your list of objectives at the start of each mission. Drop in a cartoonish high-ranking Nazi antagonist and a series of predictable late-game dramatic turns, and you have a WWII story more straightforward than the scope on Fairburne's carbine.  Thankfully, while Sniper Elite 5's storyline might be staid, Fairburne himself has never been more nimble or as adventurous, making him more fun to control. While each stalk through a heavily guarded area inevitably starts out as a silent crouch-walk, the moment things go loud you are now capable of quickly mantling over low walls and through windows, gaining some distance with a zipline, clambering up vines and rope netting, or sliding down inclines to break the line of sight and regroup for a counterattack. While occasionally I found myself with my back to the wall and no other option than to shoot my way out, for the most part the open level design allowed me to be less of a sitting duck and something more closely resembling a sniping Spider-Man. Sniper Elite 5’s eight different environments take good advantage of Fairburne’s expanded movement set, offering multiple entry points to each facility be they through the front door, around the side, or through some hard-to-reach open window on an upper floor, and I enjoyed the added freedom to execute each infiltration from almost any angle of my choosing. You also have a new focus ability that allows you to spot enemies through walls in order to avoid a potential ambush, and tools like bolt cutters can cut through weakened sections of fences to create even more optional paths to an objective. While you are now able to shimmy up to sniping spots that would have previously been unreachable, the actual experience of sniping remains largely unchanged from Sniper Elite 4. You can still tag your targets with binoculars, tamper with generators to mask the sounds of your shots, and take advantage of environmental hazards like explosive barrels in order to force these fascists into a fiery finish. Plus, the X-ray killcam is more disturbingly detailed than ever, filling Sniper Elite 5 with more ugly headshots than a struggling actor’s glovebox. It’s certainly still a formula that regularly provides some grisly good fun, but it also feels fairly familiar to my experience with Sniper Elite 4 -- right down to the occasionally wonky AI which at times seemed about as crudely realised as a toilet stall swastika no matter how much I increased the combat difficulty setting. I like the fact that enemy soldiers will often sprint desperately for the nearest alarm tower to radio for help once you’ve engaged them in combat, resulting in a gripping burst of tension as you scramble to take them out before they can call in reinforcements. It’s also a neat touch that if you wing them they’ll sometimes run away clutching at their wound. But while they can certainly be deadly in numbers, they will also often march mindlessly into your crosshairs, struggle with basic pathfinding, or veer unpredictably between different states of alertness. In one late-game mission set in an expanse of French countryside, I was spotted killing a couple of German soldiers and an alarm was raised forcing me to flee. Yet when I returned to the area some 20 minutes later, the enemy patrol remained locked in a cycle in which they’d be in a heightened investigative state, then the investigation would end, then the same dead body would be noticed and the investigation would begin again as though they were a group of goose-stepping goldfish. On the plus side, while the AI may presently have quirks in need of some post-release patching, I did at least find the auto-save system to be far more intelligent than that of Sniper Elite 4, and anytime I died I was grateful that it always returned me to a checkpoint that didn’t place me directly back in mortal danger, as was regularly the case with the previous game. Another welcome change is the return of weapon customisation, which was noticeably absent from Sniper Elite 4. All of your firearms can be tweaked either prior to a mission’s start or at workbenches hidden in each map, and although I didn’t agonise too much over the builds of my pistol and SMG, I certainly enjoyed the challenge of experimenting with the anatomy of my rifle in order to get the balance right between maintaining its power while minimising its audible range. Meanwhile, Sniper Elite 5’s skill upgrades are doled out in a far less stingy manner than the previous game, and I appreciated the fact that I didn’t have to grind in order to unlock perks like the ability to use a medkit in a last-ditch effort to revive myself, which became invaluable in the campaign’s tougher final hours. While Sniper Elite 5’s weapon and skill upgrades allowed me to tailor Fairburne to my specific style of play (including the option to carry multiple ammunition types like subsonic, armour piercing and even non-lethal rounds) the one thing that surprised me about its weapon system was its approach to found weapons. Weapons dropped by enemies or found in hidden caches can be picked up and used, but they’re dropped again the minute you switch to another firearm in your loadout. On the one hand it meant I never accidentally discarded a valued tool in my arsenal, but it also meant that occasionally I’d grab a panzerfaust in order to go and murder an armoured car, only to have to keep dropping it and picking it up again each time I switched to my pistol to deal with any ground troops along the way. It seemed like a needlessly fiddly way to transport a weapon that could have just been slung around Fairburne’s shoulders. Sniper Elite 5 plays host to some truly sprawling sandboxes that are each intriguing to explore, from the manicured surroundings and opulent insides of the Chateau de Berengar mansion, to the towering cathedral atop a heavily fortified spy academy, down to the bowels of the menacingly molten production areas of a Nazi war factory. Despite the non-stop murdering and inherently heavy WWII themes, there are certainly some entertainingly lighthearted surprises to stumble across along the way, and I particularly enjoyed pausing to observe a group of Nazi spies struggling to learn how to speak like Americans -- before I crept up to assassinate their instructor. That said, I was disappointed to find how many of the espionage-based objectives tended to be recycled from one mission to the next. I lost count of how many times I had to plant satchel charges on AA guns, or snap tethered cables in order to topple a radio tower, or turn the exact same set of pressure valves in order to shut down a variety of different production centres. It became increasingly underwhelming when each impressively rendered Nazi facility I carefully snuck my way through ultimately culminated in a similar style of humdrum handiwork, and it diminished my desire to complete all of Sniper Elite 5’s side missions once I learned how samey they all seemed.  The Hitman-like unique assassinations that can be found in each stage prove to be far more memorable, albeit occasionally for accidental reasons. Dropping a heavy chandelier on top of a high-profile Nazi target provided the nice bit of Looney Tunes-style fun the developers intended, but I was somewhat taken aback when I planted some poison in another target’s drink, and after he took a sip he glitched out and seemed to melt into the floor like he was the Wicked Witch of the West. Still, I enjoyed the opportunity to take out targets with my rifle holstered, and I wish there was more than one of these unique targets per map. While I wasn’t able to try the majority of Sniper Elite 5’s multiplayer modes as part of the pre-release review process, I did manage to test out both the campaign co-op and the new counter-op Axis Invasion mode. Pulling off synchronised kills in co-op is every bit as fun as it was in Sniper Elite 4, only this time you and your partner are able to operate with a bit more coordination since you can share ammo and medkits, as well as other mission-specific items like unique room keys. There’s certainly a strong argument to be made that two-player co-op is the optimal way to experience Sniper Elite 5’s campaign. I was less enthused by the prospect of trying Axis Invasion. I’ve previously disabled the similar modes in the likes of Deathloop and Elden Ring since I fundamentally object to the idea of being griefed by a stranger while I’m trying to make the most of my limited evening game time, and thus I toggled the feature off while I was completing Sniper Elite 5’s campaign. However, upon rolling credits I returned to the opening mission to try it out, both as the invader and the invaded, and I was pleasantly surprised -- particularly at the novelty of playing on the Nazi’s side and being able to move freely among the other SS troops as I hunted down the other player’s Fairburne. The invading sniper doesn’t have binoculars like the other player, but can instead tell other AI enemies to ‘look sharp’ in order to momentarily heighten their awareness. The sheer scale of Sniper Elite 5’s maps can make it tricky at times to track down your target, and it would be handy if you were able to grab a lift in one of the transport trucks that constantly roam around many of the maps rather than go everywhere on foot, but based on the small taste I’ve had so far I’m certainly keen to experiment further with the mode after launch. Despite its numerous tweaks Sniper Elite 5 ultimately feels like more of an incremental upgrade than a major revolution, keeping it a half-pace ahead of Sniper Elite 4 rather than taking a big goose-step forward for the series. With a more manoeuvrable main star, modifiable weapons, enhanced co-op, and Axis Invasion allowing the hunter to become the hunted, Sniper Elite 5 is still a satisfying and spectacularly gross way to shoot Nazis in their nether regions -- but it feels like the series needs to start aiming its sights a little higher and find ways to avoid repeating the same handful of objectives so often. "
144,Evil Dead: The Game ,8.0,"As far as the movies go, The Evil Dead series has a track record of being way better than it has any right to be, low-budget warts and all – and Evil Dead: The Game now finds itself squarely in that same boat. While it’s filled with things that irritate me, like slight inclines that my wimpy survivor was helpless to scale, finicky command prompts, and more, it also overwhelmingly succeeds at being a balanced, compelling battle of wits and reflexes that has kept my attention after more than 20 hours – and that’s no small task. Aside from the clunkiness, playing as a survivor absolutely nails the horror movie feel of working with a group to overcome an overwhelming evil threat, while playing as the menacing demon is a diabolically fun misadventure that fulfills the villainous mastermind fantasy.   Yes, Evil Dead: The Game is an asymmetrical multiplayer game in the same vein of the likes of Dead by Daylight and Friday the 13th, but here it’s presented with a goofy, Bruce Campbell-smothered flair that’s every bit as weird and campy as the cult-classic movies. Mechanically, there’s not much original about it: each match, four playable survivors work as a team to avoid being maimed long enough to perform a ritual that banishes all evil from the land, all while enduring the true horror that is the map’s geometry. At the same time, one evil player does everything they can to kill the survivors using an army of undead soldiers and a bag of dastardly tricks so wickedly satisfying it’s hard to feel bad for the poor souls succumbing to your terrible power. That game of cat and mouse is an absolute blast no matter what side you’re on, even when its rough edges make me scream louder than any jump scare. It is somewhat distinct from its genre peers in that the humans are capable of defending themselves. Playing as a survivor feels like a familiar, squad-based, third-person shooter that borrows a lot from the battle royale style in which you’re running around as a squad looking for loot and killing enemies as you steadily power up. Only here, your goal isn’t just survival, but completing objectives like finding map pieces and defending areas to claim relics needed in the purification ritual. With plenty of melee and ranged weapons to find and 13 characters to choose from, each with their own unique abilities and skill trees to be leveled up, its progression system got its hooks into me early with all the different ways things can play out. For example, the Hunter class characters excel at using ranged weapons and have abilities that make them a major thorn in the side of the demon player, like one particularly awesome character that can exorcise the demon from bodies they’ve possessed. Alternatively, you might want to play as a Leader class character like the hilarious Lord Arthur, an old-timey knight who swings a sword around and can buff the team with effects that make them more lethal in combat. The worst part about playing as a survivor, though, is that you’re far more prone to experience some of Evil Dead’s signature clunkiness when moving around the map. There’s no jump button to be found and environments are often uneven, meaning you’ll find yourself stuck on a tiny rock or other minor obstruction all the time – including the worst possible times, such as when a demon is trying to rip your face off. Sometimes a prompt will allow you to climb over small obstacles, but more often than not you’ll have to walk all the way around even something as trivial as a low hedge wall. The demon, meanwhile, can fly over all of that, making the glitches as asymmetrical as the gameplay design. Aside from being locked in a life-or-death battle with small pebbles, you’ll also struggle with the lack of a lock-on system when fighting undead mobs, finicky interaction prompts to do things like light a campfire or revive a fallen teammate that often doesn’t register during crucial moments, your character getting frozen in place for several seconds for no foreseeable reason, and more. Probably my biggest pet peeve though, is the really obnoxious safe zone system, which restricts your squad to an increasingly confined area as the end of the match approaches. If you’ve played a battle royale game before you’ll be familiar with the concept, but Evil Dead implements it in the worst possible way by making the safe zone changes unpredictable, almost instantly lethal if you’re caught outside the boundaries, and incredibly inconsistent. I’ve had entire matches mucked up as my team completed an objective, only for the safe zone to jump over to another part of the map a few seconds later, catching half the team in an unavoidable death zone and ending any hope of claiming victory. That’s just downright frustrating. Luckily, the experience as one of the three playable demons has fewer sticking points, mostly because you play as a floating orb of evil that can quickly hover across the map and mess with the survivors with godlike powers, and that’s an objective that never stops being amusing. That’s due in large part to how many ways Evil Dead lets you accomplish that devious goal: you can summon hordes of computer-controlled enemies for the survivors to fight, set traps that spawn enemies and increase their fear when sprung, or even possess undead characters to control them directly, making them even stronger and more difficult to deal with. Not only that, but by scaring the human team using traps or demonic abilities, and by separating them from one another, you gain the ability to possess the survivors themselves for a limited time, turning them against their own allies, which can be absolutely devastating. Another amusing way to win is by simply wasting the survivors’ time by doing things like possessing the car they’re driving and steering it off a cliff so they have to spend valuable time wandering around on foot, or by possessing a tree and swatting humans in the face while they’re trying to rest at a campfire. All the while you’re leveling up and gaining stronger and stronger demonic abilities until only the most resolute and skillful players have any hope of defeating you, and it just feels so delightfully evil. I usually prefer to be on the survivors’ side in this style of game rather than face their united attempts to kill me as the monster, but Evil Dead captured my heart almost instantly – it’s easily the best monster mode I’ve seen. Of course, once you’ve gotten a handle on both the survivor and demon modes, there isn’t a ton left to do aside from grinding for XP and leveling up your characters. And although I easily lost myself in over 25 hours of matches, the package does feel a bit light on content in some regards, especially where maps are concerned. There are only two, and although they’re both fairly large and each has a few interesting areas, after a dozen or so matches I started to see a lot of the same places over and over, and that increasingly wore down Evil Dead’s novelty the longer I played. I mean, you can only hang out at a derelict doll factory so many times before you start feeling like you’ve seen all a derelict doll factory has to offer and wish you could visit some other types of failed businesses, ya know? Evil Dead: The Game also offers some single-player missions, which are required to unlock some of the best characters, including Pablo from Ash vs. The Evil Dead or the legendary King Arthur himself, but unfortunately these missions are without a doubt the worst part of the package. While they try to serve as palette cleansers to the multiplayer-centric experience, they end up being tedious slogs through the same map areas found in multiplayer where you complete a few fetch quests, fight a couple enemies, and receive snippets of story through still images that pop up to interrupt your playtime. Not only are they completely uninspired, but they also don’t have checkpoints – so you can die and lose 20 minutes of progress and have to do it all over again.  And because you’re playing alone as a survivor in a mode that feels like it was tacked on, the issues with polish are amplified exponentially, including the aforementioned horrible safe zones feature which ruined multiple runs by relocating safety zones to different parts of the map with no warning and instantly killed me. They even have the audacity to try stealth mechanics in one of the missions, which went about as well as you’d expect, and made me wonder if the unlockable characters were worth the torment. The good news is that there are only five missions and once you finish them you never have to do them again, but getting through them all is a pretty painful experience. Evil Dead: The Game is an awesome asymmetric multiplayer game that, like its source material, is far better than it has any right to be given its frustrating lack of polish and being somewhat light on maps and modes. Playing as a survivor is a fantastic cooperative shooter experience despite frequent problems with janky level geometry that leads to unfair deaths and other questionable design choices, while playing as the evil mastermind is just downright magnificent thanks to the amusingly fiendish ways you can mess with the other team. The single-player story missions are a distressing mess that I could have done without being forced to play through for unlocks, but everything else proves worthy of the classic cheesy movies that inspired it. "
145,We Were Here Forever ,8.0,"Since 2017, Dutch developer Total Mayhem Games has been quietly working on the We Were Here series, a trilogy of cooperative-only puzzle games that puts us in the shoes of two explorers who find themselves trapped in castles, dungeons, snowstorms, deathtraps, and all other manner of escape rooms. The whole trilogy is a little uneven, but for the most part they’re all pretty good, especially since no other developer scratches this particular asymmetrical co-op puzzle itch quite like the We Were Here series. The latest, We Were Here Forever, is – to put it quite simply – an absolute glow-up. It’s gorgeous, with fantastic art direction that takes you from the familiar castle interiors to surreal dreamscapes, a spooky abandoned village, and much, much more. There are significant barriers to overcome to get the most out of We Were Here Forever, not the least of which are having to buy two $18 copies so you can play with a like-minded friend (unfortunately it’s not as generous as Hazelight was with its co-op hits A Way Out and It Takes Two, which include a free friend pass.) But if you’re able to hook in someone who loves escape rooms and asymmetrical puzzles as much as you do, you’re both in for a co-op adventure the likes of which I’ve rarely seen.  We Were Here Forever places you and your buddy into the boots of two nameless explorers who, for untold reasons, find themselves locked inside series mainstay Castle Rock. There is an ongoing story connecting the We Were Here games together, but it’s not required knowledge to enjoy the self-contained plot of Forever, which itself is serviceable, but certainly not the reason anybody is here. It’s the puzzles that are the star of the show, and the ways that they manage to test the teamwork, observational skills, and communication of you and your partner are in a league of their own. I’d hate to even go into too much detail of individual examples or show too much of them out of fear of spoiling their solutions, but there’s a wonderful mix of navigational puzzles, where one person has to guide the other through a section using information only they have; symbol-recognition puzzles that force both of you to describe obscure symbols to each other in order to fulfill some sort of shared goal; asymmetrical races against the clock; tricky logic puzzles; and more. The list just goes on and on, with enough content that it took me and my partner around 12 hours to complete them all.  More often than not, you’re split up from your partner and have no frame of reference for what it is they’re seeing. This process of not only figuring out the useful information in your area, but then also piecing together how it interacts with what they’re seeing is just so uniquely satisfying. Every small breakthrough was something we celebrated, and when we finally got through a whole puzzle and were reunited there was genuine elation every time. It’s worth mentioning too that having a good partner is a necessity, and your mileage with We Were Here Forever may vary immensely based upon who you play it with. There is random matchmaking available, but that’s absolutely not the way to go here – I’d highly recommend playing through it with a good friend. Teamwork like this requires patience, persistence, and keen observation skills. There are also a bunch of fun opportunities to horse around, playfully troll your partner, and sometimes even do some good ol’ fashioned sabotage for a quick laugh, and those moments help add some much needed levity to a story that takes itself perhaps a bit too seriously. That’s great with a friend, but getting stuck with a bad actor partner by luck of the draw would give them a lot of opportunities to be obnoxious. The puzzles are tough – there’s no getting around that – but there’s always a logic to them, and if you really hit a wall each person can call upon  three hints per puzzle that each do a decent job of pushing you in the right direction. Even with those lifelines, though, expect to spend a good chunk of time bashing your head against the wall trying to figure out a solution. In a good way, I swear. Even the puzzles that we spent the longest amount of time trying to figure out had that “eureka” moment that made it all worth it. The world needs more games like We Were Here Forever. The cooperative-only puzzle landscape is largely untapped and full of potential, and We Were Here Forever is one of the best examples of why. Its puzzles rank up there with some of the cleverest and most satisfying I’ve seen in a video game, and its decently lengthy 10 to 12-hour campaign ensures that by the time it reaches its memorable conclusion the requirement that each person buy their own copy doesn’t feel like too much to ask. The way it requires clear communication between partners at all times means it doesn’t lend itself well to online matchmaking, so I highly recommend bringing a puzzle-loving friend along for the ride. On that note, it would’ve been an even more irresistible deal if it came with a friend pass, but all things considered, We Were Here Forever is a monumental leap forward for a series that has been quietly but consistently creating some of the best co-op experiences around. "
146,Salt and Sacrifice ,7.0,"I really wanted to love Salt and Sacrifice, and for a little while, I did. As the sequel to one of my favorite soulslikes, Salt and Sanctuary, it hit all of the buttons I had hoped it would: challenging combat, a huge variety of grotesque and intimidating enemies, fun boss fights, and an expansive world to explore. But there’s a monster-sized twist to Salt and Sacrifice’s gameplay formula: It introduces Monster Hunter-like elements, complete with repeatable boss hunts, roaming area bosses, and exhausting chases of your targets through gigantic zones. It’s a risky experiment, and one that doesn’t quite pay off. Right out of the gate, Salt and Sacrifice doesn’t initially seem all that different from its 2016 predecessor. It still has that signature gloomy and grim Ska Studios flavor, though all of the hand-drawn art and animations have been completely redone for the better; the tutorial borrows heavily from the Dark Souls school of teaching you the bare minimum, then crushing your spirit with a tutorial boss that’s technically possible to beat, but you’re not really supposed to; and combat maintains a very quick pace despite being tied to a fairly strict stamina meter that highly discourages button mashing.  These bits that Salt and Sacrifice inherits from Salt and Sanctuary are its strongest points. There’s a ton of playstyle customization thanks to a wide variety of different weapons types; combat is deep, satisfying, and impactful; the zones are fun to explore with meaningful rewards tucked away in hard-to-reach areas; there’s a refreshingly easy to initiate co-op mode; and several options for PVP as well. But the two games are actually very different on a fundamental level. Instead of having one continuous map, Salt and Sacrifice is actually split up into five zones, each of which are enormous and sprawl out in every direction, with progression through them primarily gated by doors that only open when you devour a certain amount of named Mage hearts. You do this by initiating Mage Hunts, which are Monster Hunter-esque boss fights that have you chasing down a particular Mage all throughout the map, engaging it in several small skirmishes until it eventually settles into its proper boss arena, at which point you’re locked into a traditional boss fight. It all looks fine on paper, but in practice, this blending of Monster Hunter, Metroidvania, and Soulslike is a far from perfect mix. For one, you’re never given a map. Just to reiterate, these zones are huge, often with entire sublevels that take place above ground, underground, in large castles, and in the skies. Trying to chart a path back to the boss you were fighting, the salt resource you dropped after dying, or the locked door that you’re now able to open is far more frustrating than it needs to be. Sure, Salt and Sanctuary didn’t have a map either (I also wish it did), but its absence matters less in that game because its levels are much more linear in their design. To add on to that, while there are plenty of checkpoints in the form of obelisks that act as respawn and restock stations, there’s no way to fast travel between them or even choose which one you want to start at when you first go from the main hub to a zone, which amounts to lots of retracing your steps through the same enemies, the same traps, the same platforming challenges over and over again, which gets very repetitive. Then there are the mage hunts themselves, which come with their own set of drawbacks. The final phases when you actually fight the boss in their walled-off arena are generally pretty fun. They can  feel overwhelming when you first encounter them – but after a few attempts, you start to see the openings for you to dodge, block, or attack, making them regularly land in that sweet spot of being difficult but manageable. It’s the chases that are the problem. The big issue is that you never know what else is going to be there when a Mage decides to teleport to an area. I often found myself having to contend with two Mages at once, or a Mage that just camped a ledge and made it nearly impossible for me to get to where I needed to go, or a mage that would spawn extremely tough and durable enemies in an area that was already full of extremely tough and durable enemies. Mercifully, damage persists on Mages while you’re chasing them so you don’t go back to square one when you die, but the bummer is that you have a limited amount of restorative items. On a few occasions I found myself spending 20 to 30 minutes chasing a Mage around the map, exhausting my resources to the point where I only had a few attempts before I completely drained myself of healing flasks by the time I reached the actual boss fight. I would have to quit out of the hunt, farm more flasks, and then do the whole thing over again. Salt and Sacrifice ended up taking me 25 hours to complete, and far too much of that first run was spent retracing steps, farming materials that felt like they should just replenish at a checkpoint, and battling bosses that I had already beaten three or four times before. On the plus side, at least the five levels are fun to explore. They are each very visually distinct; they all have an incredible amount of enemy variety, with few if any repeated enemies across them; there are a large handful of Mages to find and hunt; hidden treasures that are well off the beaten path are fun to find, as well as hidden NPCs that will return to the hub once you find them and offer some sort of helpful shop or multiplayer function. The good news about the Monster Hunter influence in Salt and Sacrifice is that if you’re the kind of person that welcomes the grind and doesn’t mind the extra repetition of beating the same bosses multiple times, there’s a very satisfying progression of loot that awaits you. Just like how every monster in Monster Hunter has their own specific set of craftable weapons and armor you can make from their remains, so too are there unique weapon and armor sets for every Mage you defeat. I always looked forward to going back to the hub and checking out the new weapons and armor I could craft after downing one. Most weapons gained from Mages also come with unique skills that add fun new facets to combat. My trusty half-spear that I got from killing a Chronomancer gifted me with the ability to place down a pillar that would slow down time for anything that walked within it, along with the ability to call upon spectral blades that would slice up anything in a large range above me, which proved to be incredibly useful. Using these skills did require some pivoting on the skill tree to adjust my build, but fortunately you’re given a limited number of respec points every couple of levels that allow a great amount of flexibility when it comes to customizing your character. There are also hidden tomes throughout each zone that unlock Fated Mage hunts, which are repeatable hunts that can be used to hunt specific Mages in order to collect the upgrade or crafting materials that you need. I felt like I had my fill of repeatable hunts just from the frequency that they’d spawn in world after I killed them once, but again, for those who are all about the grind to complete their armor sets, it’s nice to have the ability to revisit these hunts in a structured way. What saves Salt and Sacrifice from being a skip is its multiplayer options. While you can do the Dark Souls style of cooperation and PVP that’s tied to various in-game items and NPC factions, the real star of the show is the simple cooperation board that allows a host to enter a passcode, have their partner enter the same passcode, and boom they’re playing coop together. It’s simple, it’s easy, and it’s just such a unique experience to be able to play through a soulslike from beginning to end with a buddy without ever having to jump through any hoops. It helps too that the implementation of co-op is top notch. There are fun emotes to bring a bit of much needed levity to what’s otherwise an aggressively dark adventure, enemies are scaled to make the challenge still very prevalent even with another body, and the drawn out hunts are much less of a chore when you’re able to do it with a friend. Playing in coop turned instances that would’ve infuriated me as a single player, where I’d get bopped by an extremely hard to see trap, or juggled to death by a boss, into shared moments that I could laugh at with a friend. You could call Salt and Sanctuary a 2D mashup of Dark Souls and Castlevania, and you'd be right. But such a simple pronouncement would be a disservice to the tremendous amount of thought that's gone into Salt and Sanctuary, whether it's in the graphic style that evokes horror through the style of comic strips or in the intricate web of dungeons and castles serves as it map. To its credit, Salt and Sacrifice is a sequel that does not just rest on its laurels. It’s an ambitious endeavor that tries to combine the essence and mechanics of a 2D platformer, a Soulslike, and a Monster Hunter game all in one while also greatly expanding in scale. And while there’s promise in that premise, the execution here is imperfect. The lack of a map or a fast travel system makes navigating around the five enormous zones a big hassle; chasing down Mages in Mage Hunts quickly becomes tiresome, even despite the fact that the boss fights themselves are generally pretty good; and there’s a level of grind and repetition required that causes the campaign to drag on far longer than it needs to. Its easily accessible and straightforward cooperative play is its saving grace, as playing in co-op helps relieve some of its major pain points and elevates the experience beyond what it would normally be as a solo player. "
147,Trek to Yomi ,7.0,"If you’re a fan of classic samurai movies, there’s a lot to love about Trek to Yomi. It’s a katana-swiping side-scroller with a worthwhile story that does a magnificent job of distilling old school Japanese cinema into video game form. But while it never stopped blowing me away aesthetically, the things you’re actually doing in that beautiful world are less impressive, with overly simplistic combat and exploration that only begins to scratch its surface. Even so, Trek to Yomi’s stylish presentation makes up for many of its gameplay shortcomings, making this a memorable samurai tale I’m glad I played. Trek to Yomi’s dedication to black and white samurai movies from the 20th century is apparent in literally every moment of it, from the look of its boot-up logos and main menu all the way to the closing credits. That includes everything from the artificial sparkle dotting the screen that makes it look like it’s playing from an old film reel, to the pacing and line delivery during cutscenes, to the references to historically accurate traditions and religious practices that play a central role in the story. It’s actually hard to overstate just how great it feels to move about in such a meticulously detailed adaptation of a film style I’ve always adored, and that movie magic is the best thing Trek to Yomi has to offer without a doubt.  The story itself is your standard revenge quest featuring a stoic protagonist struggling to choose between his duty and his personal desires, complete with the good ol’ traumatic childhood massacre serving as its first chapter. It’s a cliche, to be sure, and if you’ve watched almost any vintage samurai movie then you’ll be able to see a lot of its events coming from a mile away. But with all the other ways Trek to Yomi pays homage to the classics that inspired it, an overly conventional story doesn’t end up being such a bad thing. Sometimes tropes become tropes for a good reason, and this familiar tale was like stepping into a warm bath filled with my favorite, samurai-scented candles. It isn’t entirely without its own twists and turns either, and on at least one occasion it did something I hadn’t anticipated – moments that went a long way toward redeeming the otherwise predictable plot. You’ll spend most of this adventure ronin around and slicing your way through beautiful backdrops with a combat system that’s satisfying despite not having much to it. You’ve got light attacks, heavy attacks, a parry, and a few ranged weapons thrown in for good measure, but that’s about as deep as Trek to Yomi ever goes. Every now and again you’ll unlock a new attack combo or meet a new enemy type that requires you to mix up your strategy ever so slightly, but after less than an hour I had mastered most of the skills I needed to blow through armies of bandits and spectral samurai with unbridled ease. This was especially true once I unlocked the ability to easily stun enemies and finish them off with a bloody animation that also heals you, which you can use to bail yourself out of nearly every encounter the campaign throws at you. It’s not that combat is ever bad, it’s just extremely simplistic and doesn’t evolve enough as you progress to keep things feeling fresh. It’s also very familiar to many other 2D action games, with no real hook or new idea to set itself apart from anything I haven’t already seen elsewhere. Most of the time, I found myself just enjoying the awesome sights and sounds while I barrelled through every enemy in my way (even on the hardest difficulty, mind you). It’s a good thing that the whole adventure only lasts six hours, because combat gets old in less than half that time, so at least it didn’t have much chance to overstay its welcome in a way that got frustrating. Boss fights are an exception to the breezy combat though, as they usually introduce an enemy that can’t simply be decapitated in an instant. These spongey champions must be studied so you can devise a strategy for surviving their attacks and carefully counter them. Bosses accounted for the vast majority of my deaths throughout my playthroughs, since they’re one of the only parts that forced me to mix up my strategies. Even when I was getting slapped around helplessly, it was a blast figuring out how to best these dastardly warriors, but they’re so few and far between that they just made me wish more of the combat presented a similar challenge. Trek to Yomi also dabbles in some light exploration and even a side quest or puzzle now and again, though it’s all extremely shallow stuff. Exploration usually amounts to a few samey optional rooms with a hidden collectible or an alternate path to get wherever you’re headed – sometimes you’ll even find a way to avoid a combat sequence altogether by triggering a neat environmental kill, such as dropping logs on some fools like a vengeful Ewok. It’s just too bad these ideas weren’t taken a little further as it’s currently all incredibly straightforward and opportunities for environmental kills almost never come up. Similarly, side quests usually amount to an optional area where you can slay a few extra baddies and grab some easy loot from a grateful survivor, while puzzles are little more than mind-numbingly easy chores like pushing an object or matching some symbols. As a result, these diversions all just feel like filler.  Trek to Yomi is a brief but captivating journey that’s like playing through a monochromatic Japanese movie, and that excellent presentation is enough to carry it even though it falls short in most other respects. Combat is one-note and easily mastered, and exploration and puzzles don’t have much to offer aside from a fleeting distraction. Thankfully, its relatively brief story was one that still drew me in enough to absolutely feel worth my time. "
148,ogue Legacy 2 ,9.0,"Back in 2013, the original Rogue Legacy added a revolutionary twist to the standard roguelike formula: Instead of losing everything upon death, you’re able to spend your currency on permanent upgrades that make each successive run just a little bit easier. This kickstarted an entire subgenre called roguelites, which now includes such incredible games as Hades, Returnal, Dead Cells, and many more. That’s a daunting landscape to return to nine years later, but Rogue Legacy 2 is a sequel that wisely doesn’t attempt to reinvent the wheel. Instead it successfully modernizes its look, premise, and mechanics to meet the heightened modern-day standards of the genre, and hones the design to razor sharpness. Rogue Legacy 2 feels like a reimagined version of what that first game could have been with the benefit of more time, money, and hindsight of how the genre has evolved since 2009. The basic premise is still the same and still just as strong as ever: You play as a hero with a randomized name, class, and quirky trait; explore a massive, procedurally generated castle; collect loot; and attempt to beat bosses. When you die, you lose all the progress you made on that particular run (save for defeated bosses or unlocked portals), but you’re able to spend the loot you picked up to purchase a wide variety of permanent, yet incremental upgrades that get passed down to your next of kin.  So it’s very much the same blueprint, but virtually every individual aspect of that premise has been transformed for the better. For one, each class has their own distinctive weapon, talent, passive ability, and stats, making them play incredibly differently from one another from the jump. As an example, my favorite class, the Valkyrie, is super well-rounded. She comes with a large polearm that can be used to swipe in four directions, Hollow Knight style, and also has a special talent that lets her spin her weapon and deflect small projectiles, with every bullet deflected replenishing her mana. Compare that to the Barbarian, who uses a slow but powerful axe that can only attack left or right while on the ground, but when it’s used in the air it sends him into a constant spinning attack that can do huge damage in skilled hands.  What’s especially cool about these 13 classes is that they each have a special way of reliably doing critical hit damage if you’re able to use their weapons skillfully. These are appropriately called skill crits, and for many characters, it can be as simple as just attacking while dashing towards an enemy, but for others, it could be making sure you land with the tip of your sword, or nailing the third hit of a three-hit flurry, or landing an attack right after an evasive roll, and so on. It’s not only a great way to differentiate the classes even further, but also reward those that really take the effort to learn how to effectively use each of them. While I always sprang at the chance to use the Valkyrie when they popped up in the randomized choice of three heroes at the start of every new run, I never bemoaned having to use a class that I wasn’t as familiar with. Each class presents its own pros and cons, and it was always fun to play to their strengths and attempt to work around their weaknesses. And there’s a lot of variety to that because your class isn’t the only thing that’s randomly assigned to your hero: each character also has the potential to be saddled with a random trait that can either be a blessing or a curse. These traits are usually based off of real-life conditions, so you might roll a character with colorblindness and have to play that whole life in monochrome; or a character might be prone to panic attacks, which causes the screen to darken every time they get hit; or maybe they’ll be a vegan, which causes you to take damage from eating meat as opposed to being healed by it. Many of these return from the original Rogue Legacy, but there are still plenty of new ones that add interesting new wrinkles to each run, or at the very least will probably elicit a chuckle. The first couple times you see them, traits can be fun ways to provide some variety to each run, and some are even required to find certain secrets, but eventually some of their gimmicks do start to wear thin. The most debilitating ones, like for example, the pacifism quirk which takes away your ability to deal any damage, come with incentives that can dramatically increase the amount of gold you collect while being afflicted with them, but I never found the trade-off worth the degree to which they hindered my playstyle. Thankfully, every new run of Rogue Legacy allows you to choose between three randomly rolled characters, and very rarely did I ever find myself having to pick a character that had a trait that was miserable to play with.  The expanded class system is fantastic, but what truly makes Rogue Legacy feel exponentially bigger and bolder than its predecessor is its enormous and diverse interconnected world. There are six unique locations in Rogue Legacy 2, and unlike the original’s four – which largely felt very similar outside of having different enemies, a few different room layouts, and a distinct backdrop – the areas in Rogue Legacy 2 all present unique challenges. One stretches out horizontally and requires you to island hop as you try to avoid deviously placed arrow traps and fight off enemies in very tight quarters; another takes the opposite approach and demands that you climb upwards with pinpoint-precise platforming sections. A third is like a labyrinth and has low visibility along with requiring you to use landmarks to find the general direction of the areas of interest that you must explore before you can reach the boss. Progression is gated by powerful bosses as well as special artifacts, called heirlooms, that grant permanent upgrades that add a new facet to both exploration and combat, whether that’s the ability to double jump, dash while in the air, or bounce off of special types of projectiles or hazards. Each heirloom is also preceded by a quick tutorial section that does a wonderful job of teaching you the practical applications of each new ability so you’ll never be surprised or be left confused at some of the clever tricks that are used both in platforming challenges, and in hiding various secrets. It was always exciting to get a new heirloom, not only because they almost always unlocked a new part of the map, but also because they almost always provided me with a way to avoid getting hit by certain enemy attacks. Whether by dashing through void energy, bouncing off of electricity, or just by simply having an extra dash to get out of a bad spot, the extra mobility is a huge defensive boost that helps to extend each life significantly. Heirlooms aren’t the only items of interest to find as you’re exploring Rogue Legacy 2’s exceptionally dangerous rooms. There are a large number of relics to discover, which can provide game-changing buffs, highly risky trade-offs, and sometimes both thanks to a Resolve stat that reduces your max health if you try to equip too many of them at once. You can also pick up weapons and spells outside of the one your class starts with, blueprints that can be used to purchase new gear on subsequent runs, and runes that can also be purchased and equipped to further bolster your preferred playstyle by doing things like, adding lifesteal to your attacks, giving you an extra jump or dash, or increasing the amount of damage you deal on critical hits. And this all adds up to the one thing that I love most about Rogue Legacy 2: Every run feels meaningful. Even if you don’t beat a boss, unlock an heirloom, open up a shortcut, or do something that gives you sense of significant permanent progression, chances are you found a new blueprint, collected enough gold to buy a new upgrade or two at the castle, experimented with a new character class, learned what a new trait does, found a new piece of lore, or did something that taught you a lesson about dealing with a specific type of enemy or trap. And if you didn’t do any of those things, well then… chances are it was a super-short run and you likely didn’t get too invested in that character anyway.  There are so many decisions to make when it comes to improving your character in between runs that it can get a little overwhelming, and the unfortunate reality is that it’s very possible to make bad decisions about which permanent upgrades and unlocks to spend your gold on and leave your save file in a rough spot. In part that’s because once buy 15 upgrades, every new one increases the amount of gold required to buy any subsequent upgrade. That isn’t a big deal at first, but by the time you hit level 50 or so it makes even low-level upgrades prohibitively expensive. This caused me to hit a significant roadblock in my first playthrough, because I made the poor decision of trying to spread my points around and expand my manor so I could see what all of the upgrades were. The upside was that I got to unlock and experiment with a bunch of different classes, but the downside though was that my stats were underleveled to appropriately handle the increased difficulty of later areas, and it was exceptionally difficult to survive long enough and gather enough loot to be able to upgrade those stats more than just one or two points at a time. As a result, I had to grind. My first playthrough slowed to a crawl in the last two areas, and the exciting feeling of progression that made the first half so exciting became a painfully slow IV drip. It was a mess of my own doing, but I wish there was some sort of option to reset the manor upgrades that would’ve allowed me to dig myself out of the hole I fell into. The good news for you is that now that you’ve read this, you won’t make the same mistake. One really nice addition that Rogue Legacy 2 brings to the table are a set of options called “House Rules.” These are values and sliders that can be used to customize the difficulty to your liking, whether that’s by making it easier and turning down the enemy damage or health, making it harder by cranking those values up, or more accessible by turning on things like unlimited flight, turning off damage from enemy contact, or turning on time slowdown while aiming. While I personally opted to leave these settings alone and play as the designers intended, it’s wonderful that Cellar Door Games included difficulty and accessibility settings that go beyond just the standard easy, normal, and hard levels, allowing everyone to tweak settings to their own needs. However you complete the campaign (my first run took about 16 hours) reaching the end of Rogue Legacy 2 will be just the beginning, as its post-game content is expansive. When you beat the final boss, you gain access to a new NPC that presents a list of modifiers called Burdens that are tacked on to your next playthrough and do things like increase the damage of enemies, add harder variations of certain enemies, or add an entirely new version of an existing boss fight.  At every level of New Game+, you need to add two more burdens; so at NG+1, there are two burdens; NG+2, four burdens, and so on. It’s a really smart way to keep the challenge fresh while also giving us control of the type of difficulty we’d like to face in our next run through. Rogue Legacy 2 is a transformative sequel that essentially rebuilds the extraordinarily influential 2013 original into a modern roguelite that stands nearly shoulder to shoulder with the best of the genre. Its wealth of upgrade choices to be made in between runs can be a bit overwhelming the first time through, especially without a way to undo mistakes, but that issue feels small compared to its an incredible menu of customization options, excellent combat that handsomely rewards skillful play, six diverse areas that each provide their own unique challenge, and a deep post-game mode that provides plenty of reason to come back for new challenges long after the first rolling of the credits. With Rogue Legacy 2, Cellar Door Games can now not only have a claim to developing one of the first ever Roguelites, but also one of the best. "
149,Nintendo Switch Sports ,7.0,"Remember when everyone and their grandma was caught up in the Wii Sports craze more than 15 years ago? Nintendo Switch Sports tries to recapture that lightning-in-a-bottle moment with a tighter but all too familiar experience, refining the same concept of simple, family-friendly motion-controlled games and applying it to new and old sports alike. Just like Wii Sports before it, Nintendo Switch Sports is best played as a fun but shallow party game that you can break out for friends and family in a pinch, though this time it’s not quite the novelty it was back in 2006. You can play any of Switch Sports’ six games (volleyball, badminton, bowling, soccer, chambara/sword fighting, and tennis) alone or with friends, both locally and online. They’re all generally high quality, but pale in comparison to Wii Sports Resort’s 12 (admittedly less consistent) games when taken as a full package. My first day I spent time playing each sport alone to get a feel for them, and while putting spin on a backhand return in tennis to the tune of its excellent music tracks gave me a dose of nostalgia, it wasn’t until I decided to play a few rounds with my parents that the magic of Wii Sports came back in force. There’s fun to be had in playing a quick tennis match against some NPCs or bowling a few frames alone, but Switch Sports is undeniably at its best when you’re playing in the same room with other people, waving your arms and legs around like maniacs.  Although I stood relatively still when playing a match of badminton against my mom, making the bare-minimum motions with the Joy-Con necessary to trigger on-screen movements, my mom would lunge across the room to return a shot, throw her shoulder into each smash, and ultimately ended up winded because she wasn’t playing Switch Sports like a video game: she was playing it like the real thing. Similarly, when bowling, both my parents tended to walk up to the screen every time they threw the ball because the simplicity of it made those movements feel all the more natural to them – like they were bowling a round in real life. The special sauce that Wii Sports always had to bring in frequent gamers and the uninitiated alike is absolutely still here, and it’s the simplicity of the motion controls that makes it work. But to really test out Switch Sports in its natural environment, you need a party. So I got together with a group of 12 friends and let them have at it. Beyond some of the routine headaches with connecting all the Joy-Con correctly, getting my friends up and at it was a breeze. Every single game in the collection is immediately more fun in this setting – chambara becomes a series of wild flails while onlookers cheer on, badminton emerges as an intense back and forth with neither player willing to accept defeat, and soccer turns into a mad sprint to the ball to try and get some last-second diving headers in before the clock hits zero. Some of the individual games fare better than others when it comes to the intuitiveness of the controls – specifically, volleyball is the most difficult sport to simply pick up and play. During any given match you’ll be automatically shuffled through all the different positions, from server to setter to blocker. Your success is almost entirely based on cooperation with your teammate, because well-timed sets, jumps, and spikes compound into stronger, harder-to-return shots. Once everyone gets the hang of these motions it’s a lot of fun and made us feel like we were working as a team, but getting to that point wasn’t nearly as instinctive as the other games. Badminton is easily my favorite sport of the bunch. It offers the most control, rewarding underhand returns, smashes, birdie placement, and more fine-tuned executions. You can even hold the trigger to initiate a drop shot, forcing your opponent to rush the net so you can then satisfyingly smash the birdie to the opposite corner of the court. It’s limited to two players at a time, but the often-heated returns feel much more intense for it. Badminton is also the only sport in the collection that made me notice the Joy-Con’s HD Rumble – precise haptic feedback that I could feel in my hand whenever the racquet connected with the birdie to make a satisfying *ting* sensation. Bowling also gives you a high degree of control over the ball, and I was quickly bowling 150-point games without breaking a sweat. But the real challenge is in the Special mode, which throws increasingly difficult obstacles in the path of your strike and will give even the best Wii bowlers a run for their money. It also gives you and up to three friends the option to play simultaneously, so everyone doesn’t have to sit around and wait for each person to finish a frame – the result is chaotic and fittingly fun. Unfortunately, the 100-pin bowling mode from Wii Sports Resort is nowhere to be found. Soccer is the most disappointing: it plays like a slower, less flashy version of Rocket League. The ball is larger than the players, and you spend most of the time in a match slowly running across the field. 1-on-1 was generally more enjoyable simply by virtue of the field being smaller, while 4-on-4 takes forever with the ball constantly trading possession. Soccer also bafflingly only allows for up to two human players at a time, preventing it from being redeemed as a fun party game. The physical edition of Nintendo Switch Sports comes packed with a leg strap, the same one included with Ring Fit Adventure. Because of that addition it costs $50, whereas the digital version only runs you $40 if you go without – frankly, as things stand, I recommend that you buy digital. The only use for the leg strap currently in Switch Sports is a shallow soccer shootout game that feels more like a hamfisted gimmick than anything else. Though Nintendo says it will update Switch Sports this summer to allow you to use the leg strap in the full soccer game, its effectiveness in this limited mode makes me doubt that it would be worth the higher price in the end. Chambara’s sword fighting produces the most intense bouts of the lineup. Both fighters enter a sort of stilted dance, where one blocks while the other attempts to pull off parallel slashes to cut through their defenses. If you’ve chosen to use the Charge Sword, more successful blocks result in a powerful and satisfying return strike, while Twin Sword wielders can swing their weapons in unison to execute a Zelda-like spin attack that makes their generally more awkward handling worth it. Though the motion controls don’t always feel perfectly accurate, the matches can result in memorable come-from-behind moments where you go from being on the defensive to moving in for the “kill,” so to speak. The loser just comically falls into a pool of water – this is Nintendo, after all. Switch Sports’ version of tennis is almost exactly like it was in Wii Sports, and you can only play doubles (with other players or against NPCs), which differentiates it from the 1v1 matches of badminton. It feels far more timing-oriented than badminton too, but it does give you the ability to slice and lob based on how you hit the ball. Those differences make it better for bigger parties, but it feels shallow by comparison. Switch Sports includes online play, which allows you to unlock additional cosmetic options for your characters, but we weren’t able to test it out during our review period. However, I primarily consider Switch Sports to be an in-person party game, and could not care less about how my character looks, so even if online play doesn’t work at all for some reason, I wouldn’t be terribly broken up about it – the lack of depth to these games means that if I’m not playing it in a living room with friends, I might as well be playing against an NPC. It’s unlikely to take you more than an hour or two with some friends to play through everything Switch Sports has to offer. While simplicity is what makes it work so well as a party starter, its selection of six sports feels meager in comparison to Wii Sports Resort’s 12 games. The lack of golf at launch is also sorely missed, but it’s an exciting prospect to hit the links again when the DLC is released this fall. Nintendo Switch Sports, like Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort before it, is best played as a party game, broken out for any gathering that needs a quick injection of goofy, active fun. While its sparse mixture of old and new sports varies in quality, Switch Sports largely sticks the landing on what made its predecessors memorable: intuitive motion controls, the ability to effortlessly get a group of people up and moving, and some killer menu music that’s liable to get stuck in your head all day. Just don’t expect to spend a whole lot of time with it before the novelty wears off. Nintendo Switch Sports "
150,LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga ,8.0,"Adventure. Excitement. A Jedi craves not these things. If that’s the case, then all Jedi should probably cancel their preorders for LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, since this dazzling new entry in Traveller’s Tales’ longrunning LEGO game series has brought both adventure and excitement by the plastic bucketload. With stunning set pieces cribbed from all nine mainline Star Wars films and a surprisingly vast number of iconic planet hubs to freely explore in between, The Skywalker Saga is a brick-breaking blockbuster executed with a goofy charm that had me feeling as happy as a droid in a hot oil bath. In a dramatic departure from the zoomed out camera perspective of previous LEGO titles, The Skywalker Saga features a tighter, over-the-shoulder third-person view typical of the likes of Gears of War or Uncharted, and it brings along with it far greater control over your attacks. Lightsabers can be boomeranged and crates can be Force-pushed with satisfying precision, and a simple combo system allows you to launch enemies into the air for a juggling volley of saber swings with ease. Fighting as a Jedi or Sith might not have the depth of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, but it’s nonetheless fast, fluid, and it feels fantastic.  If you’re controlling a character equipped with a blaster, you now have the option of taking cover behind walls and other objects to pick your foes off from afar, and can switch between cover positions with the tap of the button. (A similar cover-based mechanic was featured in 2016's LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but only in specific sections of a level).  I love the neat touch atop this system that you’re able to quickly rebuild destroyed cover (as can enemies), but outside of a couple of specific boss fights I hardly ever felt the need to actually shelter behind anything. In The Skywalker Saga, the combination of a constantly recharging health bar and the authentic inaccuracy of each Stormtrooper’s shots meant there was rarely any risk in taking a run and gun approach. I certainly still enjoyed the gunplay in The Skywalker Saga, but more for its flashy spectacle than its shallow attempts at strategy. Not only does the new close-up perspective make you feel more engrossed in the action, it also leads to a greater appreciation of how realistically rendered each individual LEGO brick is. 2021’s Hot Wheels Unleashed set a new standard for high fidelity virtual plastic, and The Skywalker Saga certainly matches it down to every last plastic seam and textured hair piece, with the paint on minifigs chipping away convincingly after extended use as though they’re a much-loved toy. Absolutely every LEGO creation looks so uncannily true to life, that when you blast an immaculately assembled 1000-piece Tie Fighter out of the sky, you can almost hear the cries of anguish from the parent who spent their whole Sunday afternoon helping their kid build it. The LEGO games have always lent a Spaceballs-style silliness to their recreations of iconic Star Wars scenes and The Skywalker Saga is no different, consistently seeking out the lighter side of the Force in even the most somber of situations. Whether it’s Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader discussing the new Death Star while rows of Stormtroopers awkwardly topple over like dominos in the background, or a confused Darth Sidious accidentally issuing Order 67 instead of 66 and forcing all the clone troopers to spontaneously start disco dancing rather than commit mass Jedi genocide, The Skywalker Saga consistently finds a way to gently mock its source material with wonderfully absurd and hilarious results. Amazingly, even the events of The Rise of Skywalker are substantially more enjoyable when they’re deliberately ridiculous, as opposed to accidentally so. It’s not just The Skywalker Saga’s sense of humour that kept me engaged, but its mission variety too. Though never quite as daring or inventive as 2021’s It Takes Two, the 45 main story levels constantly switch things up so that the action never grows stale. The Skywalker Saga is capable of delivering mindless carnage on a massive scale, like when The Battle of Naboo briefly blossoms into a thrilling game of tower defense, and you gleefully lob balls of energy from Gungan catapults to decimate hordes of Trade Federation droids and assault tanks. Yet it can also be more focused and cerebral, such as when Rey enters the mirror cave on Temple Island, and you carefully puppeteer her reflections in order to reach exit portal switches. This is on top of the fan-pleasing standards, of course, and The Skywalker Saga does indeed feature levels designed around high-speed podracing, X-Wing trench runs and all the major lightsaber duels you’d expect. But even at its most familiar moments, the campaign is still a blast to play because it feels so smooth and is such an eye-popping sight to behold. The only occasional catch is that its strict adherence to a cinematic style of presentation can come across as a bit too rigid at times. In one of the boss fights against Kylo Ren, for instance, I’d whittled his health bar down to zero, yet the fight arbitrarily continued for another minute, all so I could button-mash my way through the remaining quicktime events. Each story mission is connected by surprisingly sizeable hub areas situated on some 20-odd different planets, from the sandswept streets of Mos Eisley on Tatooine to the polished surfaces of Coruscant's Financial District, and everywhere in between. These open areas are absolutely rife with hidden Kyber bricks to collect by solving various environmental puzzles, and while you do see some repeated challenges across the galaxy – stacking crates to reach Kyber bricks suspended in the air seems to be a popular task no matter which planet you’re on – there are plenty of other fun little surprises to stumble upon along the way. I particularly enjoyed the Lemmings-inspired challenge on Kamino that tasked me with adjusting a series of platforms to prevent a hapless clone from shuffling to his doom, or arranging a choir of Wookiees on Kashyyyk to angrily yawn a rendition of John Williams’ signature score. Collected Kyber bricks serve as a currency that, in addition to studs, can be invested into upgrades – either core perks shared by all characters, or class specific enhancements. While many of the core upgrades seemed like no-brainers to me, such as widening the radius in which your character automatically hoovers up dropped studs or increasing the speed with which they build objects, the vast majority of class specific perks seemed unnecessary given that The Skywalker Saga’s difficulty level is already all too easy. What incentive is there to give bounty hunters the ability to spot enemies through walls when I can easily dispatch whoever is on the other side with a couple of blaster bolts, even if they get the jump on me? While I primarily stayed on target and focused on the main mission path, once I had finished all the story missions I spent a few more hours revisiting my favourite locations and completing side missions to unlock additional characters, and then swapping them in and out of my touring party in order to utilise their unique abilities to solve specific problems. It’s during these moments, when you’re jetting from one solar system to the next and cruising down to a planet’s surface to run odd jobs for local townsfolk, that The Skywalker Saga starts to resemble some sort of adorable Mass Effect for minifigs. And if you get tired of exploring and action-platforming your way across the wealth of planets, you can always just pick your favourite starship and jet up into orbit for some impromptu dogfighting. There really is a staggering amount to do in The Skywalker Saga, and despite the fact I’ve spent over 20 hours with the game I feel like I’ve only just scratched the surface – there are seemingly enough collectible LEGO vehicles and minifigs in here to populate several hundred letters to Santa. The one Star Destroyer-sized blight on my experience with The Skywalker Saga was the bug I encountered that made progressing the story of the prequel trilogy beyond Attack of the Clones impossible. Playing on Xbox Series X, I experienced a crash while trying to launch a mission hunting for Jango Fett, and when I rebooted The Skywalker Saga that mission marker was gone from the map and menus with seemingly no way of retriggering it. Since you can hop in and out of each episode and play the three trilogies in any order, I was still able to complete Episodes IV through to IX on my original save, but I needed to create a new game in order to play through Episodes I to III, during which the game breaking bug was thankfully no longer present. (At the time of writing, the developer has told me they are working on a patch to prevent the issue.)  I also noticed some slight problems with The Skywalker Saga’s drop-in/drop-out local co-op mode. Across the nine episodes, I spent about half of it playing solo and the other with my son as a co-op partner. On balance, I had substantially more fun with a second player onboard and the comedic chaos it created, but the diminished field of view within the confines of the vertical split-screen did make combat feel a bit imprecise and exploration slightly more disorientating. Additionally, one player always seemed to get the rough end of the gaffi stick when it came to the story mode boss fights, relegated to the role of a comparatively impotent companion droid while the other player indulged in a spectacular lightsaber duel. At one stage in the climactic confrontation between Obi-Wan and Anakin on the molten surface of Mustafar, I spent a significant stretch as C-3PO stranded as a spectator on a hovering platform while all the action unfolded below. It left me feeling a bit C-3PO’d. LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga provides some rollicking reimaginings of Star Wars’ most iconic moments and seats them inside a series of interplanetary playgrounds that are dense with discovery and entertaining diversions. Certain elements like its upgrade and cover systems feel somewhat superfluous, and co-op has some notable drawbacks, but there were otherwise enough laugh out loud gags and surprising shifts in gameplay to keep me thoroughly engaged from the opening crawl of Episode I all the way through to the end of Episode IX – which is more than I can say for the actual movies. "
151,Tiny Tina's Wonderlands ,8.0,"Shoot thousands of goblins in the face with a flaming crossbow, throw gigantic meteors at gross anthropomorphic mushrooms, and hang out with a queen horse that’s literally made out of diamonds. That’s Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands in a nutshell, and if that all sounds like a reskinned Borderlands 3, it’s because it is. But that doesn’t end up being such a bad thing! The excellent writing and stellar voice acting performances combine beautifully with the twisted and insane FPS mayhem to create something extremely memorable. This fantasy twist on the Borderlands formula delivers the adventure I dreamt of playing ever since playing the Borderlands 2 DLC that inspired it, and although it very much plays it safe in a lot of ways, it’s been an absolute blast so far.   Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is an outrageous, fantasy-infused spinoff of the OG looter shooter and a direct follow-up to the Borderlands 2: Tiny Tina’s Assault on Dragon Keep DLC from 2013. As a game within a game, Wonderlands has you playing through a simulated tabletop roleplaying campaign called Bunkers and Badasses, a sort of alternate-reality Dungeons and Dragons that replaces generic fantasy tropes with absurdity, gratuitous violence, and tons of guns regardless of whether they’re setting-appropriate or not. But that’s the magic of this larger-than-life looter-shooter RPG, which throws caution to the wind and embraces chaos and nonsense in favor of ludicrous and memorable moments. The best thing about a Borderlands game is I know I’m going to laugh as I loot, and Wonderlands is no exception. The excellent, laugh-out-loud writing is elevated by one of the strongest comedy casts of any game, with Ashly Burch returning as the loveably obnoxious Tiny Tina, Will Arnett as the main bad guy, Andy Samberg as the over-eager dumb party member, and Wanda Sykes as the rules-obsessed player. Across the board the voice acting and comedy writing are better than they’ve ever been in this series, and even without all the action-packed looting and shooting the adventure would be worthwhile just for the memorable characters and hilarious moments. There’s a mission where you try to figure out how to remove a character’s impenetrable “plot armor,” another where the characters get way too suspicious about a background character in a blue hat, and another where you straight-up kill a bunch of Smurfs. The shenanigans never cease, and fans of tabletop roleplaying (like myself) will find plenty of references and inside jokes that are catnip for veteran dice-rollers. That said, even while the tomfoolery is ever-amusing, the main story ends up being one of the weaker parts of the package. The pattern in Borderlands games to date has been that the dumb dialogue and silly sidequests obscure an over-arching story that’s actually quite good, with characters we care about and moments of genuine emotion and shocking twists. I kept expecting Wonderlands to follow the same format, but instead it turns into a pretty predictable race towards a big bad guy you need to defeat before the credits roll. The fact that the whole adventure takes place within a game being played by Borderlands characters which has little to no impact on anything leaves the proceedings feeling pretty frivolous rather than innovative or subversive and not quite up to the standards the Borderlands series has set. But man, it’s still so dang funny. What We Said About Borderlands 3 If Borderlands 3 is what happens when a modern looter shooter doesn’t concern itself with the longevity of its item economy and daily quests then you can sign me up for Borderlands 4 right now. Being untethered from persistent servers and able to trade loot at will is a refreshing change of pace, but that’s hardly the only reason why this such an amazing co-op FPS. The sheer magnitude and diversity of its arsenal of fun and surprising weaponry is unmatched, and the striking amount of loving detail and variety packed into its energetic and replayable 30-hour campaign is what makes Borderlands 3 a high-point for the series – and the genre as a whole. Of course, most people come to Borderlands expecting a whole heck of a lot of guns to play with, and Wonderlands does not disappoint in that regard. Per usual, you’ll find thousands of variations of randomly generated weapons with silly and insane perks, like an automatic crossbow that feels like ye olde machine gun or a shotgun that turns into a fireball you throw at an enemy when it runs out of ammo. The transition from over-the-top science fiction to over-the-top high fantasy has surprisingly changed very little about the way Borderlands feels to play, though there are some notable exceptions such as grenades being replaced with much more interesting spells and ultimate abilities shifting to a more magical flair, like summoning giant tornadoes of ice. Other than that the differences are largely cosmetic changes to combat, so Borderlands fans should feel right at home in the Wonderlands. The similarity to Borderlands 3 is good news in that combat in Wonderlands is generally fantastic, with crazy-looking enemies, challenging boss fights, and so much insanity happening on-screen that oftentimes your screen looks like a rainbow puked into a tornado that exploded into a hundred smaller tornadoes. The sliding, shooting, and casting in Wonderlands is a seriously good time. The downside of all that chaos is that it’s sometimes difficult to know what’s even happening; more than once I died and found myself thinking “M’kay, not sure what killed me there.” But at least it looked cool! The only other real gripe I have is that it changes so little from Borderlands 3 that even with the setting being completely different I felt like I’d played it all before in the decade of time I’ve been enjoying the series already. For example, the Goliath enemies that have been around since Borderlands 2 have the very specific behavior of entering a rampage if you shoot their heads too much. Once enraged, they run around attacking everything and every time they score a kill they evolve into a more powerful monster. In Wonderlands there’s an enemy called the Cyclops that behaves almost identically. That’s not to say that there aren’t any surprises, but the amount of reskinned or reused enemies and ideas definitely made me raise an eyebrow on more than one occasion. One major thing Wonderlands does change is swapping out static and distinct character classes for a system that’s much more fluid, for better and for worse. Rather than choosing one class represented by a single character with a specific roster of abilities, you’ll instead make your own and pick from a list of six stripped-down character classes that you can mix and match down the road as you unlock your second skill tree. Now you might find you have some abilities in common with someone who picked a different class, which is in stark contrast to past games where each class has a unique role in the combat meta. That’s a good thing because it means you can make your character class your own, but a not-so-good thing because it makes classes feel samey when you’re playing with a full squad of four.  Wonderlands also adds a charming overworld where instead of running and gunning in first-person, you walk around a map as a cartoonish avatar exploring the world and finding new activities and side quests to complete. It’s easy to navigate, and discovering new areas and unlocking new pathways in this silly board game landscape is a great and inspired way to break up the fast-paced combat and explosions with dumb gags, like one part where you’ve got to get past a cheese puff that’s been dropped onto the board by Bunker Master herself. Unfortunately, it also enables one of my least favorite parts of the Wonderlands package: combat encounters. These are a completely underwhelming new feature that sticks you in a claustrophobically small arena and throws some randomly generated monsters at you until you fill up a murder meter, earn some loot, and move on. You’ll run into these bland little battles while exploring the overworld, as filler during part of a side quest, or even in the endgame, which uses it in a horde mode. The main issue I have with combat encounters is that unlike most of the Wonderlands campaign, where you’re exploring a large hub world and looking for hidden loot and secrets to discover, these things stick you in a box and essentially put you on a timeout until you’ve killed enough things. It’s unimaginative filler that only succeeds in throwing a wet blanket onto a formula that didn’t need slowing down. Worse yet, combat encounters oftentimes spawn enemies so slowly that you end up waiting for more baddies to appear so you can fill up the kill meter, especially if you’re dealing a lot of damage and/or playing with friends. It doesn’t help that these scraps feature the same enemies you encounter over the course of the campaign and so offer no surprises – just more of the same bad guys you’ve already killed a hundred times before.  And then, when you finish the story after around 20 hours and unlock Wonderlands’ primary endgame activity, The Chaos Chamber, you’ll discover it’s basically just a variation on combat encounters. That’s a bit of a disappointment, but thankfully it works a bit better as an endgame activity, owing to its high degree of difficulty and roguelike mechanics thrown in to make things more interesting – not to mention it’s definitely the most rewarding activity from a loot and XP perspective.  Speaking of endgame content, Wonderlands has quite a grind available for those looking for more to do. Not only is there a nigh-limitless pool of loot to chase, but Myth Ranks, which allow you to over-level your character and unlock unique buffs, give you quite a mountain to hike up if you aren’t finished smacking people in the face with an enchanted frying pan. I don’t think that The Chaos Chamber endgame mode will be enough to keep me grinding for long after the campaign, but with at least four pieces of DLC announced by Gearbox already, it’s good to know that my leveling and min-maxing won’t go to waste if I decide to stick with it. Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands is a fantastic fantasy take on Borderlands’ tried-and-true looter shooter formula. As spin-offs go, it sticks dangerously close to its past successes which at times felt a bit unoriginal and some of the new stuff it tries, like procedurally generated combat encounters, didn’t pan out terribly well. Luckily, the excellent writing, hilarious performances from an all-star cast, and ridiculous combat continue to shine brightly and make this tabletop-inspired explosion-fest absolutely worth your time. "
152,Kirby and the Forgotten Land ,8.0,"Kirby is no stranger to reinvention. His ability to transform himself into all sorts of shapes and sizes aside, the games he’s in often experiment with new settings and gimmicks as well – whether it’s rolling a limbless Kirby with the DS stylus in Canvas Curse, piloting mechs in Planet Robobot, or fundamentally changing how he transforms in Epic Yarn. Kirby and the Forgotten Land might seem like another addition to that list at first glance, this time warping the traditionally 2D structure into 3D levels. But in reality, this platformer feels like the next big step for a more classic Kirby formula rather than an upheaval of it, and it’s one that skillfully translates the things I love about Kirby into a fresh – but still familiar – new perspective. The Kirby series isn’t one I would have pinned as the type for a trip to a post-apocalyptic setting, but after a wormhole opens above Dream Land, the ruined remains of a seemingly human society are exactly where we find our pink protagonist. Amidst the rusted buildings and pleasantly vibrant overgrowth is a group of Waddle Dees looking to settle down in their new home… or they would be, if they weren’t all immediately kidnapped by monsters. And with that simple but effective setup out of the way, it’s up to Kirby to venture through this dilapidated world to rescue as many as he can and help them to rebuild their town.  Doing so requires you to float your way through a series of linear levels, sucking up enemies to steal their powers and finding secrets along the way. Obviously the shift from 2D changes how exactly you go about doing that, but the movement, combat, and general way alternate paths or items are hidden are all recognizable and satisfying – others have likened it to Mario’s own perspective shift in Super Mario 3D World, and I don’t think it’s an unfair comparison to make. It’s also a joy to track down the Waddle Dees hiding in optional offshoots and secret alcoves, especially since new buildings will spring up in town as its population increases, giving you the opportunity to purchase item buffs, unlock ability upgrades, and even play a few cute little minigames like fishing. The levels themselves blend platforming puzzles with combat throughout, and the dozen or so copy abilities you get by inhaling certain enemies have amusing roles to play in both. Combat is fairly simple, but the different flavor each ability brings keeps it interesting whether you’re burning baddies with fire or shooting them with a literal gun. On the platforming side, options like the ice ability let you safely skate across hazardous terrain while the sword can cut certain ropes to open new paths. All of these abilities are used in consistently clever ways, with every level pushing you to swap between them as different situations or gated sections arise. Forgotten Land isn’t a very challenging game (even on its optimistically named “Wild Mode” difficulty), but it’s far from a mindless one – not like Yoshi’s latest outing in Crafted World, for example, which was fun but had some levels where you could essentially just hold the stick to the right until you reached the goal. Here, harder enemies push you to move around and make the most of each ability’s limited move set, especially during the handful of creatively constructed boss fights, and secrets can range from being hidden practically in plain sight to being surprisingly well tucked away. I only died once or twice in my roughly 10-hour playthrough, but after the first couple of stages it was rare for me to 100% a level on my initial run through it, and I was frequently tempted back in to dig up everything I had missed. That said, it can sometimes be a little unclear when something is a secret path or just a gap in the terrain decorations with an annoying invisible wall, but that was only an occasional inconvenience. Those decorations and some of the mechanics around them are distinguished by the themed “worlds” every stage is sorted into, including settings like a water-focused beach area, a snowy landscape with buildings inspired more by British architecture, and an illuminated carnival ground. Forgotten Land can be an unexpectedly pretty game, especially during its personality-filled cutscenes, with a great use of color throughout and some elaborate locations at times – be those complex circus rides or rundown mall interiors. But while each world is enjoyably varied, the post-apocalyptic setting as a whole isn’t necessarily the most thrilling one. Kirby inevitably ends up jumping across different flavors of rusty rooftop or crumbling city street in every world, and this wasteland just isn’t as cool as any of the fantastical places he’s visited in his own universe. That extends somewhat to the new “Mouthful” abilities he can use, which includes the now-notorious car transformation. These are everyday objects that Kirby can’t quite swallow, instead altering his body while his mouth is wrapped around them (gross) to let you navigate a specific area ahead of you. Call me old fashioned, but Kirby mostly turning into a vending machine would be more odd than it was clever if it weren’t for the fun way these Mouthful powers are used and revisited throughout the campaign. The car lets you drive fast through some exciting tracks designed for speed, the vending machine slows your movement but lets you rapidly fire cans out of your mouth, and one hilarious circular object basically turns Kirby into a giant air blaster that can be used to spin fans, knock over enemies, and even power little boats through the water. I’m not sure how Developer HAL Laboratory did it, but they managed to make traffic cones, scissor lifts, and even large, nondescript metal pipes into genuinely entertaining transformations. You’re also given additional opportunities to test your expertise with all of Kirby’s powers (Mouthful or not) in the special Treasure Road challenges between levels. These bonus rooms give you a specific ability in a race against time, rewarding you with a special star if you can make it to the end of an obstacle course fast enough and a handful of the coin-based currency if you can do so under a certain target time. The Treasure Roads ended up being some of my favorite parts of Forgotten Land, acting as quick bites of optional challenge that often made the smartest use of what each transformation could do. For example, the fact that the cutter ability’s blade boomerangs back to you might just add a little extra damage during fights in a regular level, but in a Treasure Road mastering that behavior could be the difference between hitting the target time or not. The coin reward for doing so is a fairly insubstantial draw on its own, but that didn’t stop me from frequently trying to refine my movement and push my time below it anyway. Those stars you get feed into another neat addition too: blueprints hidden in levels (or sometimes just handed to you after big fights) which will unlock upgraded versions of specific abilities that you can buy with stars and coins, like giving your cutter two blades instead of one. That helps keep them fresh all the way through, even if it very rarely changes how you’ll actually think about using them in a given situation. Thanks to my relatively thorough playstyle I always had enough stars and coins to unlock all of them as soon as I found their blueprints until nearly the very end, which means the process of going back to town to pay for an upgrade after finding each blueprint was largely symbolic – but hey, the point is that my fire ability makes me look like a dragon now. Forgotten Land also has co-op play, but the way that’s been implemented is one of its few letdowns. It’s nice that a second player can hop in at pretty much any time, but doing so feels very much like a “younger sibling” mode. Player two can only play as Bandana Waddle Dee, who wields a spear and disappointingly can’t use any abilities, which past Kirby games have often allowed your partner to do. To make matters worse, the camera remains focused squarely on Kirby with no regard for the second player, frequently causing them to fall off screen and teleport back to you like the world’s shortest yo-yo. It’s still a fun time to run through levels or boss fights in co-op, it’s just a far cry from the best co-op a Kirby game has seen. Kirby and the Forgotten Land successfully warps the series’ already fun mix of ability-based combat, platforming, and secret hunting into the third dimension. The post-apocalyptic setting may not be as thematically interesting as Planet Popstar, but it is still lovely and vibrant, with cleverly designed levels that make consistently smart use of Kirby’s abilities. Despite the change in perspective, Forgotten Land maintains most of what I love about classic Kirby games – and if the future means more 3D adventures for our hungry pink hero, I’d be more than happy to swallow them up. "
153,Ghostwire: Tokyo ,7.0,"Tokyo's Shibuya district is one of the liveliest places on the planet. Day or night, it's generally densely packed with people and positively thrumming with energy. Ghostwire: Tokyo shows us another side of this iconic urban hub, after a supernatural force leaves its streets eerily deserted. It's a nightmarish vision, but an absolutely incredible recreation nonetheless – this city slice feels astonishingly like the real thing (albeit with more conspicuous shrines), and the game's dedication to its setting is paired with an equal level of zeal for embracing Japanese folklore and tradition. The catch, however, is that it’s let down by bland mission design and one-dimensional combat, making it a lot less fun to actually play than it is to enjoy as a virtual tourist. Ghostwire: Tokyo has not one, but two protagonists. Akito is the lone corporeal survivor of the mysterious fog that turned Shibuya into a literal ghosttown and was in a bad place even before the spirits hit the fan. His sister in a nearby hospital, he’s desperate to discover what’s become of her, but now finds himself in an uneasy alliance with KK, a surly spirit out to settle a score with the Hannya mask-wearing madman responsible for the attack. This ""uneasy alliance"" by the way, means literally fighting for control over the one body. Their initial angry clashes soon give way to a shared goal and growing understanding, and while I didn’t find either character hugely relatable, their family-focused backstories helped ground the grandiose main plot. Plus, with KK along for the ride, Akito gains a host of supernatural powers, all the better to deal with the many unsettling Visitors lurking on the streets.  Working towards discovering what’s actually going on will feel extremely familiar to anyone who's played an open-world game since Assassin's Creed. In this instance, the map starts out almost entirely cloaked in toxic fog, and it's only by cleansing torii gates across it that new areas of the city become accessible. It's not actually such a bad thing that this open world starts out closed for business. Ghostwire: Tokyo is incredibly dense, so steadily working through new sections of the city to reach and purify gates meant that I got to appreciate every side of this game world, and it feels like there are hundreds of them. Tokyo, after all, is a city of contrasts: between the glitz of modernity and the quiet reflection of tradition, between the intensity of its concrete jungle and the pockets of greenery that provide an escape, between tourist hotspots and forgotten tenements, and between towering shopping complexes and dingy back alleys packed with tiny bars. These aspects of the city are perfectly captured by Ghostwire's sprawling map and incredible attention to detail, making it feel like a truly believable place... albeit one trapped within a perpetual night, where even the regular downpours can't wash away the reminders that hundreds of thousands of people suddenly and inexplicably vanished. There are piles of clothes everywhere, trapped spirits floating in the air and ghosts with unfinished business to help. Ghostwire’s world is also a thoroughly modern snapshot of Shibuya. This is not an idealised version of the area, but one which reflects its growing pains as prolonged gentrification changes its very nature. In this game there's still plenty of the old, edgy Shibuya to explore, as well as numerous other aspects of the ward that exist outside the touristy core, but alongside those we have the shiny new developments that have fundamentally altered its skyline, not to mention a number of construction sites that herald yet more change. Ghostwire: Tokyo captures a specific moment in this district's life, and it makes for an impressively multifaceted setting. It's dense with collectables, too. Saving the spirits hovering all over the city is a great way to net XP, while tracking down Jizo statues can help expand how much elemental ammo you can carry. There are also money pots to smash, consumables to stockpile, culturally significant objects to discover (and then sell, oddly), notes that net you instant skill points, tanukis in disguise and citywide sources of ether – the fuel for your attacks. It's a lot. Thankfully, your Spectral Vision ability lets you send out a pulse which highlights anything of interest nearby, from enemies on the prowl through to souls to be saved, so finding collectables never comes down to a pixel hunt. You'll even hear chimes for objects of particular interest as the pulse spreads, letting you know when there's something important close at hand just waiting to be found. Yokai play a prominent role across the city, too; appropriate, given these many and varied supernatural entities play such a large part in traditional Japanese folklore. Different areas are home to different types of yokai, and receiving their power helps unlock more options within Akito’s skill trees. Yokai occupy other roles, too: flying Tengu can be grappled onto in order to reach the rooftop forests of the city, while yokai cat merchants are found across the map manning (catting?) convenience stores and roadside stalls alike. While a big part of Ghostwire: Tokyo's appeal for me is how rooted it is in Japanese culture and mythology, these elements sometimes feel like a crutch. The yokai hunts, for instance, rely on the ""otherness"" of the entities, along with some very light cultural insight, to make up for their lack of actual challenge. Sure, you might be tailing an anthropomorphic umbrella, but strip that away and all you’re left with is the simplest and least interesting form of gameplay possible. Similarly, when thinking back to my playthrough, the side-quests that most spring to mind are the ones with the best Japanese window dressing: the trip into a neighbourhood sento bathhouse, a mural of Mount Fuji painted on the wall, or a park full of dead cherry trees that I brought back into radiant pink blossom. Side-quests that lack hooks like these, on the other hand, feel like busywork. Finding toilet paper for a spirit that's on the crapper? I mean, I guess we could chalk it up as a PaRappa the Rapper reference, but instead of wandering a couple of metres to find a spare roll, this kind of task brings into stark relief the fact that I really should be focused on the madman planning on consuming thousands of souls in some kind of epic dark ritual. Why on Earth would I care about the spirit that’s stuck on the thunder box? It doesn't help that there's limited ability to sell these small stories due to the fact that the NPCs are ethereal spirits with comically pitch-shifted voices who are minimally animated and have no discernable facial expressions. It's hardly a storyteller's dream. And again, it's compounded by the rote simplicity of the tasks themselves. Even when there's a topic with some weight, such as a series of suicides in a rundown building, the resolution is invariably simplistic – an evil specter! – as is the gameplay. While this particular location was enjoyably bleak and atmospheric, the reality is that clearing rooms, purging spirits and finding a key that’s demeaningly close to hand, is just more of the same. So disappointing were the side-quests on balance, in fact, that I largely stopped paying attention to them midway through my playthrough. The Evil Within 2 gives you more options to play your way in a much bigger survival-horror playground than the original. Although a disjointed plot and weak protagonist make it slow to get started, being pursued through an intriguingly bizarre world by plentiful and disturbing monsters kept my palms sweaty and my heart in my throat thanks to a strict adherence to the most important survival horror rule: you should always be on the back foot. It's combat, however, that fuels most of Ghostwire: Tokyo's gameplay, and its system of elemental attacks offers a pretty fresh take on first-person ranged combat – it just doesn’t go far enough to develop it into something special. The presentation is excellent though, from  the hand movements that accompany attacks through to the way enemy cores are revealed and then ripped away using ethereal strings. And while many of the enemies aren’t necessarily exciting to fight, I do like the idea of mixing the otherworldly and the mundane in their designs. After all, what could be more fitting on the streets of post-apocalyptic Tokyo than to be fighting faceless office workers and uniformed school children? I also loved the small touch that you'll occasionally see a Visitor engaged in a basic but very human action, such as knocking on a door, or seemingly paying its respects at a grave, as this haunting echo of normalcy left me wondering whether these creatures really should be so mercilessly dispatched. Wind, water, and fire attacks form the baseline of your arsenal, but you have a number of other options, such as stealth kills, talismans that can stun and distract, a weak strike attack for close quarters, a bow for longer range, and the ability to block to minimise incoming damage, or – if timed correctly – parry an enemy. Despite all this, I spent the vast majority of Ghostwire: Tokyo employing two simple tactics because they were so effective I rarely needed anything else. The first was to Quick Purge (stealth kill) absolutely everything. The Visitors are about as basic an enemy as you'll find in a modern video game, which makes sneaking up behind them laughably simple most of the time. And with Spectral Vision, you can easily stay out of sight close by and just wait for the right moment to strike. Taking out enemy after enemy this way definitely starts out satisfying – helped in no small part by the fantastic purge animations and sound effects – but it's ultimately very one dimensional, as my approach didn’t need to change significantly even as new enemies or fresh variants of old ones were introduced. All but a couple of the most powerful overworld enemies can be insta-killed with this approach. On hard difficulty too. And once I realised how powerful and simple to execute it was, I sunk skill points into speeding up my crouched movement and juicing up my Spectral Vision to make it more efficient, and eventually found some beads that reduced my likelihood of detection to top it off. And for scenarios in which stealth wasn't an option, or when I was detected, well, I just took the vast majority of the combat options I mentioned before and put them into a box labelled ""back up plan,"" because the BFG (or Big Fireball Grenade, in this case) was the obvious solution to every problem. And, thanks to the rudimentary Visitor AI, I could just back up while charging it; and like lambs to the slaughter, they would come to meet my fiery vengeance. Fireballs are devastatingly effective against both individuals and groups, and given enough space you can outpace even the fastest Visitors. All I had to do was find time to rip the cores out of enemies without being hit, avoid projectiles, and manage the severely limited fire ammo, and I was golden. Like stealth kills, this one tactic can be applied to almost every situation, regardless of the enemy makeup, resulting in another one dimensional, one-size-fits-all combat strategy. To be fair, I did use the other elements. Once I'd levelled up my wind attacks a little they actually felt pretty powerful, and came in handy when I ran out of fire ammo or wanted to finish off a straggler or two. Again, given the basic AI, you can back up while Visitors walk into your wind shots just as effectively as you can with fire. It’s simply slower. And as for water, well, I used charged water attacks against Visitors holding umbrellas out as shields, but rarely used this element otherwise. It just feels completely ineffectual out of the gate, which is a shame because I’m sure you’re probably meant to use specific elements against specific enemies. Instead, my Prince Zuko-esque dedication to literal firepower was all-consuming. The downside of this approach was constantly running out of fire ammo, and thus having to spend time in the middle of fights running off to punch crystalised cars and vending machines to try and recover it – a slow process, given fire ether is by far the rarest type and scarcity is the sole check on its power. This meant that while I exclusively used charged fire attacks to beat the final boss, I had to spend more time running around the arena punching things to gather ammo than I did actually fighting it… which is not really what you want from a final boss. It also meant that other systems were so irrelevant that I often forgot about them. I think I used the Wire In special ability, which refills Akito’s spirit ammunition and heightens his abilities for a short period, only a handful of times in 20 hours, and while two of the talisman types in my inventory definitely came in clutch in a few instances (stunning groups of enemies in particular is a great way to get damage in) it would have been nice if these had been part of the regular makeup of combat, as opposed to a case of ""smash glass if you remember these exist during an emergency."" And for a game that likes to play tricks on your mind during story missions, it’s a shame Ghostwire doesn’t do more of that during its moment-to-moment gameplay in the overworld. Some of the stronger enemies sometimes triggered environmental effects, like rain falling upwards, corruption seeping into the surroundings, or paint on the road lifting up to flutter in the air, and that stuff was brilliant, enriching the atmosphere and creating a feeling of simmering psychological uncertainty that I really enjoyed. I only wish that Ghostwire went a couple more steps down that road and into more of an outright horror stance. And as for the main story itself, at its heart this is a game about the growing openness between Akito and KK, and in turn, their quests to be at peace with the lives they’ve lived. The importance of family is a recurring theme in both the heroes’ stories and the villain’s and while I appreciate many aspects of it, the resolution of Akito's inner turmoil in particular missed the mark for me somewhat. Similarly, the villain’s messianic zeal and theatrically grand plan mean he's never more than a cartoonish big bad, so ultimately boiled down to being just another obstacle to overcome instead of a truly memorable character. I enjoyed my 20 or so hours with Ghostwire: Tokyo largely because I found its world so immersive. The attention to detail in the city itself is hugely impressive, whether it’s looking to recreate the surroundings of the best-known crossing in the world or bringing life to a dank back alley. This is an environment I loved being in, and all the more so because of the many touchstones to iconic elements of Japanese culture and mythology. If the moment-to-moment gameplay – in particular its one-dimensional combat and uninteresting mission design – weren’t such a disappointment, Ghostwire: Tokyo could have truly captivated me. As it stands, the merely adequate stealth and action do little to add to the fantastic setting, but they don’t diminish its brilliance, either. "
154,Tunic ,9.0,"Don’t let Tunic’s first-glance charm fool you. Actually, nevermind – go ahead and enjoy that charm. It’s a gorgeous game with a colorful, almost Link’s Awakening-esque art style, beautifully serene music, and an adorable sword-wielding fox for a protagonist. Enjoy it, because even though Tunic may look like a simplistic isometric action-adventure that draws clear inspiration from the early Legend of Zelda games, it is in reality a decidedly hardcore experience that will fiercely test both your mind and your combat abilities. It’s not “kiddier Zelda,” as its bushy-tailed hero suggests (though Tunic himself should be made into a real-life plush immediately). Instead, Tunic caught me off guard with its challenging combat and complex puzzles, and once I regained my footing I found that it executes on that premise wonderfully. One of my favorite things about Tunic is that, like the old-school classics it clearly takes inspiration from, it tells you nothing. Less than nothing, in fact: nearly all of its dialogue and in-game language is in an indecipherable script, Tunic never speaks, and there are no objective markers, hints, or breadcrumb trails to speak of. Everything must be intuited, which is done partly through exploration but primarily through the individual pages of the in-game instruction manual that you’ll find scattered about the world.  The booklet is modeled after what you’d find in the box in a NES-era game, complete with handwritten scribbles and annotations on some of the pages. This manual, too, is written in Tunic’s own language, but you’ll be able to suss out clues and directions from the images contained within – it doesn’t look like an IKEA instruction manual, but it’s a similar idea. Paying close attention to it is absolutely vital, as my cautionary tale proves; I ended up going into an early boss fight severely underpowered, but the frustration I felt as a result of that was my own fault for not reading the manual studiously enough to have figured out the key bit I was missing. It’s an exceptionally clever way to guide us through, even if it might have you seeking out the IGN wiki from time to time (no shame in that!). When you’re not nose-down in your pieced-together instruction manual, you’re out in either the overworld or one of the many dungeons where you’ll be slashing, blocking, dashing, and dodge-rolling your way to victory against Tunic’s wide variety of enemies. Importantly, you don’t really learn any new moves after you acquire the sword in the first hour; instead, it’s your tactics that will have to evolve. This includes making good use of not just that basic set of moves in new ways but also your items, the applications of which are also not explained at all. From sticks of dynamite to magic items later on – all of which you’ll find hidden in chests around the world and able to be bought from a terrifying but harmless shopkeeper – figuring out what each one does and employing them with smart strategies will lead to success far more often than quick button-mashing will. But sometimes you’ll need both. My favorite among those items is easily the aforementioned sticks of dynamite you’ll have access to right from the jump. They’re useful all game long, particularly during boss fights. Sure, they’re nice for clearing out clusters of bad guys, but against a boss’s intimidatingly large health bar the TNT is one of the most reliable ways to take sizable chunks off of it. They benefit from a certain… unpredictability in how they work due to their physics. Don’t try to throw them at an opponent on a ledge, for instance; sure, Tunic’s got a pretty good arm, but the dynamite doesn’t explode on contact. Rather, it will hit your target, then bounce off and roll around on the ground – depending how it lands – before finally combusting. Enemies in or around water are effectively impervious to dynamite as well, as the lit sticks instantly fizzle out if they touch water... as you’d expect if you think about it. No matter their size, your opponents are no pushovers – even the simplest of foes, like a Husher or a Autobolt, can drain your health rapidly. Their AI doesn’t stand out as overly smart or stupid, but each one hits with a wallop. Larger hero versions of the vanilla baddies of various types move slower but hit harder, and that healthy helping of boss battles are not to be taken lightly. Good luck. And if you’re wondering, you can only save your game at flame-lit shrines scattered about the world, and while doing so will restore your health and magic bars, the trade-off is that all of the enemies reset, too. That’s an obvious nod to Dark Souls. Let’s talk a little more about those boss battles. They are many, they are memorable, and they are the good kind of nasty. There are no difficulty settings to choose from in Tunic; there is only “Figure It Out.” A simple multi-hit sword-attack combo is both hinted at in your manual pages and something you might discover on your own anyway, and it will be crucial to your chances of survival. Even more vital to your ability to stand toe-to-toe with Tunic’s bosses, however, is the dodge roll that gives you a very brief window of invincibility. Mastering it is a must, as is being able to quickly cycle through the items you might need that aren’t already hotkeyed to X, Y, and B. The moment you finally take down each boss genuinely feels like a victory well-earned. As in a classic, top-down Zelda, Tunic has many Metroidvania-style layers to eventually peel back, and this, too, is part of what I love about it. When you see some place you can’t reach, or some door you can’t access, or something you can’t figure out how to activate, know that you will eventually get that tool – and when you return to see what’s been quietly making you crazy for many hours you’ll finally have satisfaction. Tunic’s world, in general, is a lovely place as well. The overworld is bright and colorful, while each dungeon has its own look and feel, from the traditional-fantasy spider cave at one end of the spectrum to the almost-sci-fi Monastery at the other. But Tunic’s mysteries don’t all show themselves early on and torture you until the late-game. Rather, new head-scratching conundrums are constantly revealing themselves, meaning you’ve always got a new lead to chase if you get frustrated or hit a dead end on the trail you’ve been following. This includes the run up to and past the endgame, where the knowledge you’ve accrued acts as momentum that can lead you to a number of puzzle-solves and revelations in short order as you go back and figure out things that you’ve previously walked by or stared at dozens of times, but there’s still plenty of brain-bending to be done after the credits roll as well. On that note, Tunic’s story is an interesting one as you piece it together, but admittedly not one I felt particularly moved by or satisfied with by the end. My 15-20-hour journey mattered a lot more than the destination for me, but perhaps you’ll feel differently. I completed the original Legend of Zelda when I was nine years old, but nine-year-old me wouldn’t have lasted long in Tunic. Though it may look adorably approachable thanks to its deceptively cute furry orange protagonist, Tunic quickly makes it clear that you’d best be ready for a fight. It is a fantastic Zelda-style game for the Elden Ring generation, and solving its ceaselessly clever campaign and challenging combat through careful studying of your indecipherable but intuitive in-game instruction booklet and agile controller work gave me a well-earned payoff and feeling of satisfaction that I won’t soon forget. "
155,Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin ,8.0,"Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin asks and answers the question of what the world of the first Final Fantasy, which came out in 1987, might look like in 2022 if it were reimagined with a modern action combat style. Its overly complex story and one-dimensional NPCs don't pay off until the final hours, but the freedom available in its challenging combat and extensive character customization is consistently rewarding from the start until – and after – the credits roll. It's a love letter to its own source material, filled with references and homages to the series’ history that seem designed to give fans of any Final Fantasy something to enjoy. Like the show Lost and other stories that revolve around some grand mystery, Stranger of Paradise's plot had me theorizing and scratching my head until the very final moments, when all is revealed in a way that brings everything together. However, where Lost used memorable characters and turning-point moments to carry the story forward prior to the big reveals, Stranger of Paradise misses the mark on its cast and instead solely relies on its solid action gameplay, only offering vague and often indecipherable clues to what’s going on. Its lack of real character development beyond your party of five run-of-the-mill characters making small talk and reiterating their need to find and kill an entity known as Chaos that threatens the world means I won’t be uttering their names in the same breath as Final Fantasy greats like Cloud and Yuna – or even necessarily remembering them a month from now.  And yet, while the early hours of the story did a poor job of keeping me engaged (especially as main character Jack and his starting companions Ash and Jed all revealed varying levels of amnesia and constantly remarked on their deja vu wherever we went) it turned out to be an effective buildup: the tail end did the exact opposite by answering all the questions I had. That said, I took the time to explore and find most of the memento collectibles as I played, which allowed me to connect the dots between the story the main story shows you and the story behind what's really happening in the world. Some filled in smaller gaps, like the origin and importance of the dark crystals that drew our starting party together in the first place, and others helped explain the meaning behind the titular stranger and the paradise they hail from. However, they’re easy to miss, and the ending and its big reveals might not have resonated as strongly for me if I hadn’t had their important context. While this isn’t a direct remake of the original Final Fantasy, it thoroughly reimagines many of its locations. The main city of Cornelia is where that first adventure began; and places like the Chaos Shrine and the Cavern of Earth dungeon have had new life breathed into them by Koei Tecmo's team, which seems to have found inspiration in similar areas from other Final Fantasy games. It merges in factories reminiscent of Final Fantasy 7 Remake's Mako Reactors, a pirate cove filled with Sahagin (like the Sastasha dungeon in Final Fantasy 14), and even something that strongly resembles Final Fantasy 13's Sunleth Waterscape's weather-changing mechanic makes an appearance in one of the wetlands you'll adventure through. There are plenty of other great locations that I won't spoil for you as it's equal part a treat and a puzzle for fans to discover which game inspired each of the stages in Stranger of Paradise. The fact that nearly every stage has a unique look kept exploring their ins and outs refreshing, and in the background there are new music arrangements from other FF games that are sure to catch the ears of longtime fans. Graphically, though, even the PlayStation 5’s HDR Quality mode couldn’t make Stranger of Paradise look better than average most of the time. Some cutscenes look great and instantly had me snapping away with the screenshot button, but those were few and far between. In-game it looks fine, with decent character models and textures that resemble Final Fantasy 13, but never good enough to make me wish it had a photo mode. After spending my first playthrough in Quality mode – which didn’t have any noticeable frame rate drops below 30 throughout the entire campaign, I made the switch to Performance mode and never looked back. The jump up to 60 frames per second makes dodging and parrying much easier for my playstyle, and some of the flashier combo abilities were even better because I was able to more reliably cancel out of them by swapping jobs to extend my combo even further. Stranger of Paradise offers five difficulty modes: casual, story, action, hard, and Chaos (which unlocks after your first playthrough), and the temptation of higher-level item drops led me to play on hard for my first run. It took me just under 30 hours to roll credits, and that included undertaking a good number of side missions I considered essential to raise my gear score, unlocking job roles for allies, replaying missions in up to three-player co-op, doing tons of inventory management, constantly upgrading/customizing my party’s loadouts, and no small amount of dying – especially when testing specific builds and multiclass combinations in boss fights to determine their suitability. At this setting just about every enemy posed a threat to my survival, from the lowly roundworm that turns into a wheel of purple flames to ever-deadly Tonberrys and their deadly chef’s knives and powerful area-of-effect attacks. There were even times where my own carelessness allowed a group of bats or skeletons to simply overwhelm me, rendering me unable to escape. It’s dangerous out there! You can always adjust the difficulty at any checkpoint, though, so if you find yourself under-leveled you can choose to make any single fight easier if you want – which is certainly preferable to grinding it out. Despite a lot of obvious Souls influence in its combat style, though, Stranger of Paradise is actually pretty forgiving when it comes to death: you keep all of the experience, materials, armor, weapons, and even additional potions you might have found – and the PS5’s speedy load times put you back in the action almost immediately. It’s not without consequences, though – other than having to run past or fight through the same swathes of enemies – you suffer a temporary decrease to your maximum MP, which nearly every combat ability is centered around. Spells like Cure and Fire, command abilities like Lancet and Lightbringer, and even class-based combo abilities like a Dragoon's Jump and a Warriors War Cry all require MP to function, so there’s an urgent need to recover all six sections as soon as possible. (Limiting the number of mana segments available is also a callback to the original Final Fantasy, where you had a limited number of spells you could cast before needing to rest at an inn or use the cottage/House recovery item to restore your MP.) The expectations around Final Fantasy 7 Remake are sky high, and it mostly manages to deliver. Its combat is top notch, its enemy variety kept me constantly entertained, and seeing this snippet of story fleshed out with real emotional arcs and the previously hidden humanity behind Midgar filled me with pure joy. The boring RPG filler and Kingdom Hearts-esque convolution that was inserted in between did stop my ear-to-ear grin from being constant, but never long enough to kill the mood completely. That leaves this remake as one that still delivered on letting me relive (part of) a classic in stupendous fashion, while also standing as a great RPG all its own. Thankfully, MP can be recovered in a few ways, including by depleting an enemy's Break gauge and finishing them off with a Soul Burst, which causes an explosion of crystal shards that knocks back other enemies in the process. These come with a variety of over-the-top animations that bring some nice levity to the combat – using Soul Burst on the Guardians of the Flying Fortress stage, for instance, has Jack pile-drive them into the ground, which is immediately followed up by a curbstomp to their nether regions to really add insult to injury. Soul Bursting Cactaurs, meanwhile, picks them up and flings them; he also gives the malicious Tonberrys a simple pat on the head before shattering them into pieces. He has a broad range. There are 28 jobs in total, each with their own skill trees, so there’s a lot of room to experiment and find combos that synergize well in your party, defining your playstyle. You can equip any two jobs on your character (and one on each of your companions, who you indirectly control), and while you can only have one active at any given time the fact that you’re able to swap between them at the press of a single button lets you extend combos creatively and synergistically. You can mix and match jobs however you like, such as combining two glass-cannon Mage jobs to build up your Intellect stat and make your spells hit harder and stun enemies by rapidly overwhelming their Break gauge, or you might combine Berserker and Warrior so that you can use the Warrior’s War Cry HP-regeneration skill to offset the Berserker’s inability to use healing potions while maintaining your Berserk status, which increases your offensive and defensive powers for a limited time. Alternatively, tanky jobs like Paladin and Knight can be combined for increased HP and stamina to reduce the impact incoming damage has on your Break gauge. My personal favorite, though, is multiclassing Sage – which blends black and white magic and grants access to the devastatingly powerful Ultima spell – with Dragoon, bestowing the abilities to maneuver around the battlefield with Jump and to poke down enemies with short chains of rapid attacks for good damage. It reduces my damage output a bit but the tradeoff in survivability in combat is well worth it for my preferred hit-and-run style. In addition to whatever two jobs you pick for him, Jack also functions as a Blue Mage, meaning that he can absorb certain attack moves with a properly timed Soul Shield and turn them back on the enemy. Absorbing attacks like a bomb’s Fire spell and then throwing it back at them, causing them to self-destruct, is one of the most satisfying moves in Stranger of Paradise. Soul Shield can also be used in rapid succession, and I've managed to parry entire laser beams from bosses like the six-headed dragon Tiamat (one of the four ancient fiends from the original Final Fantasy). Parrying exciting moves like that reminded me of my time with Combat and customization are strong, but Stranger of Paradise’s inventory management system is on the weaker side of things. The good news is that you can sort your Item menu to your heart's content and organize by job, stats, perks, and anything else that appears on a piece of gear. The problem arises once you go to your Equipment menu, which doesn’t have the filter options and simply sorts based on new items, level, affinity, defense, and type of gear. This doesn't sound terrible on paper, but when you have 500 pieces of equipment and are looking for a specific one that has the highest bonus for your two equipped classes, you end up spending a lot of time looking at a menu instead of slashing enemies to score more loot. There is a shortcut to help gear up quickly but it’s not the most effective. Tapping on the touchpad on a character will equip them with all the highest-level gear available that their class can currently use, but it often won’t be beneficial to their specific class. For instance, you may wind up with Mage gear equipped on your tank if it’s the highest level. The menu also restricts your ability to send gear to your stash, effectively locking efficient inventory management to checkpoints in the level. If your bag fills up, you're forced to sift through your inventory to discard the least valuable pieces – that feels very old-school, especially in a co-op game where you don’t want to be waiting around for someone to figure out what to drop.  It’s very common to fill up because while most games with gear scores you spend hours grinding away, hoping to get a new piece of equipment that will work for your build, but Stranger of Paradise does the opposite: it generously showers you with items – roughly 80 to 120 per mission – and it offers specific rewards upon the first completion that are visible before you begin. I can't think of another game that has made loot hunting this efficient from day one. Also, because Stranger of Paradise is hub-based and you will spend most of your time between missions looking at the map, it's simple to forget to dismantle unnecessary gear and accidentally start the next mission with a full backpack. I may have done that once or twice. It began as a collection of the loosest of story ideas that seemed to go nowhere, but slowly but surely Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin pulled it all together and managed to stick the landing – though you’ll want to be sure to scour it for collectibles if you want the full effect of its revelations. A solid and engaging action combat system can be tuned to be as challenging as it is rewarding. Coupled with versatile character customization that lets you mix and match from dozens of interchangeable jobs, your character fights how you see fit and gives the ability to experiment and find a winning combination in single-player or three-player co-op. There’s significant room for improvement in the tools it gives you to manage the avalanche of gear that drops in every mission, but the nods to Final Fantasy history littered throughout its levels are enough to divert attention from that sort of thing. Add in all the extra challenges awaiting after finishing the story, and you will find plenty of content to sink your teeth into that is made even better when you join up with others. "
156,Triangle Strategy ,8.0,"Triangle Strategy starts slowly. Pressing ""New Game"" leads to a series of unappealing events. You're introduced to your character, Serenoa Wolffort, and his extremely boring retainers and fiancee. You're given a bunch of narration about the recent history of a fantasy land whose most interesting characteristic is that there isn't much naturally occurring salt. There's cutscene after cutscene, introducing character after character with almost no context. You barely have to actually do anything, with the exception of a simple intro battle – and that battle system lacks an obvious hook. It's awkward and frustrating with very little other than the marvelous pixel art to keep it motivating. But despite an unappealing start, over the course of its 40-plus hours that slowness becomes a virtue, growing into one of the most effective and entertaining examples of the tactical RPG form.   Don’t worry - this is not one of those “it gets amazing after the first two dozen terrible hours” kinds of JRPGs. Almost every part of that frustrating start fades away, some problems almost immediately, revealing a game whose slow confidence is a virtue. The mundanity of the setting turns into a tense, extremely human political drama. The overwhelming number of characters provides fertile ground for intrigue, as seemingly major characters can be dispatched once the story gets violent, while minor characters step up. It slowly reveals a system where expressing beliefs, gathering information, and understanding character relationships all become important. Combat never becomes overly complex, yet somehow always feels perfectly tuned. And the main character….well, the main character just always makes Jon Snow look exciting by comparison. Sorry about that. The initial impressive standout for Triangle Strategy is its two-dimensional character pixel art that exists in a flexible three-dimensional world. It’s the hallmark of Tomoya Asano, who also worked as a producer on the similarly impressive Octopath Traveler. Being able to zoom in and out and swirl the camera around or tilt from an isometric to a top-down view, all while looking consistent and clear, is a tremendous achievement. It looks good on both TV mode and handheld on the Switch, although I ended up preferring the latter slightly because the characters really popped on the small screen. Likewise, (and also extremely importantly for a word- and number-heavy RPG) I was able to easily read all the text fairly easily both on the Switch itself and on a relatively small television. Game of Thrones in many ways. One the other hand, the four main characters of Triangle Strategy suffer because they are too similarly boring. The young Lord Serenoa, his betrothed Frederica, his advisor Benedict, and his best friend Prince Roland and most other party members are kind, responsible, and excruciatingly, painfully, polite at all times. They don't seem to have any baser instincts and they never swear, lose their temper, express desire, or anything that might seem fun. There are even flashbacks for some of the older characters showing their rowdy youth, and the extent of them is that they sometimes raced in order to see who could follow orders the most efficiently. How rebellious! In a genre filled with flamboyant and memorable characters in games like Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy, or Persona, it's almost shocking to have a set of main characters be so aggressively dull. Yet even this character weakness is mitigated by some of Triangle Strategy's other strengths. First, the plot they participate in ends up stressing them out enough that a personality starts to show through, even if it is still universally positive and responsible – like Frederica's intense need for justice or Roland's love for his family. Bigger than that is the Scales of Conviction system, where whenever House Wolffort faces a major choice, instead of asking us to simply make it through Serenoa, the seven main party members all discuss and vote on it. The votes are binding and can go against your wishes, and as time goes on, they take on more and more importance to both the future of the characters and Norzelia. The higher stakes make the differences in character motivations stand out more, even if they remain – again – excruciatingly polite and rational throughout. There are a few ways to affect the votes. Some small exploration phases allow you to gather information that might prove useful; the knowledge that the Wolffort village is riddled with traps could make inviting an invasion seem more palatable, for instance. Second, dialogue options that match a character's impulses can help: knowing that Benedict is pragmatic means those options are most likely to sway him, while Roland is more focused on loyalty. Finally, based on other choices in dialogue, Sereoa has ""Convictions"" in Utility, Morality, and Liberty stats that can help strengthen his arguments. In one campaign I had generally focused on being kind and honest, which led to difficulties when I wanted to make a choice of whether to play along with a corrupt offer while my retainers all voted to be honest and expose the corruption immediately. The voting and Conviction systems end up being very clever ways to manifest your choices. All the little dialogue decisions you make (and even some actions taken in combat) end up combining to both subtly lead Serenoa down particular paths, and unlock side characters and flashbacks for them. That scrupulous honesty, for example, helped me acquire the honest anti-corruption support character Julio, who proved invaluable in the late game as someone who could keep my mages casting spells with no breaks. On the downside, the Conviction system is masked for the entire first playthrough, which did lead me to some confusion over whether I was supposed to know what was happening or not. (Relaxing and letting the campaign happen as it happens proved to be one of the better ways to play.) The choice system is also deployed well in some crucial ways. For example, one of the seemingly minor setting traits of Triangle Strategy is that it includes an oppressed people called the Roselle, whose historical and religious oppression seemed directly inspired by the history of the Jewish people in a way that was so direct as to feel awkward (real history of real oppressed people being given a slight fantastical mask can lead down some strange and unpleasant paths). But Triangle Strategy consistently gave me the opportunity to take action to make life better for the Roselle when they became relevant. That oppression wasn't mere window dressing to make the world seem darker and more realistic, but instead some created a storytelling opportunity. I still think the Roselle are a little weird, especially the physical trait of pink hair, but they were definitely handled a lot better than I’d feared.  The quiet confidence of Triangle Strategy is even more apparent in the combat system, which initially felt like a perfectly generic tactical RPG. But as the campaign went on it increasingly impressed me with some of the best level design and difficulty tuning I've ever seen in a tactics game. The combat form is similar to Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem: you have a party of eight to 12 characters that you move around a tile-based map in turn. Each character has different skills and stats: Benedict is a supporting class who can use skills that make your characters stronger, tougher, or faster, but does little damage on his own; Roland is a fast-moving cavalryman who can do a lot of damage but doesn't last long if he gets isolated. It's a very traditional form, and one that's stood the test of time because it's an effective way to provide strategic challenges for players while combined with character distinctions and personality shown through actions.  There are small tactical considerations built into the Triangle Strategy system: some enemies take more damage against certain spell types, while taking advantage of the terrain and attacking from higher ground or hitting enemies from behind can do more damage. But these are small features and don't add up to, for example, a combo system like that in Disgaea, where the goal is to create the biggest exploits you possibly can. In Triangle Strategy, the progression system doesn't allow for creating superpowered characters like those in Final Fantasy Tactics. Nor is there anything like Fire Emblem's friendship system to encourage combat choices beyond simply ""do the most damage."" Instead, Triangle Strategy has simpler, quieter progression. Characters get slightly but noticeably stronger in ways that allow some temporary advantages, but then tougher enemies also pick up their own strengths. And while you can't completely reshape your characters, there are enough items and progression choices via weapon upgrades that can tweak them in important ways. As I noticed that Erador, the main heavy infantry character, was starting to take massive magic damage, I upgraded his magic defense and so that he was able to stand my ground more. Meanwhile, every time I thought I found a major advantage – like picking up the powerful archer Archibald – I watched as the enemy forces got strong enough that what I had previously thought was being overpowered became simply another useful strategy.  The tactics genre is one where balancing difficulty is essential, and that's proven demonstrably tough to do. As much as I love both XCOM 2 and Fire Emblem: Three Houses, figuring out what difficulty level I actually want for a consistent challenge was a major frustration for me in both cases. So it's extremely high praise when I say that Triangle Strategy, on the default Normal setting, provided me with exactly the level of difficulty I wanted at almost every turn. When I got stuck on those harder fights, there were interesting and worthwhile optional battles I could engage in to level up a bit, or else I could just experiment with changing my characters’ formation and roster. ""Ah, so if I used the ice mage here, and set my party up on the left instead of meeting the enemy head on, I can survive longer"" are the exact sorts of tactical decisions that I hope to make in games like this.  What's more, the combat system manages to apply that consistent difficulty across multiple level types due to varied and clever level design. In one late-game battle, I was faced with a powerful enemy force headed directly at me – an all-against-all scrum of the sort that tactics games rarely actually try to pull off. I succeeded by loading up on archers and getting them in flanking positions in order to burn down as many enemies as possible, keeping the numbers my melee characters had to deal with manageable. This came right after a battle in a mine, where several mine carts allowed fast movement around the map. That was the complete opposite structure: a series of small group battles where I worked to quickly shuffle support characters around in order to get small advantages that added up to a win. Pixelated Greatness Triangle Strategy also rises to the occasion whenever a major plot battle occurs, both in combat design and also aesthetically. The music – which is so important in this genre – is generally perfectly fine, but in some of the big battle themes it goes above and beyond, particularly with one tune that gives off a spaghetti western vibe. There's also some unique character dialogue that happens during these fights, which is especially useful because the villains tend to carry the campaign in terms of personality. It may not put its best foot forward immediately, but once Triangle Strategy gets going it's shockingly successful at telling a story based on real-world ideas like resource competition and the ambitions of nobles, and those human stories manage to overcome even a massive wet blanket of a main character. It allows for meaningful choices while also including a voting system for party members that can override your desires – based on a groundwork you laid yourself – in fascinating ways. Underlying all of that is its combat, which is simple, well-designed, and appropriately challenging in all the right ways. It may be quiet in its greatness, but that's still great. "
157,Destiny 2: The Witch Queen ,8.0,"The reason I’ve stuck with Destiny for more than seven years, through both its highest highs and lowest lows, has everything to do with its incredibly strong foundation. Even at times when a poorly told story or a lack of content have held it back, firing magical space weapons and throwing flaming hammers at aliens just feels good! And while the past few expansions were adequate but flawed iterations that kept my appetite fed, The Witch Queen feels like a breakthrough that finally realizes the long-running looter shooter’s greatest potential. This latest update provides not only Destiny’s first truly phenomenal story alongside a campaign that’s both challenging and memorable, but also a weapon crafting system that’s a godsend for hardcore devotees like myself, new light-wielding enemies that completely evolve the flow of combat, and new takes on some old abilities to refreshingly shake up the meta. While PvP has still been left in a disappointing lurch, there’s no doubt in my mind that The Witch Queen is otherwise the best Destiny’s ever been. Destiny has always struggled to balance its rich lore between action-packed campaigns and cutscenes, which at times border on the nonsensical, and the item descriptions and “grimoire” lore entries where many of its world’s most important details are squirreled away. Even if you’ve been following the story for a long while, it would be understandable if you have almost no idea what’s actually going on most of the time. But Bungie has spent the last several years changing that, introducing meaningful story developments and characters that feel more three-dimensional than they have in the past. Nowhere is that more apparent than in The Witch Queen which, for the very first time, doesn’t just tell a passable story but an actively compelling one. The star of the show is The Witch Queen herself – Savathûn, the Hive God of Deception – who has succeeded in claiming the almighty power of The Light for herself and her Hive brood. But her story is much more than the usual monster of the week fanfare where we drive a tank through her face and emote on her corpse in glorious fashion. Instead, we get to know her life and motivations, understanding her to be more than a purely evil entity out to destroy us – and as the events unfold, we’re treated to multiple, jaw-dropping twists and turns that make the rollercoaster ride much more enjoyable. There are still a ton of references to characters and lore that make the plot harder to follow if you haven’t been meticulously keeping up with Destiny’s wild escapades (especially the past year in particular), but that’s almost unavoidable at this point and doesn’t stop this story from being entertaining even if you’re playing catchup. The campaign isn’t very long (I was able to get through it in a 24-hour period on the hardest difficulty), but it’s unique, difficult, and more inventive than any Destiny campaign before it – to the point where it’s not even close. The biggest addition is the Become Legend mode, which increases combat difficulty and adds challenging mechanics like limited revives for teammates. For those who would rather not just blow through the campaign immediately, Become Legend serves as a daunting, rewarding adventure that makes Savathûn and her ilk feel like a force to be reckoned with and makes victory in the end that much sweeter, especially since the loot you get out of it is absolutely worth the trouble. My only real complaint as I looted and shooted my way through all The Witch Queen had to offer is that a lot of it is unusually buggy by Destiny’s standards. Whether I was getting kicked to orbit repeatedly during the excellent new raid, staring down sluggish menus on PC, or even experiencing the occasional hard crash on console, I found myself frustrated by bugs and performance issues more often than I’m used to in an MMO that’s usually known for its extreme polish. These problems weren’t just minor quirks either and they especially stood out while attempting the raid, where the challenge is exceptionally high and losing progress because everyone randomly gets disconnected can be downright maddening. The campaign also includes the notable addition of puzzle mechanics to levels and boss fights that have been almost exclusively gated behind raids and Destiny’s endgame content up until this point. Now, instead of just standing on a plate or scanning an artifact before shooting a boss to death, you might have to remember a set of symbols and fight your way through the halls of a palace searching for the door with a matching set before the boss can be damaged. These interactions never approach anything as complex as proper raid mechanics, but instead feel like a perfect entry level for more casual players or those looking for a less sweat-inducing experience. They make all the difference too, because completing the campaign is no longer a matter of mindlessly running and gunning for a handful of hours before credits roll. Now you have to contend with platforming and weird occult magic while dodging fire from some extremely rude baddies. Speaking of baddies, one of the new challenges you’ll face is the fearsome, badass Light-bearing Hive: immortal monsters with many of the same abilities your own character possesses. In fact, they can even be endlessly revived by their Ghost to fight you again and again, which is honestly terrifying. In combat, these Hive Guardians can wield the Light to slam you with devastating supers, many of which can kill you in a single hit. Victory against these formidable foes requires smart gunplay, patience, and most importantly, that you remember to quickly run and crush the enemy Ghost before it can revive them. A challenging new enemy type that forces you to think about how you approach an encounter like this is exactly what Destiny has needed to spruce up combat. Knocking them out then smashing their Ghosts in my hand has been the highlight of my time with The Witch Queen. With so much new content to tackle in The Witch Queen, one thing that’s missing is any sort of improved introduction for new players, which is especially painful considering that this expansion makes an already convoluted world even more complex with systems like weapon crafting. If you don’t already know how to play Destiny 2, the odds of you figuring it out without a very kind and very patient friend as a guide are infinitesimally small. I’d like everyone to enjoy the truly awesome stuff The Witch Queen has to offer, but while it's sure to excite existing Destiny fans, it’s also harder to recommend it to the uninitiated in its current state. Once you’re done with the campaign, there’s a whole new area to explore in Savathûn’s Throne World, a pocket dimension that’s a magical, otherworldly representation of her mind. The Patrol Zone is fairly similar to things we’ve already seen before in Destiny, but it does have my new favorite character: Fynch, a Hive Ghost who betrays his own to help you save the day. This sassy little conscientious objector serves as your guide through much of The Witch Queen’s action and is absolutely brimming with memorable one-liners in one of the best voice performances Destiny has enjoyed. It makes exploring the Hive God’s mind a lot more enjoyable, even when you’re running the usual chores like Patrols and Lost Sectors. The Witch Queen also has plenty of challenging post-campaign endgame quests and multiplayer activities, some which have their own cutscenes or flesh out the story in one way or another. Exotic quests, for example, are difficult, miniature adventures that end in you acquiring some crazy new toy like a grenade launcher that shoots exploding worm Gods. There’s plenty to do for those hungry for more once credits roll on the campaign and lots of new weapons and armor to grind endlessly for if you’re into that sort of thing. As with previous Destiny expansions, The Witch Queen campaign directly ties into the grindy seasonal content that was kicked off alongside it: Season of the Risen. This ongoing content includes weekly story quests, activities, and loot to tempt you into coming back for more drama and explosions. The Psiops Battlegrounds seasonal activity is your usual matchmade fanfare where you’re expected to repeatedly complete the same mini story mission as you unlock new gear and perks while being drip-fed bits of dialogue. Season of the Risen may or may not be included depending on which version of The Witch Queen you purchase, so it’s not a part of the proper expansion and not something worth your time unless you’re very invested in the ongoing epic, but it offers plenty for hardcore players to chase – besides, it’s always nice to see Destiny’s momentum continue on long after the campaign is done and dusted by much of the community. But when it comes to endgame content, as usual, the raid is king, once again pitting six players against some of the toughest challenges to be found in any game. This year’s raid is called Vow of the Disciple and it takes place in a bizarre alien museum filled with grotesque statues and pieces of preserved living tissue, apparently put on display there by the galaxy’s most disturbed hoarder. The trials within are enigmatic puzzles that require powerful gear, incredible teamwork, and fast reaction times to overcome, and it’s some of the most fun The Witch Queen offers for those brave enough to tackle it. More importantly though, Vow of the Disciple also does some serious heavy-lifting in terms of storytelling and setting up future events still to come in Destiny – something few other raids have done so far. Without going into spoilers, I’ll just say it’s absolutely worth climbing the mountain for those interested in seeing what lies beyond the horizon – even if the challenge of getting there may make you like your friends less as a result. Of all the new frontiers The Witch Queen offers though, none are so enticing as the long-awaited weapon crafting feature, which is a joyous windfall for RPG nerds like myself. Now, instead of relentlessly grinding the same activities over and over in hopes of getting that perfect weapon with all the right perks you were looking for, you can simply craft it to your exact specifications. There are a few caveats, though. First, doing so is every bit as needlessly complex as you might expect from Destiny, forcing you to juggle a bunch of new, confusingly named currencies in a process so hilariously dense you’ll get whiplash coming at it straight from the fast-paced battlefield. And second, building your perfect weapon requires (wait for it) a whole lot of grinding! That’s right – the new system that lets you avoid the grind for the perfect weapon is replaced by a different grind to level up a mediocre weapon until it’s powerful enough to be crafted into its final form. The good news is now you at least always know there will be a definitive and predictable end to the grind instead of playing endlessly hoping RNG will be kind to you, but killing thousands of enemies and completing dozens of activities just to level up a single weapon is still quite a climb. The weapon crafting system also impacts just about every aspect of how you’ll play Destiny going forward, in that now you’ll likely be using less-than-ideal weapons in order to level up ones you’d like to fine tune via crafting. And since one of the ways you gain the resources necessary for crafting is by using randomly dropped (and usually bad) weapons until you fill up a progress bar, my loadout was usually a bizarre mish-mash of weapons in their awkward puberty stage before they become useful for the endgame. That injects a bit of amusing variety into the day-to-day grind, but also means you’re rarely using weapons you fully enjoy for most of the time you’re working your way through the expansion. One entirely welcome addition in The Witch Queen is a new weapon archetype called the glaive, which is a polearm that can be used to block incoming fire, attack enemies in melee range, and fire projectiles to hit others from a distance. It’s been a few years since Destiny got a proper new weapon type and this one shakes things up in a big way as the first melee/ranged hybrid option, but this experiment is a glowing success. Glaives are a lot of fun to use, play a major role in the Destiny weapons ecosystem, and don’t feel overpowered at the moment (until someone inevitably devises a completely broken build to exploit them, as is tradition at this point). The other major sandbox change is Void 3.0, an overhaul of one of the four power types guardians can choose from. After Stasis abilities were introduced with Beyond Light in 2020, the legacy abilities of Void, Arc, and Solar have all felt out of balance by comparison – and at times even completely unviable. Void 3.0 is an attempt to fix that in part by bringing one of the other ability groups into parity with Stasis. The new customization options completely changed the way I thought about my Void abilities and have the much-needed benefit of making it so my guardian doesn’t play identically to every other guardian at my side. Now two characters using the same subclass might be equipped with two entirely different super abilities, grenades, and perks that fundamentally change how they operate, which mixes things up for the better in PvE and PvP alike. The downside is that it’s only a partial fix, as the two other subclasses (Arc and Solar) remain very much in the dust. Seeing them in the wild has been a rarity in the days following The Witch Queen’s release. Bungie has said it plans to bring the other subclasses into parity over the next year or so, but in the meantime the meta remains very much imbalanced in a way that discourages you from using half of the abilities on offer. And that’s a trend that arises quite frequently when playing The Witch Queen. While just about every inch of the content added does everything right, its shortcomings are instead defined by what isn’t there. That’s embodied perfectly by the complete lack of additions both to Destiny’s PvP modes and the PvE/PvP hybrid mode Gambit. Once you step out of the excellent campaign and new content around it, which you’ll almost certainly need to do during the grind to the endgame, you’ll find that absolutely nothing has been added to Crucible – no new game modes and not a single map. This isn’t a new trend either as Bungie has largely left their PvP options rotting on the vine, even removing a whopping eleven maps from their playlists without replacing them and going on almost two years without adding a new one. Similarly, Gambit has had its maps reduced to just four, and only minor changes have been made to it over the years despite it being easily the least enjoyable mode Destiny has. We used to expect Crucible maps and the occasional game mode to be added with each major content release, but The Witch Queen is yet another expansion that largely ignores the issues. It’s getting harder to overlook that when Crucible and Gambit are stood up as such large cornerstones of what players are expected to do. Destiny 2 is a blast out of the gate thanks to its excellent co-op shooter gameplay and strong storytelling in the campaign. Not all the features I’d expected to find are here, but it does deliver the same kind of highly social gameplay and rewarding, loot-driven progression that helped the original keep me hooked for hundreds of hours. The main concerns right now are a few bugs and lack of event options, but I’ll definitely be sticking around to see this big, action-packed universe develop over time. "
158,Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn of Ragnarok DLC ,8.0,"I really wanted to love Dawn of Ragnarok. On paper its premise of delving into Norse mythology is a promise to truly investigate one of the most interesting loose ends left by Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s story that would give Eivor the power of the gods. In disappointing reality, it's a mostly unchanged stretch of gameplay dressed up like a magical romp through the Nine Realms. Replacing European kings with giants and dwarves doesn’t change the fact that all of the moment-to-moment adventuring, looting, and combat is exactly the same as it has been in the roughly 150 hours of Valhalla that preceded it. How do you add a whole new set of supernatural abilities and without making anything feel new or different? Like the two DLC expansions before it, it’s not a letdown of Asgardian proportions, but it is a letdown nonetheless.   Dawn of Ragnarok, the third DLC expansion, channels Christopher Nolan’s Inception and goes deeper as Eivor – themselves a virtual reconstruction of an ancient viking – uses trippy drugs to relive the spiritual reconstruction of the life of their culture’s gods in order to sort out their own existential dread. This Assassin-ception idea was a clever metaphor during the main game, with Odin whispering increasingly paranoid advice into Eivor’s ear every time a new and more bizarre revelation is made about the truth of their world, but the story is far less poetic here. It’s more a straightforward tale of Havi’s (read: Odin’s) quest to save his son Baldur from the fire demon Surtur. It’s a story that is largely standard fare for this series, and especially the Vahallaverse. The characters are well realized and nuanced. Surtur, his children, and his wife all stand as enemies in the way of your ultimate end, but they all have their own motivations and sometimes complicated relationships with one another that make them all seem more relatable than your bog-standard cackling bad guy. Svarfenheim’s original residents, the dwarves, are as varied in demeanor and opinion as should be expected from a group of people whose country is occupied by not one, but two factions of colonizing giants: some want to fight, some want to keep their heads down and survive. Everyone has their own opinion on what the presence of the All-Father means for them, and I found chatting up the locals to figure that out to be entertaining if nothing else. Svarfenheim is filled to the brim with environments fit for ancient legend. Much of the land looks as verdant and beautiful as many locations in England, Norway, or Ireland. It almost has a Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings sort of vibe, where everything looks like a postcard of some natural landscapes that exist in the real world (ie New Zealand), with the occasional enormous dwarven statue or gigantic mountain made of solid gold. Things do get occasionally weirder when you start seeing enormous stones floating in the air or some burning tree root tentacle-thing crawling across the sky. The result is a serene but occasionally chaotic landscape that succeeds in feeling unique among the miles and miles of land Eivor has traveled to this point. Disappointingly, you’ll be doing largely the same things you've been doing for a year and a half now (yes, Valhalla came out in November of 2020) across the regions of Svarfenheim. Checking off map objectives by finding treasure and mysterious landmarks are made no different by being the God of Gods. New light-based puzzles are few and far between. World Events return from the base game, but they remain bite-sized versions of side quests that are inconsistent in quality and in compensation for completion. There are new collectibles to find, new elites to hunt, too, but the process of completing those tasks is all the same as ever. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is a big, bold, and ridiculously beautiful entry to the series that finally delivers on the much-requested era of the Viking and the messy, political melting pot of England’s Dark Ages. It walks a fine line between historical tourism, top-shelf conspiracy theory, and veiled mysticism against the backdrop of a grounded and focused story. Fresh takes on several of the series’ established loot and quest systems help to keep the things fluid and nuanced, though progression could use refinement. There’s also a bigger than usual horde of bugs and blemishes to contend with from start to finish. But while it may not be the most stylish or polished, its rugged and brutal look at the muddy business of Scandanavian expansion is as memorable and dense as an Assassin’s Creed has ever been, and it makes great use of the new consoles. The biggest and best new feature of Dawn of Ragnarok is the new Hugr-Rip, a magical bracer that lets you steal powers from certain enemies and use them as your own. This includes giving yourself fire or frost giant powers for a limited period of time, making you resistant to specific elements and allowing you to take a dip in lava flows without burning to a crisp, for instance. It also allows you to disguise yourself as the enemy to infiltrate camps, but I found that novelty wore off rather quickly, as it is really only interesting when the campaign makes you do it, and largely more of a hassle then your normal threat-removal strategies. My favorite power came from a lowly raven, and it allows Eivor to transform into a bird themselves and fly across the world or to reach a tactically advantageous position without having to tiptoe among the enemy. This mostly just serves to cut out the traditional travel time, though. What was really underwhelming was the limitations of these powers. You can only have two active at any one time, and you can’t just select the ones you want from a list to have equipped. If you want to change your active abilities, you have to find an enemy in the world who has it and take it from them. For something like a disguise power they tend to be well placed and abundant, but all of the others feel sporadic and hard to rely on. So even though a power that revives slain enemies to fight for you is great fun to use, in practice I rarely found myself going out of my way to find a poor sap to slay for it in preparation for future challenges. I use “challenges” lightly because you won’t find too many in Dawn of Ragnarok. Boss fights offer a bit of pushback which the normal rank-and-file enemies lack, but that's mostly thanks to some special mechanic or pattern you have to adhere to. You see the depth of the new roster of enemy types pretty early in the 20 hours it takes to more or less exhaust this DLC’s reserves, and there aren’t many examples of campaign encounters that put all of their strengths to great use. They’re almost all just enemies you’ve seen before, but with blue and black skin. The few that are truly new, like Flamekeepers who can bring their fallen allies back to life, are pretty easy to dispatch. Around the end of your journey, Kara’s Arena will open up, that will provide battle encounters that will be the test that combat enthusiasts crave. Besides throwing waves on enemies both mundane and epic at you, you can turn up the heat by adding boasts - modifiers that add stipulations to the fight like making each consecutive melee attack do less damage unless you weave in ranged attacks. Too bad this all comes so late in the game. A new weapon type, the Atgeir, tries to spice combat up a bit, allowing you to piece your own short combos together by mixing light and heavy attacks to your heart’s content. The wide-arcing swipes are perfect for crowd control, but I didn’t feel like I was really expressing any creativity in mashing these buttons, in the way more sophisticated action titles like Devil May Cry might. It isn't the offensive game-changer the scythe was in Siege of Paris, but it’s fun nonetheless. You can upgrade gear to a new Divine level as well, which allows you to slot a new type of rune in them, but as with all the other micromanaging you can do with the equipment in this game, you can go a whole playthrough without feeling their impact. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is a big, bold, and ridiculously beautiful entry to the series that finally delivers on the much-requested era of the Viking and the messy, political melting pot of England’s Dark Ages. It walks a fine line between historical tourism, top-shelf conspiracy theory, and veiled mysticism against the backdrop of a grounded and focused story. Fresh takes on several of the series’ established loot and quest systems help to keep the things fluid and nuanced, though progression could use refinement.

"
159,Gran Turismo 7 ,9.0,"From the first honk of the series’ iconic countdown klaxon, there are moments during Gran Turismo 7 when it feels almost like a remake of the 1997 original. In the space of a moment I’m 16 again and stuffing earthshaking turbos into a bright red Mitsubishi GTO, wondering how I’m going to be able to beat my dad around Trial Mountain when he always gets the DualShock and I have to make do with our only other controller – a terrible, translucent blue aftermarket job with no analogue sticks. That’s a kind of magic a video game series can’t buy; it can only earn. Gran Turismo 7 has that magic; that compulsive car upgrade loop the series established, plus the hot looks and sterling handling to back it up. But there’s a lot more to Gran Turismo 7 than the sum of its nostalgia – even if there are still a few traditions it should’ve left in its rear-view mirror. Nostalgia isn’t a requirement, though: Gran Turismo 7 is the most welcoming GT ever, with dozens of hours of curated races and tasks designed to induct a new generation of players into the classic GT experience. GT7 achieves this via the Gran Turismo Café, an eccentric but effective little hub that the developers at Polyphony have placed right in the middle of its world map. When we drop in, the café owner assigns us specific races and tasks via a series of 39 so-called “menu books.” Working through those gradually introduces new drivers to how things work in GT – from earning licences and finding and buying cars, to customisation and racing. Some of it may initially seem like busywork to long-time GT players, but the racing events the Gran Turismo Café deliberately threads us through all make up part of the large list of career races we’d be otherwise doing anyhow – and the decent collection of reward cars offered for working through the menu books makes it well worth your time.  You’ll definitely be able to win many more cars this way than you’d be able to afford to buy in your first week with GT7, that much is clear. Payouts aren’t particularly extravagant and car upgrade costs can be surprisingly high for some items, like tyres that cost twice as much as an entire MX-5, or $100,000 nitrous systems no amount of boosted DVD players would ever pay for. Even neat ideas, like the huge range of official manufacturer paint colours we can use in the design booth, annoyingly come with a cost attached. Gran Turismo 7 features the shady ability to top-up your in-game credit balance with real money via the PlayStation Store. At the time of publish the link to do so directly from the various purchase screens in-game is not functioning, so we're unable to see how much credits cost. It would seem that this is a different approach to the microtransactions added to GT Sport in 2018 (which was around a year after it was reported it would not feature microtransactions). The microtransactions added to GT Sport allowed cars to be directly purchased a la carte for real money; GT7 appears to be a cash-for-credits scheme. Either way, GT7's microtransactions have me feeling a bit cynical overall, especially considering how hard GT7 leans into making some of its coolest cars artificially scarce. Some rare cars will only pop up occasionally to buy before they're ""sold out"", and others require peculiar, time-limited, in-game invitations to actually purchase. It's easy to see how the fear of missing out may coax some players who are light on credits to shell out real cash to grab certain cars before they disappear again. Nevertheless, collecting each themed trio of cars for the GT Café’s menu books (like European classic compacts, or retro Japanese sports icons) also unlocks a sweetly earnest short video that showcases the cars and explains their relevance to automotive culture. These vignettes are clearly aimed at people with a more limited background in motoring history than I have but I still admire Polyphony’s efforts to try and add context to why certain cars are here. That said, while some of these collections are very historically robust and can properly chart the lineage of certain iconic models, some others are hamstrung by GT7’s limited pool of cars to pull from. For instance, GT7’s Supra and GT-R collections are great examples of menu books that span decades of motoring evolution, but others have to take a bit more of a grab-bag approach. GT7’s car roster exceeding 400 sounds good on paper (and it surpasses the nearly 350 that 2017’s GT Sport ended up with after several years of updates) but accounting for multiple variations of the fantasy Vision GT cars, the race car versions of road cars, and then the reverse “road car” versions of some of those race cars, that 400 figure shrinks a bit. It’s really only around half the cars available in Forza Motorsport 7, the crosstown rival racer it originally inspired. The reality is the garage in GT7 is not nearly as rich as you may expect – and certainly not as current. With a few exceptions, most manufacturers’ ranges tend to top out at around 2017. If you’re expecting to see quite a few high-profile cars from the last two or three years here, like the latest McLarens or any Tesla built since 2012, you may be disappointed. Crucially, however, the car handling is quite impeccable – and virtually every single car I’ve driven feels appreciably different from the last. Retro road cars feel lairy and loose, and they can become wilder still with some extra oomph squeezed under the bonnet as proper performance tuning returns to the series after its absence from GT Sport. Modern sports cars feel a bit more planted but they’re nothing like the dedicated race models, which are stiff and cling to the tarmac like their tyres have talons. In what feels like an improvement on GT Sport, grip doesn’t quite disappear off a cliff the moment I overcook a corner exit. I’ve found I’m able to drive out of trouble more often after perching a car in a slide. I have my reservations about the off-road handling – specifically how it deals with jumps – but GT7 is amazing on asphalt. Like GT Sport before it GT7 seriously sings on a steering wheel (I’m using the Thrustmaster T-GT) but know that it still feels absolutely at home on a DualSense controller, and I haven’t felt like it’s a disadvantage; in fact, I’ve achieved gold cups in the bulk of the license tests using a controller. I have found the weaker of the two countersteering assists useful in some vehicles because it takes some of the dramatic edge off my car’s bulk snapping from side to side – something that can be a little tricky to intuit with only the tiny amount of travel possible on an analogue stick compared to a wheel – but if you require more assists GT7 features plenty of them, all the way up to full auto-braking. GT7 may be a serious racer, but it’s not an entirely inaccessible one. Gran Turismo Sport is a very well-crafted online racing destination. It’s serious, sensible, structured, and – unlike Sony’s previous first-party racing game, DriveClub – it’s been reliable since launch. It’s also supremely good-looking, well-presented, and handles great. However, the hard pivot to an online-focused racing sim has seen it lose a slab of its single-player mode, it lacks meaningful weather effects, and its garage and track selection is startlingly stingy next to the competition. The PS5 DualSense’s haptic feedback also rates a positive mention. There are times where it feels like it’s trying to deliver a few too many sensations simultaneously to really grasp what each is trying to illustrate – so it’s just a lot of whirring and buzzing, all at once – but the DualSense otherwise copes with GT7 splendidly. The response to curbs is particularly nuanced, and there are some other bits of feedback that are unique to particular tracks that feels very cool – like the whirr from whipping over the metal grates that stretch across the Tokyo expressway circuit. That this buzz feels distinct in my hands from the clunk of a gear change is exactly the type of thing I’m keen to keep seeing done with the DualSense. However, it remains a shame that Polyphony keeps compromising its high-quality driving by persisting with frustrating rolling starts for career mode events, repeating the same mistake GT6 made. In a real-life motor race, cars cruise closely in two rows for rolling starts. But in GT7 career races, the cars are arranged in single file, 50-odd metres apart, and we are always placed in last. In a race with 20 opponents at Mount Panorama, this means the leader is already all the way up Mountain Straight and approaching the Cutting by the time we cross the starting line. In simple terms, that’s well over a kilometre away. These ridiculous head starts mean career events are less a race than they are a chase. We’re not dogfighting for track position with backmarkers; we’re simply blazing past them trying to negate the immense starting deficit. The racing really just amounts to an overtaking challenge, which GT7 already officially has a bunch of in its addictive set of driving mission challenges. What’s mystifying is that GT7 has a great and extremely granular custom race creator that features grid starts so we know there’s no technical reason not to have them. It just… doesn’t use them where they’d work best. Starting out in GT7 on PS5 you’ll be offered the choice between two graphics modes: a performance mode that prioritises the frame rate at all times, and a ray tracing mode that applies ray tracing to certain non-gameplay scenarios (you can switch between them at any time). Ray tracing can be active in things like the photo mode, replays, and the garage, but I honestly don’t feel the juice is worth the squeeze. With ray tracing on the camera tends to jitter a bit when panning across interiors, and I actually think the cars tend to look sharper and better without it. In fact, GT7’s greatest lighting victory has little to do with its ray tracing mode at all: its fantastic time-of-day effects bathe the fabulous set of circuits in supremely realistic and always-changing light. Watching as the crisp afternoon sun gave way to the pink and purple hues of dusk atop Mount Panorama I was seriously impressed; it’s distractingly good. GT7’s dynamic time-of-day and weather effects aren’t a genre first but they have finally pushed its tracks to the next level – and they’re doubly cool when applied to returning original GT circuits like High Speed Ring, Deep Forest, and fan favourite Trial Mountain. It's just a great-looking package all around, really. I quite like the smaller details, from the way the pit crews clamber up fences to pump their fists and wave flags on the last lap in championship races to the way tow hooks, decals, and unique aero parts begin to naturally appear on tuned AI opponents as you move up through the competition ranks. Those aero parts are the result of a neat wing editor that allows us to select from different end plates and wing heights rather than make do with a small handful of presets, and they’re just one of a bunch of innovations hidden in GT7’s cosmetic and performance customisation. I’m a real fan of the straightforward detuning that’s now possible in the settings screen; it’s now much easier to keep your most-loved cars on track when performance limits fluctuate between events by simply adding ballast or turning down the engine computer (rather than heading back to the garage to strip off parts to make something race legal). While the Gran Turismo Café is a clever experiment that works, GT7’s new music features – which were a large focus of February’s extensive GT7 reveal – feel like a bust. They’re both let down by an ostensibly large music library that ranges from mostly forgettable to outright weird. The Music Replay feature works as advertised – and I understand that the race replay cameras are being generated around the track dynamically depending on how fast my car is travelling and switching in time with the music – but the effect isn’t particularly seismic or stirring. Music Rally, an arcade-style mode where we start with a certain number of beats which tick down as a song plays and need to be topped up by passing through extension gates, has turned out to be a particularly odd focus. “Quirky” is the polite way to describe it, but “baffling” is probably the more accurate. It’s admittedly hard for me to gauge how a 2022 audience will respond to hustling around a track to classical disco megamixes from 1982, but personally I’m confused as hell here. Most disappointingly, for a series with a baked-in history of associated music tracks that are seared into the minds of millions, this wasn’t the direction Polyphony went with Music Rally. It gets frustratingly close, with one of the songs in Music Rally plucked from the opening movie to the PAL version of GT5 Prologue on PS3, but that’s it. A Music Rally mode stacked with songs from the heyday of Gran Turismo, like My Favourite Game by The Cardigans, The Chemical Brothers remix of Everything Must Go, or any of the Ash, Feeder, and Lenny Kravitz tunes that made up those early intro movies and soundtracks? That would have been a very clever hook. As it stands, though, the six currently available Music Rally events are mostly a bit bizarre and boring. Even more confusingly, it’s one of only two modes that function offline. Like GT Sport before it, everything else in the single-player mode (except an arcade mode with a tiny selection of cars) requires an online connection. That you can’t access online multiplayer in this case is obviously a given, but the fact you can’t even access the two-player mode offline has me stumped. That needless connectivity isn’t as big a problem for most people in 2022 as it was a few years back but it’s still something to be aware of. While the PvP online component was really the crux of GT Sport, GT7 doesn’t emphasise it in quite the same way, letting the single-player campaign flex its muscles. With rotating, scheduled racing and championships, Sport mode in GT7 still functions the same as it does in GT Sport, though, so I fully expect it’ll be a similarly strong online racing venue. GT7 also adds some more low-stakes multiplayer options, including lobbies where players can meet up on most of the circuits, tool around with no specific race settings, and just chat, compare cars, and cruise. These may descend into bedlam following GT7’s launch, but I think the idea is sound. On the eve of the series’ 25th birthday, Gran Turismo 7 is more than just a celebration of cars this time around; in some ways, it’s also a celebration of itself. A modern mix of the original Gran Turismo’s trendsetting format with GT Sport’s stern but very successful focus on competitive online racing, this version is a potent podium performance from developer Polyphony Digital. With gorgeous graphics, a fantastic driving feel, and racing options galore, it’s the best the series has been since its dominant PlayStation 2 era. It does have some significant failings, though, including how it continues to cripple its career mode races with dreadfully flawed rolling starts, its car list is no longer as comprehensive as the competition, and its always-online single-player mode still seems needlessly punitive. But all of that is on the periphery of GT7’s outstanding driving experiences, which are enhanced by the PS5’s gorgeous graphics and intense and flavourful haptic feedback via the DualSense controller. "
160,Shadow Warrior 3 ,7.0,"Shadow Warrior 3 doesn’t beat around the bush. In an era where games feel like they keep trying to be bigger, this one is happy not to draw itself out with lengthy dialogue or exposition-filled cutscenes. Instead, it throws you into the action right away and rarely lets a moment of ease set in from there. And while that focus on fun is refreshing, Shadow Warrior 3 is almost completely unremarkable in its execution, being about as straightforward as an FPS can get. It might not offer many new ideas, and its protagonist may be unbearable to listen to, but sometimes solid movement and satisfying weapons is all you really need. Picking up a good while after Shadow Warrior 2, a massive dragon is wreaking havoc across Earth and it’s up to our returning hero, Lo Wang, to destroy the lizard. For Shadow Warrior, world-ending stakes like these aren’t anything new, but it didn’t take long for me to stop paying too much attention to Shadow Warrior 3’s story. Once you start playing it you might do the same, because it's generally a rushed load of nonsense. But you don’t play Shadow Warrior for the story – you play it to shoot demons, and there’s certainly plenty of shooting to do.  From the get-go, Shadow Warrior 3 makes clear that it wants to be exciting more than anything else. Its very first fights take place on the back of that Earth-threatening dragon, which you run and jump across like an action movie hero. It generally doesn’t slow down from there either, and that breakneck pace is probably for the best. If you were given the opportunity to stop and think about what was happening, you might end up asking questions like “how did Lo Wang survive in a ramshackle shack on top of a mountain?” or “why did this dragon get so big when it was so much smaller at the end of Shadow Warrior 2?” Killing demons keeps all of those pesky thoughts about the nonsensical story away. Shadow Warrior 3 takes the same exciting approach as Doom Eternal or Titanfall 2, emphasizing speed and maneuverability above all else. Lo Wang moves lightning fast, able to double jump high above the heads of enemies or quickly dash away from their attacks. Every arena you fight in is built around these movement mechanics, turning battles into wonderfully frantic flurries of gunshots and katana swipes. In between killing demons, Shadow Warrior 3 generally only gives you one thing to do: run to the next arena full of demons. The platforming sections that separate each fight never last very long or get too complicated, and exploration during those stretches isn’t really a thing. You can occasionally go off the beaten trail to find upgrades that improve Lo Wang’s weapons and abilities lightly (effects like increasing ammo or making certain attacks drop more resources), but outside of those few instances you’re only ever fighting or making your way toward another fight. Developer Flying Wild Hog’s approach to Shadow Warrior 3’s linear campaign is simple but effective. It gets to the point, and as a result felt more respectful of my time across the roughly four-and-a-half hours it took me to reach the credits than any other game I’ve played recently. That also means it’s not a very complex or robust FPS, but I always knew that all I had to do was keep moving forward if I wanted more action. What’s an absolute shame is that Shadow Warrior 3 spends so much time looking forward that it doesn’t give you a chance to go back. Without an option to revisit levels, any upgrades you might have missed along the way are simply gone. Thankfully, these collectibles aren’t hard to spot, and you’ll get enough of them without exploring to easily finish the campaign. But it’s too bad that missing one means you’ll have to wait until a second playthrough if you want to completely kit out Lo Wang’s arsenal of gear and powers. When it comes to actually killing hordes of demons, Shadow Warrior 3 isn’t doing anything too unique. In fact, it follows the standard FPS playbook in pretty much every way I can think of. You can shoot an enemy and chunks of them blow off in gruesome fashion, something that’s been normalized in FPS games since 2016’s Doom did it so well. You can zoom around combat arenas without a problem, but mixing platforming into the regular shoot-em-up fare isn’t exactly a new idea either. It’s not that Shadow Warrior 3 is doing any of this poorly, it’s just not nearly as exciting when I’ve seen all its tricks before. Each of the six weapons are satisfying to use, from the starting six-shooter pistol to options you’ll eventually unlock like the single-fire railgun and the shuriken launcher. Each one feels punchy, and seeing how enemies react to their hits makes them that much more fun to shoot. That said, with such a small list of weapons and no alternate fire modes, a few of them inevitably got stale. Upgrades do remedy that just a bit, changing how some weapons behave, but none of them are overhauled entirely. Instead, weapon upgrades hand out extra ammo capacity or other small tweaks – one that I found particularly useful slowed down time whenever I charged a shot with the railgun. They’re fun, simple additions that make weapons more powerful, but they won’t change how you think about using them. To keep weapons from getting old too quickly, Shadow Warrior 3 often restricts ammo to force you to switch around your strategy. While ammo can be found on the ground in most arenas, those stockpiles will eventually run dry during a fight, and after that the only way to get more is to kill enemies with your katana. Running low on health incentivizes the opposite, encouraging you to gun down enemies in a bid for health pickups. Doom’s own strategy of chainsawing enemies in half to get a burst of ammo and health is a clear inspiration here, but Shadow Warrior 3 turns it into a steady drip of supplies instead of a concentrated explosion. Outside of guaranteeing you never entirely run out of ammo or health pick-ups, this system cleverly ensures that you’ll use every weapon that Shadow Warrior 3 has to offer. You’re not going to survive by only shooting or only stabbing, and instead have to use a mixture of both in order to reap all the potential rewards. Holding resources hostage like this is somewhat heavy-handed, but it ended up being a fun way to keep me on my toes and pushed me to change up my approach often, even if it meant swinging at a massive demon with a comparably tiny sword. Gore weapons can mix up this system, but only a bit. After performing a finisher on an enemy, Lo Wang will rip a new weapon or buff out of them – flying shogun heads that shoot lasers, for example, can be ripped apart and turned into a grenade that spews lasers like a disco ball. While that may sound like it expands your arsenal beyond the six regular options on paper, I never found Gore weapons to be tremendously useful in practice. They’re a welcome quirk on top of Shadow Warrior 3’s otherwise vanilla gameplay, just not one you can always rely on. Instead what kept me interested in the combat during my short time with Shadow Warrior 3 was, once again, its pace. The campaign would give me new weapons just as I was hoping another would be added to my arsenal, and it wraps up levels as soon as they’re about to overstay their welcome. In fact, the only part of Shadow Warrior 3 that I actively hoped would stop was how much Lo Wang talked. Shadow Warrior has a reputation for stupid humor, and this one continues that attitude in earnest, almost as if it’s proud to wear the “our character’s name is still a penis joke” badge. Hearing Lo Wang quip away after killing demons eventually gets tiring. Shadow Warrior 3 does such a great job at keeping needless dialogue out of the picture, but couldn’t seem to do the same for the jokes that fly out of its main character’s mouth. Two hours into Shadow Warrior 3, I felt as though I had heard all of Lo Wang’s jokes and puns already, which only made them grow more irritating as they began to repeat.  Shadow Warrior 3 provides some good old-fashioned FPS action, even if it isn’t doing anything particularly special within the genre. Its forgettable story gets almost entirely out of the way of its blisteringly fast combat, chock full of enemies that are fun to shoot up through largely familiar methods. It doesn’t take many risks to help it stand out, but Shadow Warrior 3's quick campaign is still a gory and enjoyable gauntlet while it lasts. "
161,Elden Ring ,10.0,"In the 87 hours that it took me to beat Elden Ring, I was put through an absolute wringer of emotion: Anger as I was beaten down by its toughest challenges, exhilaration when I finally overcame them, and a fair amount of sorrow for the mountains of exp I lost along the way to some of the toughest boss encounters FromSoftware has ever conceived. But more than anything else I was in near-constant awe – from the many absolutely jaw-dropping vistas, the sheer scope of an absolutely enormous world, the frequently harrowing enemies, and the way in which Elden Ring nearly always rewarded my curiosity with either an interesting encounter, a valuable reward, or something even greater. FromSoftware takes the ball that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild got rolling and runs with it, creating a fascinating and dense open world about freedom and exploration above all else, while also somehow managing to seamlessly weave a full-on Dark Souls game into the middle of it. It shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone that Elden Ring ended up as one of the most unforgettable gaming experiences I’ve ever had. To set the stage, all you know from the outset is that you play as a “Tarnished” of no renown, blessed by grace, and are compelled to make the journey to The Lands Between and become an Elden Lord. What that actually means, how one might go about doing that, and what the deal is with that giant glowing golden tree are all things that you have to discover yourself. Like other FromSoft games, the grand story is hard to fully digest on a first playthrough, especially because there’s no in-game journal to refresh you on the events, characters, or unique terms you encounter across dozens of hours. There really should be, but it is a story I nonetheless enjoyed trying to piece together for myself. I look forward to supplementing that knowledge with the inevitable painstakingly detailed lore videos that emerge from the community later.  It ended up being the organic side stories that kept me most enthralled rather than the grand overarching plot that credits Game of Thrones’ George R.R. Martin as its scenario writer. FromSoft smartly doesn’t change much in its approach to these from the Souls games, Bloodborne, or Sekiro; you’ll just naturally meet characters as you explore and discover the world and become involved in their problems. There are no “!” markers on the map, no waypoints to guide you to them, and these characters don’t always flag you down or initially want or need anything from you. They’re just people with their own agendas and goals, whose stories are impacted based on your own actions or inactions. That was actually kind of refreshing in an open world as vast as this one, and it was always exciting to see a familiar face pop up again later as I was eager to learn about what brought them to this new part of the world and how their journey had progressed. The trade-off, of course, is that without any markers, quest log, or journal, it becomes very easy to forget about certain plot threads and accidentally leave them unresolved by the end. That’s a bummer, and I’ve already felt regret at missing out on stories that some of my colleagues have had – but for me it was worth it, because even after 87 hours, I never once felt the open-world fatigue that usually sets in when my brain gets overloaded by a map absolutely full of unresolved sidequest markers. Besides, any missed quests give me extra incentive to continue onto New Game+.  “Freedom” is the word that every aspect of Elden Ring’s design connects back to. From the moment you set foot in Limgrave, the first of many interconnected regions of The Lands Between, you are completely free to go wherever you want. And sure, that’s far from a new concept in open-world games, but the way it's handled here is truly extraordinary. If you wanted to, you could be an explorer and spend hours upon hours in Limgrave, delving into every mini dungeon, fighting every boss, discovering every NPC, and leveling yourself up to better prepare for what’s next. Alternatively, you could follow the Light of Grace, guiding you toward the main path and the first major dungeon – or you could find a hidden path to a new region that’s meant for higher levels and completely bypass the first major dungeon entirely! Maybe even steal yourself a cool weapon early while you’re there. Again, this is not unprecedented, but a few things set Elden Ring apart from games like Skyrim that provide a similar openness. For one, Elden Ring doesn’t scale enemy levels to match your own at all, so jumping into a later region means you’re always dealing with stronger enemies, making the risk/reward prospect of doing so very real. But perhaps more notably, the way its different areas are connected makes finding these new ones more than a simple matter of choosing a direction and heading towards it. Limgrave is designed very specifically with a main path in mind that takes you through Stormveil Castle, and finding a way around that truly feels like you’ve discovered a hidden passage or alternate route, which is a super cool feeling not present in most open worlds I’ve explored. You also have more freedom in how you approach combat than any previous FromSoft game thanks to a bunch of familiar new systems that are used in interesting ways here. Stealth is a more viable option thanks to the addition of crouch-walking, which finally lets you sneak by tough enemies or get behind them for a critical hit; there’s now horseback combat in large, open areas which gives you more mobility and the ability to attack on both sides with your right-handed weapon, but has the drawback of taking away your ability to roll out of the way of big attacks; you can craft items on the fly using materials found in the world so you can be ready for whatever a situation calls for; you can summon a large variety of creatures to fight for you, each with their own unique abilities and situational advantages; and most substantially, you can equip Ashes of War to your weapons and completely change their affinity and skill. The Ashes of War system essentially combines two elements of prior Souls games – weapon affinities and weapon skills – by making them items that you can freely equip to your armaments. For example, let’s say I find a really good rapier and I really like the moveset, but I’m building my character with a focus on the Intelligence stat, which means it won’t get the kind of damage bonuses it needs to be a viable weapon. If I find an Art of War that bestows a magic spell onto a weapon, I can equip it and transform it into a magic weapon, thereby giving it Intelligence scaling on top of whatever skill the Ash of War has. Best of all, if I eventually decide to respec into a different build, I can still keep the same weapon and just put a different Ash of War onto it. Of course, you also have to find a specific item to unlock the different affinities, but it's nonetheless an incredibly smart addition that allows for a ton of variety in your preferred weapons. The most important element of Elden Ring’s philosophy, though, is the freedom to just walk away and do something else when you hit a wall. Elden Ring is hard – which is to be expected from a FromSoft game – but its difficulty surprised me, even as a veteran of the Soulslike genre. I hit multiple points, even all the way up until the moment when I reached the very last boss, where I’d unlocked paths to several bosses and simply could not make headway on any of them. But even though I hit dead ends on those paths, there was always somewhere else I could go – a region I hadn’t thoroughly explored, an NPC quest that I had set aside for later, a Light of Grace indicator that I had not yet followed. There was never a point in Elden Ring when I was at a complete loss of what to do, and every time I explored those other regions and followed those alternate paths I would find new gear and items, level up my stats, or learn new spells or skills that would eventually give me the extra edge I needed to power through a boss that had given me problems. Sekiro evolves From Software’s formula into a stylish stealth-action adventure that, naturally, emphasizes precision and skill in its combat. It walks the line between deliberate and patient stealth and breakneck melee combat against threats both earthly and otherworldly. Its imaginative and flexible tools support a more focused experience that shaves down some of From Software’s overly cryptic sensibilities without losing its air of mystery. Sekiro is an amazing new twist on a familiar set of ideas that can stand on its own alongside its predecessors. It isn’t just the promise of making my numbers go up that called me to turn over every stone on the map: The Lands Between is positively brimming with riches, intrigue, and danger at every turn. Much of what Elden Ring’s open world does well can be traced directly back to things that made Breath of the Wild stand out from the many open-world games that came before it. (The PC version of Elden Ring also unfortunately borrows some of Breath of the Wild’s stuttery framerate woes). It’s that same feeling of starting out in a world with little explicit guidance, finding something that piques your curiosity on your own, doing whatever it takes to get there, and then being rewarded for that curiosity. The big difference is that in Breath of the Wild I could usually predict what’s going to happen when I get to that orange glowy thing off in the distance. I’ll do a puzzle, unearth a shrine, do another puzzle, and probably get a cool temporary weapon and a spirit orb. That’s not to take anything away from Breath of the Wild – it was awesome, but that pattern became somewhat routine well before the end. In Elden Ring, by contrast, very rarely did my predictions come true. I’d head to a lake and all of a sudden get ambushed by a dragon, follow a river expecting to collect some minor crafting materials only to find a dungeon filled with enemies and traps, enter a cave and get ambushed by little goblin men, or take a seemingly unimposing elevator and find that it just keeps going down further and further and further… until eventually I found myself not in a small dungeon but one of its many awe-inspiring new regions. Best of all, each of these little excursions rewards your curiosity with something worthwhile. That could be a new weapon, a new Ash of War, a valuable consumable, a new creature for you to summon, a new spell, or a new NPC to talk to. There are so many valuable rewards available that I never felt disappointed by my prize, regardless of the amount of effort it took. FromSoftware makes all of this especially painless thanks to a number of uncharacteristically friendly features. There’s a generous fast-travel system with a ton of points strewn all across the map; a marker system that lets you drop points on the map to denote things like NPCs, boss locations, out-of-reach treasure, materials, and more; and a speedy spectral horse named Torrent that allows you to quickly cover ground and easily mount and dismount as the situation requires.  But the thing that’s most impressive about Elden Ring is that, in between all of this brilliant open world design, there are also a handful of Legacy Dungeons that still deliver those “wide linear” levels that Souls fans have come to expect. These are gigantic castles, forts, manors, underground labyrinths, and more that are packed with secret areas, challenging bosses, and multiple paths that are linked via one-way shortcut doors. If they were strung all together without being tied to an open world, they could probably exist on their own as Dark Souls 4. Bottom line: Elden Ring’s open-world exploration is a new benchmark. It’s constantly exciting, rewarding, and full of moments that made me go “Holy shit” in a host of different ways. As far as combat goes, Elden Ring is certainly closest to Dark Souls 3 when compared to other games in FromSoftware’s library of action-RPGs, characterized by weighty attacks, careful stamina management, and a bit of a slower pace than games like Bloodborne and Sekiro. The two big new additions are the ability to use a guard counter by blocking an attack with your shield and immediately pressing the strong attack button to follow up with a crushing strike that can leave weaker enemies in a crumpled state, and a jump attack which gives melee weapon wielders a new type of heavy attack that can also be used to stun enemies and leave them open for a critical hit.   They’re both great additions that offer melee classes fun new tools, but for the most part, FromSoftware has certainly adopted an “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” approach. What really makes the combat in Elden Ring so good though is its enemy design and variety. Not only are a fair number of them horrifying (not quite up to Bloodborne levels of grotesquerie, but still some weapons-grade nightmare fuel) but some of these baddies are absolutely vicious, coming at you with wild swings and combos that seemingly go on forever and can hit from 10 feet away. Others are more methodical and hide behind their shields to wait for the right opportunity to either parry you or catch you while you’re winding up. Others still are weak, but can be huge threats when they ambush you with a grab that kills in one hit. Many are designed to punish those who just mash the dodge-roll button without care, which makes Elden Ring a very hard game, but it’s a good style of difficulty; one that’s less about fast reaction speeds and twitch reflexes (though those certainly help) and more about learning, adapting, and finding the planted weaknesses in an enemy’s attack patterns. Deciphering those tells and acting upon each moment of opportunity is a large part of why these games are so much fun. And then there are the bosses. I don’t want to spoil them, but there are a handful that are some of the most visually and mechanically impressive FromSoftware has ever crafted. Some of the later ones got really close to crossing the line in terms of what I’d deem fair and reasonable when it comes to life-restoring second phases after already brutally tough first phases and two or three-against-one handicap battles, but fortunately, as mentioned before, any walls I hit were surmountable once I took the time to do something else and come back stronger. It is no exaggeration to say that Elden Ring is FromSoftware’s largest and most ambitious game yet, and that ambition has more than paid off. Even after 87 hours of blood, sweat, and tears that included some of the most challenging fights I’ve ever fought, and innumerable surprises, there are still bosses that I left on the table, secrets that I’ve yet to uncover, sidequests that I missed out on, tons of weapons, spells, and skills that I’ve never used. And this is all on top of PVP and cooperative play that I’ve barely been able to scratch the surface of. Throughout it all, while the fundamentals of combat haven’t changed much from what we’ve seen before, the enormous variety of viciously designed enemies and the brutal but surmountable bosses have brought its battles to a new level. Even with all the threads I didn’t manage to tug on my first playthrough (of what I’m sure will be several), what I was treated to can easily be held amongst the best open-world games I’ve ever played. Like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild before it, Elden Ring is one that we’ll be looking back on as a game that moved a genre forward. "
162,Total War: Warhammer 3 Multiplayer ,9.0,"Note: This review covers the multiplayer of Total War: Warhammer 3. You can find our Total War: Warhammer 3 single-player campaign review here.Total War: Warhammer 3 has given me more reasons to fire up multiplayer than any game in the series’ history. It's the most effort Creative Assembly has ever put into making its campaign mode work for groups of up to eight friends, and while some network issues can still occasionally crop up like a Skaven undercity, it's pretty damn fun the rest of the time.  The biggest exciting innovations are simultaneous turns and the ability for anybody to pick any side in any battle. And when I say simultaneous, I don't mean everyone decides what they want to do and then it all resolves at the same time. What I mean is, when you start a new turn, if your friend is moving their army, you can actually see them moving. It's all happening in real time, and if you both want to take the same city, whoever clicks faster or is standing closer will get there first. There are some things I like about this and some I don't. For one, you'll sometimes be held up while the engine decides what to resolve first. If my friend is auto-resolving a battle and I'm selecting a technology, those can't both happen at the same time. So I might click on the tech and not see anything happen for a couple seconds, which makes the UI feel annoyingly unresponsive. It can be fun to race a rival to an objective, too, but the fact that it's twitch-based means you might have to prioritize moving one army quickly at the expense of another being beaten to the punch by a third player, which doesn't feel very Total War. But it’s definitely an improvement over having to wait for everyone's turns to resolve one at a time. When you get to the combat resolution step, though, that's where the real fun begins. Even if the battle just involves one human player against an AI faction, up to eight people could theoretically become involved. Everyone gets to make their own decision about whether to join one side or the other, or just to spectate. They can also choose to control any reinforcing armies, if there are any. Once on the battle map, the leader of each army can assign any units, lords, and heroes to any player on their side. So it's possible to have some truly epic four-vs-four showdowns that give everyone something to do, even if they have no stake in either army on the campaign map. Just be careful if you're playing against a friend who's way better than you, because if they want to mess with you, they can really grind your campaign to a halt by taking control of your enemies in every engagement. All of this works in the Realms of Chaos campaign, which I covered extensively in my single-player review of Warhammer 3. But given how long that campaign can take to finish, I wouldn't really recommend trying to tackle it in multiplayer unless you and your friends are under a 10-day quarantine. Luckily, there are also two multiplayer-exclusive campaigns that are paced perfectly for a Sunday evening of beer and bloodshed. Something Rotten in Kislev is a co-op experience for three players that’s based around defending Kislev from hordes of daemons, with some internal tension borrowed from the main campaign's struggle between the Ice Court and the Orthodoxy. It's a nice little compstomp that can be finished in 15 turns, with my only major complaint being that it only features five of Total War: Warhammer's dozens of factions. That can get a little repetitive. Total War: Warhammer 3’s single-player mode presents us with a tense, challenging, multilayered campaign driven along by a compelling story and a memorable cast of rivals. The Chaos Realms cleverly draw these larger-than-life figures together, so even those from remote corners of the world will be able to test each other's mettle. And while the size of the faction list currently feels a bit disappointing coming from Mortal Empires, all of the newly introduced factions are inventive and just plain fun on the campaign and battle maps. The true test of Warhammer 3 is still to come, when we'll get to play with all the factions from all three games on the massive combined map. But even if that's the main reason you're interested in it, there's plenty of excitement to be had already. The other campaign is Darkness and Disharmony, which supports up to eight players and is set during a chaotic time in Cathay's history when daemons and ogres were running around making a real mess of the place. There are also some NPC factions like the greenskins knocking around, and everyone from Greasus to N'kari to Miao Ying is playable, so it has a lot more variety in the types of battles you get to fight. It's a pretty simple race for territory, with each held settlement giving you one victory point per turn. The first person to 40 points wins, so these rarely last more than 20 turns. Technology, construction, and recruitment have also been sped up in both of the mini campaigns, and I think the length is just about spot-on. That all said, I have run into some noticeable network issues, particularly playing with people from other regions. Disconnects are somewhat common, which can lead to having to reload from a previous turn. And lag can sometimes be so bad that it looks like Tsar Boris is galloping across the plains in slow motion. It's not a constant problem, but it is frequent enough that we almost gave up on this campaign. You can, of course, also play individual battles in ranked matchmaking. It's disappointing to see that it’s limited to only the Warhammer 3 races for now, since I've been waiting to see how my old favorites like the Wood Elves fare against the new guys. It could be a lot more fleshed out, but I'm glad it's there for the more competitive set.  Total War: Warhammer 3’s single-player mode presents us with a tense, challenging, multilayered campaign driven along by a compelling story and a memorable cast of rivals. The Chaos Realms cleverly draw these larger-than-life figures together, so even those from remote corners of the world will be able to test each other's mettle. And while the size of the faction list currently feels a bit disappointing coming from Mortal Empires, all of the newly introduced factions are inventive and just plain fun on the campaign and battle maps.

163,Lost Ark ,8.0,"There’s never been an isometric action RPG quite so expansive or adventurous as Lost Ark. This stylish, free-to-play MMO took South Korea by storm in 2019, so it’s no surprise it’s now blowing away Steam charts in the West. Its story may be generic fantasy, but there’s a surprising degree of depth to each of its sprawling systems, and most of its content is accessible to play through by yourself or with friends. It’s the kind of game that’s easy to lose hours in even without spending any money, especially once you get your very own ship and set sail to pave your own path through its mysterious world.   Once you finish Lost Ark’s tutorial with less information than you probably need, you enter the online world where you’re propelled through a 10-hour linear series of main story quests. It’s all very flexible in how you approach other players: most story progress happens in instanced events, but sometimes you’ll need to complete an instanced dungeon – which is a completely separate thing, as Final Fantasy 14 fans are already familiar with – and you can complete that alone or in a party of up to four, based on your own preferences instead of absolutely needing to play with others. It’s also rare that the many other players running around will get in your way, due to how quickly enemies and quest objectives respawn in public zones. In fact, the only content that absolutely requires you to team up doesn’t arrive until after level 50, and that’s largely part of Lost Ark’s open-ended (albeit grindy) endgame where you’re free to pick and choose what you want to do. The story of Lost Ark boils down to the now overdone “Humans and Angels team up to fight Demons and save the world” structure, and it suffers from some pretty hamfisted writing and voice acting that can make the tone and pacing come across awkwardly at times. Action-packed cutscenes often help tell that story, and they tend to be a visual treat, but it’s unfortunate that characters’ emotions are poorly conveyed at basically all times. A major contributing factor is that character voices tend to bounce between either wild exaggeration or an inappropriate lack of emphasis in relation to the stakes of the moment. As a result, they generally come across as one-sided and forgettable rather than unique or interesting, and emotional moments struggle to land. What saves it are the great action sequences, which are well scripted and fantastically creative enough to do all the heavy lifting for the story. There’s an excellent segment where your character runs through a king’s tomb while being chased by an otherworldly, fire-breathing dragon as the firmaments crumble around you. You’re eventually forced to face it down in a climactic final confrontation, which is equally difficult and satisfying, and even looks great by modern standards – so good, in fact, that it was surprising to learn that Lost Ark is still using Unreal Engine 3. Each of Lost Ark’s five classes and numerous subclasses have special abilities that define their playstyles. For example, the Assassin can choose to subclass as the extremely stylish demonic Shadowhunter, who absolutely stands out amongst the rest as one of the coolest melee classes in any action RPG. It’s deeply satisfying to unleash the Shadowhunter’s souped-up demon form (which you do after summarily consuming the blood of your enemies, naturally) and rip and tear your way through anything that gets in your way. Another favorite is the Striker, who slowly builds up a resource that they can unleash in powerful martial arts-inspired flourishes. One of these transforms you into a tornado that lifts entire crowds of enemies into the air at once, which is both an effective stun power and a lot of fun to watch in action. Meanwhile, you have ranged classes like the Gunslinger who can fire a barrage of bullets, the Sorceress who can rain destruction upon her foes but has little armor and health, and plenty more. The only failing here is that there’s no real reason for any of these classes to be gender-locked. Why can’t you make a male Bard or a female Paladin? There’s a slickness to the flow of Lost Ark’s combat that feels more in line with Diablo 3 than games like Diablo 2, Path of Exile, or Grim Dawn. Your hotbar has a set number of skills and special attacks that each have their own cooldowns, but there’s no enforced “type” of skill that needs to go in any one slot. Instead, Lost Ark allows you to mix and match to your heart’s content, which lets you get creative with your character builds. For example, the Striker’s arsenal is mashed up between skills that build its Esoteric Bubble resource and skills that expend that resource to deal incredible bursts of damage. You could theoretically ignore the Esoteric Bubble resource altogether and kit yourself out with more low-stakes DPS skills with shorter cooldowns, making you a more rapid damage-dealer. Inversely, you can do the opposite of that and give yourself more skills that take a long time to power up but carry a higher payoff.  Despite all that customization, classes adhere to specific mechanical roles no matter what. The Bard is always a support class, the Striker is always a DPS class, and the Gunlancer is always a tank. However, it’s nice to be able to swap out or respecialize your skills on the fly, and if you’d like to make your fighting style even more dynamic, you can always store grenades and other useful items on your hotbar to supplement your skill loadout even further. You’ll generally need to fight many enemies at once, and some of your skills require you to hold their respective key down in order to power them up or keep them rolling in a combo, which usually feels good to do since those moves often have the most explosive effects. Another nod to Diablo 3 (the console version, specifically) is that Lost Ark lets you use a limited rolling dodge ability to quickly get out of harm’s way every few seconds, and some battles absolutely require you to make good use of that ability. Most bosses telegraph their attacks as shown by red areas (cones, circles, etc) on the floor, giving you a short window of time to get the heck out of there. However, fights begin to stagnate once you’ve bashed your way through swarms of enemies for a few hours because you can't adjust the difficulty manually. Most enemies rush you in groups that you can easily dispatch by spamming your hotkeys in a steady rotation, and it’s easy to tune out unless you’re specifically fighting a boss with unique mechanics, such as Rekiel of Despair (who’s protected by a special shield that makes his attacks hit harder and make him impervious to being Staggered until you break it by using a Destruction Bomb) or Jagan, the giant dragon demon guarding King Luterra’s Tomb that you need to kill several times as you venture through that dungeon.  What makes Jagan especially interesting is that he rips apart the walls and staircases as you move through the environment, which is impressive, but spectacle like that makes normal fights feel like you’re just bashing apart the same identical exploding sacks of gore. Not to mention, when you wander through the open world enemies tend to respawn before you get a moment to step away from where you defeated them seconds prior. This would be far more rewarding if they actually dropped a significant amount of experience points or better loot, but they never do. The best you can hope for is a piece of gear that offers a slight stat point upgrade, but no visual variation from what you were already using. That first 10 hours or so are entirely linear, but once you unlock your first ship and head out to the open seas you can theoretically go in any direction you’d like to (but, pro tip: you may want to stick to the upper-right side of the map until you reach level 50 because things can get rough out there). Sailing is simpler yet more enjoyable than Pillars of Eternity 2’s, which is my closest point of comparison for what Lost Ark is trying to accomplish as an open-world isometric RPG. Both games give you a ship and say “you can do anything you want as long as you don’t crash it,” but Lost Ark cuts everything that made sailing a boring or trifling experience in Pillars. You can run headfirst into various nautical hazards, such as sandstorms and ghost ships, which adds tension and risk to your travels. You can also find treasure, go fishing, and hang out with whales. Your ship needs regular maintenance, compelling you to dock and, since you’re limited to teleportation across the continent you’re currently on, you’re provided a real motivation to explore your immediate surroundings whenever you go on shore leave. It’s already great fun to chart a course across the high seas, but I’m extremely excited to see how that system evolves over time. Once you earn your sails you can discover unique and interesting settings, such as a remote library filled with talking books, derelict ghost ships, and distant continents that were previously unreachable by foot. Each of the 13 substantial continents has its own theme, culture, and environment, and the impressive variety works well in Lost Ark’s favor. More importantly, the story actually uses these unique settings to show something interesting on screen. For instance, the technocratic society of Arthetine looks and feels like Final Fantasy 7 Remake’s rendition of Midgar, even though its story also pulls from a bucket list of Warhammer 40k tropes; even its guards look like space marines. But that’s just one location in the broader world of Arkesia, and no two places are similar. In stark contrast, the island-continent of Tortoyk is populated by Mokokos, faeries that live in a village that requires you to shrink yourself in order to visit. Once there, you ride lady bugs as mounts and even face off against a giant parrot. Yes, Lost Ark features a boss battle that’s just a giant parrot. But if sailing isn’t your thing, there are plenty of other ways to spend your time. If you’d prefer to run off and try to impress every NPC through the conceptually interesting Rapport system, which allows you to use emotes or exchange gift items for rewards, you can do that. Or (after reaching level 26 and unlocking the Luterra Castle zone) you can focus on PvP, which are fun, short skirmishes that often come in the form of Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, and Team Elimination with up to five other players. Or you can focus on building up your personal stronghold through the decent crafting and gathering systems, which are pretty standard if you’ve played other MMORPGs apart from a few twists of their own, like being able to team up with other players to gather large trees faster. It’s worth mentioning that Lost Ark also conveniently lets any character chop every log and mine every ore node as long as you’ve equipped the right gathering tools and have sufficiently leveled up your respective gathering skills. Your stronghold essentially becomes your base of operations after you’ve reached a specific point in the story. Here, you can construct and upgrade buildings, assign missions, craft goods by placing requisition orders, and entertain luxury merchants who stop by to do business every so often. It’s a cool idea on paper, but I rarely felt a need to ever go back to after a certain point. The deterrent for me was that stronghold actions are timed and require a limited resource to speed up, and that resource is, of course, for sale for real money. It feels very much like a Farmville-style mobile game mechanic that shatters the otherwise-successful illusion that Lost Ark isn’t out to wring cash out of us. Granted, it’s not essential to engage with your stronghold in order to enjoy the rest of what Lost Ark offers, but it’s the one thing that I might have felt tempted to spend real-world currency on had I invested myself deeper into the crafting systems, which of course, I ended up choosing to avoid. That said, it is quite cool that the gathering skills that fuel it are shared across characters on your account, as is the account-wide Roster level that raises the baseline for how powerful every character on your account starts out as. That means starting a new class doesn’t feel like going all the way back to square one. When I put aside my Striker main and started a Shadowhunter alt, the leveling process was far speedier than I’d remembered it, and I also achieved some extra progress for my Striker, who became more powerful simply because the Roster level went up a few notches in his absence. The only annoyance is that Lost Ark doesn’t apply Roster level rewards automatically, so if you aren’t paying attention you might just miss the menu where you need to claim the Roster level rewards for the individual character you’re currently playing as.  As is the trend in other MMORPGs, Lost Ark is free to play – though it does dabble with power-boosting pay-to-win mechanics a bit more than most. For example, you can pay real money to buy Royal Crystals, which function as the primary currency in the in-game store where you can buy cosmetic mounts and skins. Skins seem to vary wildly in cost (going no higher than 2,400 Royal Crystals at the moment), but mounts seem to cost somewhere in the ballpark between 1400-1700 Royal Crystals – roughly $14-17 USD.  Then there are regular Crystals, which can be earned through quests and high-end content like raids – but can currently be purchased with Royal Crystals at an exchange rate of 400 Crystals for 940 Royal Crystals or 200 Crystals for 470 Royal Crystals. That’s where the troublesome part comes in, because Crystals can be used to buy items like Phoenix Plumes that instantly revive you when you die (except for in PvP), making death irrelevant if you’re willing to spend roughly 25 real cents every time you go down.  You can also purchase items that instantly complete certain repeatable daily quests, called Una’s Tasks, for you – as long as you’ve completed them before. That gives paying players a distinct advantage by decreasing the amount of time they’ll need to wait in order to get major payouts of another type of ingame currency, called Una’s Tokens. These special coins are used to trade for Gold, the main currency that is spent on high-level gear and traded between players at the Market Board and Auction House in each major city.  Those are some undoubtedly questionable applications for a real-money currency. That said, it is neat that you can also use regular Crystals to buy the Crystalline Aura, a sort of subscription package that grants you major benefits to Lost Ark’s crafting, gathering, NPC schmoozing, and stronghold-building systems for a limited time upon activation. That means you can get many of its paid perks without spending a dime on Royal Crystals or buying one of Lost Ark’s several Founders Packs. As I mentioned before, most of the meat of Lost Ark’s story unfolds in instanced events and dungeons, both of which feature tons of elaborate cutscenes that fit seamlessly with all the hacking and slashing you spend much of your time participating in. Some of these moments are absolutely breathtaking, such as the aforementioned King’s Tomb or the battle of the Glorious Wall wherein you climb atop a siege tower and bang on a war drum, rallying your troops before landing on the battlements of the castle you and your NPC buds are sieging. It was a great feeling to be dropped directly into the thick of combat as the camera panned around the battlefield from above, and it sticks in my head as not just a standout moment of Lost Ark but one of the more memorable highlights of any video game I’ve ever played. That said, you’re required to grind your way to a certain gear level before you can see the very end of the story, and that’s a drag. There’s a way to bypass some of the grind by unlocking and completing the northern continent, Shushire, but if you just want to stick to the much simpler combat-focused, wave-based Chaos Dungeons, you’re limited to only two runs per day. Since you’ll only find gear sporadically, that’s hardly enough to ensure a full set of endgame-suited equipment on your first run, or even your first several runs. It’s a big hill to climb. Lost Ark takes a genuinely impressive stab at the isometric action RPG genre, and its integration into a perpetually online world is complementary rather than invasive. It’s expansive and deep, capable of scratching the itch for a new Diablo-like action RPG that is filled with other players to meet and team up with. The excellent and flexible combat system channels the best of its ARPG forebears, but it can start to wear out after you’ve slaughtered your way through enough lower-tier enemies. Lost Ark’s most prominent fault, though, is that its generic story can be cheesy due to awkward writing and voice work. However, there are a lot of interesting locations to discover as you sail your ship around the open seas, and at the end of the day, this is a world that’s certainly worth the time to explore, even if you never pay a cent for its optional premium boosts.

164,Uncharted Movie ,7.0,"Uncharted hits theaters on Feb. 18, 2022. Uncharted is a simple, safe, but ultimately pretty effective introduction to treasure hunter Nathan Drake. Fans of the beloved PlayStation games might be surprised to see how much has changed to fit an Uncharted story in a single movie’s runtime – it squeezes in a new origin story while reenacting action sequences from multiple games – but it all makes for a decently fun sampling of what Nate and Sully have to offer on the big screen.  For an origin story, Uncharted ironically doesn’t waste any time explaining the backstories of any of the characters. We’re immediately thrown into the exploits of cocky young thief Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) and veteran treasure hunter Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), who tries to recruit Nate for an upcoming heist. They’re both looking for the next big score and that's really all the backstory you need to know. This allows Uncharted to hit the ground running, in a good way; I appreciate that the script doesn’t spend much time on unnecessary exposition, assuming you’re either in for the adventure or not. It doesn’t take long for Nate and Sully to meet up with the mysterious Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), a fun and energetic addition who keeps everyone in this world-spanning adventure on their toes. As a fan of the games, the biggest question I had was if Tom Holland could pull off Nathan Drake, playing a slightly younger version of the character we know. The answer, thankfully, is yes. He’s as charismatic as ever, sinking his teeth into playing an Indiana Jones-type. I was never once distracted by the fact that this is the same actor who played Spider-Man in one of the biggest movies ever just a couple months ago. Mark Wahlberg does a decent job playing a wise-cracking mentor to Holland, but some of the things that make Sully so recognizable in the game didn’t survive the transition to the film. Sully is iconic, at least in part, because of his thick mustache and dark, booming voice, none of which Wahlberg has. After all, there’s no reason they couldn’t have thrown a ‘stache on Wahlberg, which even young Sully has in the games. At times, it felt like Mark Wahlberg was just playing Mark Wahlberg in an action movie instead of, you know, Sully. That being said, Wahlberg and Holland have fun chemistry, including some very good emotional scenes, so it’s mostly pretty easy to look past him not being entirely loyal to the source material. The cat-and-mouse plot doesn’t take itself too seriously, which is exactly what I would expect from a movie based on the Uncharted games. Basically, if this were a two-hour video game cutscene (which, I guess, is technically a movie anyway), I never felt like I wanted to press the skip button. We don’t get many moments that lean into its video game origins, but the movie does a fine job bringing the world of Uncharted to life. It plays it safe, seeing Nate, Sully, and Chloe engaging in witty and sometimes tech-heavy banter that isn’t prevalent in the games (for example, Nate makes fun of Sully for having Tinder on his phone). The trio gets into their fair share of fights, chase scenes, and booby traps as they go about collecting clues, solving puzzles, and traveling the world. It’s all pretty straightforward, but there were plenty of fun reminders that I was watching an Uncharted movie. Plus, Uncharted sets itself apart from other generic heist movies by leaning in on its solid dialogue and the silly, immature ways Nate tends to act in deadly situations. Very early on, Nate bumps into fellow treasure hunter Moncada (Antonio Banderas), and the way they exchange quips is endearing in a cartoonish sort of way. These types of scenes will be fun for a casual audience, but for those familiar with the games, it’s a loving recreation of the defining traits we know and love the most about Nathan Drake. Speaking of the villains, the ones here are mostly forgettable. Antonio Banderas is great, but he’s not on screen nearly enough; his hired gun (Tati Gabrielle) is meant to be an equal rival from Sully’s past, but so little time is spent with her that I had to look up her name (it's Braddock) after I finished watching because the few passing mentions weren’t memorable at all. The villains’ storylines are anti-climatic and one-dimensional, and any motives for seeking the big treasure beyond simple greed are unclear. In a way, though, it’s oddly fitting, because while the Uncharted games have featured many antagonists, the real evil has always been about what greed can do to people. That theme is present throughout the movie, and that’s good enough for me. Announced in 2009, the Uncharted movie had been in development for so long that Mark Wahlberg went from being originally cast as Nathan Drake to eventually playing father-figure Victor Sullivan. In that time, the movie would have six directors come and go, including Shawn Levy (who left to direct Free Guy) and Dan Trachtenberg of 10 Cloverfield Lane fame. Sony finally locked in Venom director Ruben Fleischer in early 2020 and actually began filming in March 2020, only to shut down immediately due to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. After a decade of different writers, directors, and creative and scheduling conflicts, it made me wonder if there was some sort of ancient curse on this movie. Luckily, Sony was finally able to solve the puzzle, lift the curse, and find the treasure (which was my movie ticket). My favorite scenes in Uncharted all lived in the final act, where we finally see Nate and Sully in their element of pirate caves, shootouts, and shouting one-liners while being attacked by henchmen. It’s not until the end that we truly see the movie lean into its video game counterpart, with Holland running, jumping, and narrowly escaping death in moments that could have easily been a quick-time event. The love for the games is especially present in two mid-credit scenes, and it made me wonder why this movie couldn’t have been more of a direct interpretation. While it gets away with doing a new origin story and remixing other storylines directly from the games, it left me wanting more in a frustrating way. Still, if it’s your first experience with Uncharted, it’s a solid adventure that benefits from Holland’s charm, no matter how straightforward the plot might be.  Uncharted is a safe but serviceable sampling of a new globe-spanning adventure. As a young Nathan Drake, Tom Holland is fun to watch and has good chemistry with Mark Wahlberg’s Victor Sullivan, even if their antagonists are pretty forgettable and the story never thinks outside the treasure chest box. This should be effective in introducing the world of Uncharted to people who are meeting Nate and friends for the first time, although the changes it makes can be inexplicable and jarring to those of us who’ve spent many games with these characters.

165,Total War: Warhammer 3 Single-Player ,9.0,"Note: This review covers the single-player campaign of Total War: Warhammer 3. Keep an eye out for our multiplayer review soon after launch. The battle maps all look gorgeous, though. Well, except the ones that are supposed to be horrifying, like the putrid swamps of Nurgle or impossible spiraling towers of Tzeentch, which are appropriately breathtaking in their own way. The campaign map, though, looks a bit less detailed than Warhammer 2. Some of the ground textures are noticeably lower-res, and especially some of the trees and vegetation seem to have had their polygon budget gutted, even on max settings. The map is also considerably bigger than even Mortal Empires, so I can understand if this had to be done for performance reasons. And it does run very well on my Ryzen 7 3700X/RTX 2060 Super-driven system, only rarely dropping below 30fps at 1080p with everything cranked up. While the campaign map itself wasn't always dazzling, the new diplomatic options and quality-of-life features it brings are some of the best parts of Warhammer 3. They're the easiest upgrades to forget about when you quickly get used to them, but I'd miss the heck out of them if I went back to Warhammer 2. The brilliant Quick Deal button we first saw in Total War: Three Kingdoms makes it easy to see who would be willing to sign a trade agreement without having to open every faction's embassy individually. A ""Balance Deal"" button cuts down on what must have added up to hours I used to have to spend just to see how much gold I could get out of a peace treaty by trying different amounts over and over. Now we can cut out the haggling and get down to business.  On top of that, alliances are much more rewarding than what we’ve seen in the previous two games, since here you can construct outposts in allied settlements that let you recruit their units as a return on your investment. So if you're playing as the Daemons of Khorne and you need some ranged firepower to complement your extremely melee-focused horde of bloodthirsty ravagers, making friends with Tzeentch will give you four army slots that can be spent on his units. There's also a useful new favors system that can allow you to, among other cool things, just borrow an entire army stack from an ally temporarily. Even without cross-faction recruitment, all of the newcomer factions in Warhammer 3 are creative, fresh, and interesting in and of themselves. Slaanesh can seduce units to his side in battle and even beguile entire factions. Cathay can send caravans off to the far-flung corners of the world and they send back exciting random events and the chance to have heroes from other factions join your caravan. And Khorne spawns free armies when razing a settlement, which can then go on to raze more settlements and spawn more free armies, creating the most gleefully aggro faction in a world with a lot of very aggro factions. One of the hardest decisions was simply deciding which one I wanted to try out next.  And that’s just on the strategic map; they each have a distinct and novel feel on the battlefield, too. Tzeentch's units have barriers that recharge when they're out of combat, encouraging hit-and-run tactics. Cathay's harmony system rewards you for keeping ranged and melee troops together, making them the ultimate combined arms formation army. The Ogre Kingdoms have infantry that can carry around cast iron artillery guns like it's no big deal, which has led to some of my most hilarious and joyfully lopsided victories.  The real star of the campaign, though, is the Daemons of Chaos faction. They’re able to recruit from the rosters of all four Chaos gods, and you can customize your murderous Prince of the Apocalypse with wonderfully deadly body parts, from scythe hands to cloven hooves to enormous crow wings, all giving different bonuses. You even get to name him! Ragnarr, my large adult Daemon son, devoted himself to Khorne and ended up with a sword that deals roughly one billion armor-piercing damage, as well as an ability that healed him every time someone died nearby. There's nothing quite like taking a warm, soothing shower in the arterial blood spraying from your vivisected foes. The customization and sense of ownership made them easily my favorite faction. And you get introduced to the would-be Prince in a riveting prologue that might be the best Total War tutorial for complete newcomers I've ever seen. Total War: Warhammer 3’s single-player mode presents us with a tense, challenging, multilayered campaign driven along by a compelling story and a memorable cast of rivals. The Chaos Realms cleverly draw these larger-than-life figures together, so even those from remote corners of the world will be able to test each other's mettle. And while the size of the faction list currently feels a bit disappointing coming from Mortal Empires, all of the newly introduced factions are inventive and just plain fun on the campaign and battle maps. The true test of Warhammer 3 is still to come, when we'll get to play with all the factions from all three games on the massive combined map. But even if that's the main reason you're interested in it, there's plenty of excitement to be had already. "
166,Horizon Forbidden West ,9.0,"Successful sequels build on their predecessors in multiple ways – think Mass Effect 2, Assassin's Creed 2, and Uncharted 2. They all improve what came before them by conjuring up exciting new gameplay mechanics, developing characters through engaging stories, and switching up mission design to offer variety. In other words, they take a solid base and combine with new elements to create more advanced bonds, much like an alloy… or in this case, an Aloy. Horizon Forbidden West does this with aplomb, building on the already impressive foundations of 2017’s Horizon Zero Dawn to tell a thrilling story full of familiar explosive combat against elaborate robotic foes and blockbuster action sequences, but also adding Witcher-like settlements to the map and filling it out with great side quests. There’s a genuine sense of exploration and loads of completely involving lore behind it all to uncover. The result is a fantastic open-world action-adventure that, despite falling into a couple of its old habits, emphatically delivers on the promises made five years ago. The battle between the natural and firmly unnatural is everywhere to see in the Forbidden West. It drills down through many levels to what the Horizon series is all about, from the vines strangling the remains of San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge to the animal-like man-made machines that wander the land, tracing the footsteps of their long-dead creators. But this clash also takes place inside Aloy, who (spoilers for the first game) herself is a complicated combination of human and synthetic life. It's what drives the plot along and lends a personal touch to what could be otherwise ungainly themes if handled without the obvious care that developer Guerrilla Games has put into Forbidden West.  Once again, Aloy is on a time-sensitive mission packed with mystery, not least in its characters, many of whom are firmly established in the grey area between friend or foe. Its twists and turns are numerous and had me guessing how it would turn out right until the end of Aloy's journey. That journey isn't a short one; my playthrough (which was done at a fairly relaxed pace that included completing a healthy amount of side missions) took around 32 hours. Guerrilla has definitely learned a lesson this time around when it comes to finding a balance between worldbuilding and telling a coherent story. Horizon Zero Dawn tackled some big, ambitious ideas, but sometimes stumbled when it came to conveying them in an engaging way, with an over-reliance on audio and text files found in lifeless labs and abandoned offices. With the stage now firmly set, though, Forbidden West is able to confidently stride over the deep exposition potholes that Zero Dawn sometimes fell victim to, (mostly) mercifully avoiding lengthy information dumps in favour of a more elegantly told tale. While there are still a decent amount of audio logs to find, the quality of them is much improved, and more importantly, this time around all of the story’s key moments are told through engaging cutscenes that contain their fair share of character-centric drama without dwelling on it long enough to overstay their welcome. This is still very much a hard sci-fi setting, though, and that is where the slightly weaker parts of Forbidden West’s story lay during the opening hours. Sometimes it just can't help but stray into overlong monologues referring back to the events of Zero Dawn and the setup for the journey west, and that’s where some momentum is lost. This makes for an uneven start, but the pace promptly picks up and becomes much more engaging once a new threat is introduced and the true plot of Forbidden West comes to the fore. From here on it successfully rumbles on its way to a full-on bonkers, yet highly enjoyable ending. It's also worth noting here that Forbidden West is very much a sequel to Zero Dawn, meaning newcomers attempting to skip the line and jump in here may feel slightly alienated by the overarching plot, though there's still plenty to enjoy regardless.  The story's strengths, however, far outweigh those awkward moments. It's much stronger when focusing on the personal dramas and social and political conflicts of the Forbidden West than when satiating its fetish for rambling holograms. If Horizon Zero Dawn was about Aloy discovering a dangerous new world, Forbidden West is all about a new world discovering just how dangerous Aloy can be. After the events of Zero Dawn, she’s a living legend: worshiped by some, feared by others. The present-day political turmoil between warring tribes paints a tense backdrop with plenty of room for great moments to play out in front of. There are some real standout missions, too: one questline involving a clumsy but loveable inventor trying to fulfill the ambitious legacy of his grandfather is a particular highpoint. It’s a perfect example of how well Aloy's quest collides with other people's stories to create something truly memorable. There are fantastic character moments that are delivered with a deft touch; it's a credit to the writers that I found myself caring so much about the fate of these people so quickly after meeting them. This goes for the actors embodying the characters, too – performances are brilliant across the board, with no one feeling out of place and even the most incidental seeming characters well observed. That’s no mean feat considering the large cast of fresh faces you'll meet throughout your playthrough. Across a vast and beautiful open world, Horizon Zero Dawn juggles many moving parts with polish and finesse. Its main activity - combat - is extremely satisfying thanks to the varied design and behaviors of machine-creatures that roam its lands, each of which needs to be taken down with careful consideration. Though side questing could have been more imaginative, its missions are compelling thanks to a central mystery that led me down a deep rabbit hole to a genuinely surprising - and moving - conclusion. Part of that is due to the fact that Forbidden West is far more concerned about the world as a whole and the people surrounding Aloy than Zero Dawn ever was; from early on it becomes apparent that the whole lesson of the story for Aloy is allowing some of the pressure she places on herself to be carried by others. The supporting cast does a great job of keeping you company, and Varl – an old friend of Aloy’s from the Nora tribe who is with you from the opening moments – in particular, provides warm companionship throughout and brings the best out of Aloy. It’s a pleasant change when compared to the often-lonely adventure of Zero Dawn. Actors Angela Bassett and Carrie-Anne Moss bring salvos of Hollywood-caliber firepower to the story; the former provides a fearsome presence as rebel leader Regala, even if she is too absent for long stretches to feel like a prominent piece of the story. Meanwhile, Moss brings a touch of class to proceedings as the enigmatic Tilda. It’s never enough to wrestle the limelight away from Ashly Burch as Aloy, though. Naturally, she’s at the core of everything in Forbidden West, and Burch carries that weight with confidence and panache – displaying power in loud, pivotal moments, but also shining in the story's quieter, more heartfelt pockets. On the topic of the loud parts, while Zero Dawn may have been action-packed, its presentation never felt nearly as cinematic as this. Massive moments take place in masterfully choreographed cutscenes with swirling camerawork reminiscent of a Tony Scott chase sequence. It may seem simple, but subtler techniques (such as a wider lens used during conversations) add a filmic quality to dialogue-heavy scenes, allowing characters to use their bodies to move expressively and convey a wider range of emotion. Feelings run high over the course of the lengthy campaign, and while this isn’t anything like the trauma fest of something like The Last of Us Part 2, Forbidden West certainly tugs on the heartstrings. A stealthy approach, laying in wait to silently strike from tall grass, is almost always wise at the start of a fight as you'll likely get into the most trouble when you’re outnumbered. Even the less deadly machines, such as darting Skydrifters and pouncing Scrappers, pose a threat in numbers, and left unchecked they’ll relentlessly unleash attack after attack. Rarely has the saying ""attack is the best form of defense"" been truer, and just as in Zero Dawn these enemies’ bodies are loaded with weak points that allow you to affect the way they fight and change it to your liking. Take the new Clawstrider, for example: it’s an extremely aggressive dino menace that can wipe you out with lashes of its devastating tail. Had enough of it? Equip some tear arrows and split your tormentor's tail straight off. Alternatively, coat it with a yellow gloop using the new adhesive ammo to slow it down, which is extremely effective against quick machines like this. That cycle of learning an enemy and their multiple different attacks, reducing the number of options available to them by targeting and destroying their weapons, and then finishing them off with ice, fire, acid, or whatever other damage types they’re weak to never grew tired over dozens of hours. The combat in Zero Dawn was already fantastic, and Forbidden West only stacks more options on top of that – such as new weapons and ammo types – and feels better and more flexible than ever as a result. The explosive Spike Thrower is a particularly satisfying new addition to Aloy’s collection of weaponry, lodging projectiles into machines before detonating them to cause big damage. I found this to be a near-essential item against some of Forbidden West’s bigger beasts. Many of these battles are of a scale and a quality that many games would aspire to for their grand finales. Knocking off their heavy weapons and then picking them up to turn their own guns against them adds a dynamic edge that rewards good aim with more firepower. Cleaving the cannon off of a Ravager and unleashing a barrage into the side of Tremortusk – a gigantic and very angry robot mammoth – is a pure, unadulterated power trip. The superb score also soundtracks perfectly throughout, dynamically cranking up the noise during high-stakes battles and adding crunchy electronics to the familiar orchestral refrains from Zero Dawn. The central piece of Aloy’s arsenal remains the bow and arrow though, with many different versions on offer. Mixing and matching to make sure you have all of the different types of elemental damage you need on your weapon wheel is key; the next step is being skilled enough to hit your fast-moving targets. Admittedly, I’m a sucker for archery combat in games, but it really doesn’t get much better than unleashing arrow after arrow into the glowing weak point of a metal menace. It also really brings out the best of the PlayStation 5’s DualSense, which lets you feel the bowstring tighten on your trigger finger before the recoil cascades through your controller. The machines themselves are exquisitely designed, each bringing their own bag of party tricks to the West. The hippo-like Widemaw that pulls you in with its vacuum mouth before spitting boulders at you is a considerable threat early on, so there’s something extra satisfying about being able to one-shot one with a well-placed projectile between its metal teeth as you grow more powerful. The speed and power with which the machines move is a sight to behold – not that you’ll have much time to stop and stare as they barrel towards you. But if you allow yourself to slip into slow motion for a moment you’ll be able to see each gear ticking within their gaping jaws before you need to dodge out of the way of death. Among the many returning machines is the Thunderjaw, which poses as prominent a threat as it did five years ago due to its vast array of weapons and its sheer size. Zero Dawn cranked up the difficulty near the end of its story, and it's not too different here either. There are a few particularly challenging machine types that you have no option but to take head-on, demanding you have full confidence in your chosen playstyle. Horizon Forbidden West had a huge weight of expectation laid upon it, yet the results manage to exceed all expectations. Its visuals, even on a base PS4, are cutting edge with a dense and dynamic world, vibrant colors, impeccable performance, and interactions that will leave you aghast at times thanks to the quality achieved. The PS4 Pro is even more impressive, with a higher level of detail, resolution, and overall quality. It already feels and performs like the premium package that all Pro owners will be ecstatic with from beginning to end. Achieving closer quality with the PS5 in performance mode. Of course, the PS5 manages to straddle that line between refined and enhanced perfectly. The 4K 30fps mode secures pixel perfection with a pin sharp and CGI-like delivery that displays the very best Guerrilla Games has to offer (as yet anyway). Meanwhile, the Performance mode enhances the already glorious PS4 Pro version with enhancements to its level of detail, post-processing effect improvements, and twice the performance. That still makes the PS5 the clear choice if you happen to own one of these elusive consoles. That said, the PS4 and PS4 Pro offer up an incredible package all the same, and it’s awe inspiring they pulled off such a technical feat at the end of the generation. Aloy’s skill trees are extensive and allow you to tailor exactly how you want to play, certainly offering a far more extensive menu to choose from than the original. Out of the six different columns available I put a lot of my points into the Hunter branch in order to maximise my bow skills and increase the effects of the concentration ability which allows you to slow down time. This also unlocked some handy secondary-fire abilities for my bow, such as being able to send a high arching volley of arrows onto a target for increased damage. Valor surges are special abilities unlocked on each skill tree that can be triggered intermittently throughout combat to really turn the tables in a fight – for example, one of the stealth surges harnesses Stalker machine technology to temporarily grant you a cloaking device, making it easy to ambush unsuspecting enemies. Combat encounters vary from fight to fight and eventually demand you display all of the skills at Aloy's disposal as bigger and bigger threats are thrown at you. It’s a great exercise in thinking on your feet and consistently provides excellent moment-to-moment gameplay. One huge contributing factor to this variety is the sheer amount of different enemy types in the Forbidden West. It’s not just in the range of machines on show, but also in the humans determined to stop you. Fighting packs of humans is entirely more dynamic in Forbidden West as you scramble around architecture and vegetation and in and out of stealth. It definitely feels like Aloy has ripped a page out of Ellie's journal here where it comes to how to handle these encounters. There's a fantastic weight to melee combat, which feels like a much more viable and – crucially – fun option this time around for Aloy. Swings of the spear crunch into enemies and unlockable combos add extra depth. These come in handy, especially against the energy shield-wielding rebel champions. In general, Aloy feels great to control in combat, light on her feet but heavy-hitting. All until you find yourself caught between a Rockbreaker and a hard place, that is. While not going so far as to adopt the ""climb anything"" approach of more Bokoblin-littered open-world games, there's a greater sense of freedom thanks to your new pulse's ability to scan for handholds on cliffs, and there’s usually a path to reach wherever you’d like to go. Although it’s undoubtedly an improvement on Zero Dawn, I did sometimes feel penned in by a world enveloped by mountains. It's in combat where this is often highlighted, when I’d feel myself scrambling around looking for a handhold to climb a four-foot wall that Aloy really should be able to vault over without even needing one. Unfortunately, this activity often ends in an untidy death at the hands of a trampling machine. It does feel a bit archaic to be restricted to predetermined handhold routes when we're used to much more freeform climbing in 2022. Similarly, while you can now grapple yourself to objects using the Pullcaster, don't think of this as being a game-changer on the level of Halo Infinite's Grappleshot or Just Cause’s grappling hook before it. In Forbidden West it's much more of a puzzle and combat tool used for getting out of sticky situations than it is something that will help you zip around its world. That being said, most of my quibbles with the climbing were quickly forgotten once a liberating new ability (which I won’t spoil) is introduced later on and makes moving around the map a much more exciting proposition. It comes as a great relief too, as it’s a world I wanted to spend a considerable time exploring. A rapturous harmony of beautiful natural landscapes and fearsome machines, Horizon Forbidden West is one of, if not the most visually impressive game I've ever played – even when playing on performance mode, which offers a smooth 60fps at the cost of some level of detail – a tradeoff which I’d wholeheartedly recommend due to the fact that it still looks fantastic. From tiny touches like individual blades of scarlet grass to awe-inducing landscapes that sweep the horizon, it’s an astonishingly detailed world. There’s verdant jungle, sweeping desert, snowy peaks, waves crashing like liquid crystal against sand… the list goes on. Seriously, though, sometimes the only thought that crossed my mind was ""f**k me, have you seen the look of this?!"" Forbidden West takes the time to ease you into its vast world. After a slightly pedestrian and linear tutorial section, it kicks into life and sets you free. It’s clear from early on that Guerrilla has spent a lot more time creating a more interesting open world this time around and nowhere is this clearer than in its settlements, which are universally a vast improvement over Zero Dawn’s comparatively lifeless equivalents. These range from small villages made up of huts and traders to large towns, each with their own quirks. My favourites are those that make homes of old-world architecture – Plainsong, for example, is a commune repurposing a series of nature-reclaimed satellite dishes. There are many to discover, each beautifully unique, including one particular enrapturing underground location that's home to one of the most visually striking video game levels in recent memory (and I won't dare spoil it). In general, the Forbidden West is littered with physical echoes of past humanity, making for a rich and visually compelling sandbox that almost serves as a museum to the history we’re living in now. It isn't just the environment, but the attention to detail placed in the humans. Each tribe is distinct from one another and the costume design on show is astounding. Aside from being places to stock up on resources and acquire new weapons and armor from merchants, these clusters of civilization are where a lot of side missions will begin. This is probably the biggest area of improvement for Forbidden West when compared to its predecessor, which had very limited and repetitive optional content. Side quests are infinitely more engaging and pretty lengthy, too – they’re not just throwaway requests from nameless wanderers but instead are smartly woven into the main story. Some will involve characters you’ll meet along the main plot asking more personal requests of you, while others will be completely new faces asking you to help out with social issues, such as helping depose a town’s unlikeable leader from his position of power. These side stories only enrich the experience, and while you may not have many active choices to make that influence their outcome, I really did feel like I was changing the world around me as I made my way through it. In that respect, it’s quite easy to be reminded of The Witcher 3 in the way it approaches its secondary missions: you’re not only all but guaranteed a fun time but also very likely to find satisfying stories and unique pieces of gear for your troubles.  For example, one treasure hunt-like quest had me diving into caves and digging through shipwrecks in order to find an ancient piece of technology that I could repurpose into a unique type of tripcaster (the tripwire deploying weapon from the original) that deploys shields instead of the standard traps. A good portion of the side quests and people you meet along the way also help shine some light when compared to the relevant dark themes of the main story. There's a great levity to the writing, which manages to flow seamlessly between talk of world-ending events to witty one-liners. The different quirky characters met and distinctive rewards received from each side quest means that they very rarely feel repetitive. It's a real credit that, in a world so dense with objective markers, very few (if any) feel like rinse-and-repeat jobs. Yes, some missions are just glorified fetch quests (true of virtually every game ever), but when the parts you're fetching are the antlers of a fire-breathing metal antelope, there’s rarely a dull moment. Outside of side quests, there’s a long list of other activities available: rebel camps to clear out, different types of collectables to find, arenas to test your might in, and of course, scaleable Tallnecks, the giraffe-like recon giants. Cauldrons also return from Zero Dawn, and these challenging dungeons that are carved into mountain sides grant you the ability to override machines’ will and make them fight for you. A particular favourite of mine are the new Relic Ruins, which are fun little puzzle boxes hidden around the world that put all of your mental tools to the test. Some of which take a considerable time to solve, as if bitesize chunks of Tomb Raider have been transplanted into a far-flung future. That Witcher 3 influence even extends to the minigame Machine Strike, a strategy board game that contains all the addictive qualities of Gwent or Assassin's Creed Valhalla's Orlog. It’s impressively deep and there are many, many people in the world to go up against, all with their own boards, pieces, and playstyles. It not only begs to be played for hours on end but also encourages exploration in order to find new machine miniatures to add to your collection. The action isn’t just restricted to the many, many objective icons on the map though – aimless wandering is rewarded with random events taking place across the world, which gives a sense of real discovery. These range from fighting off some rebels who have prepared an ambush by a rocky path to rescuing a family from a herd of aggressive machines, and many more. Occasions like this further build on a feeling of genuine causality to your actions in the world too, as you’ll bump into the same people later at a settlement who will thank Aloy for playing the role of hero. On top of all of this, there's just so much to see and do that I don't want to spoil in any way. Characters, creatures, and locations that I wouldn't want the joy and surprise that I experienced discovering taken away from others. For large swaths of it, the Forbidden West really is a place that needs to be seen to be believed. A triumphant combination of enthralling combat, top-tier creature and character design, and a captivating open world, Horizon Forbidden West is an absolute blast and fantastic showcase for the power of the PS5. Although the return of a couple of familiar series trappings and a noticeable lack of freeform climbing never threatens to derail the enjoyment, it does leave it falling frustratingly short of something revolutionary. Major evolutionary steps have firmly been placed in the right direction, however, and there’s no doubting the many, many hours of fun to have with Aloy, who stakes her claim further to be one of this generation of gaming’s greatest characters. Guerrilla has outdone itself yet again with Forbidden West, and at this trajectory, neither the horizon nor the sky's the limit for what could come next. "
167,Sifu ,9.0,"From the very first punch, Sifu is utterly uncompromising in its design. Absolver developer Sloclap’s latest martial arts beat-em-up is bold, its combat exquisite, its animation top-notch, its music outstanding, and its story – while very simple – is poignant and elegantly told. It’s also unforgiving and unapologetic, with pockets of frustrating moments during which I was certainly not in my happy place. But by the end, Sifu offered me a nearly unparalleled sense of mastery and accomplishment, and I can’t imagine that I would’ve enjoyed it half as much if it pulled its punches. Sifu begins, as so many revenge-fueled martial arts stories do, with a murder. Your father and martial arts master is killed right before your eyes in what is quite simply one of the best prologue chapters I’ve played in recent memory. It both serves as an excellent tutorial, and a teases at what the future holds for you as you have full access to the entire catalog of unlockable moves. Eight years later, you set off on a journey to kill each of the five people involved. It’s a very simple premise but it’s executed wonderfully. You begin with very little information about your targets, but over the course of the campaign you start to piece together who they are and what they’re all about by collecting clues and evidence throughout each level. I found myself uniquely motivated to seek out each of them, not only because of the additional lore and context about the main character’s quest for vengeance that they provided, but also because finding one could potentially unlock doors in previous levels that would lead to entirely new sections. Plus, the way new information is added to a detective board that shows how everything is connected is a nice touch. Sifu’s martial arts combat is among the best I’ve ever played, plain and simple. The camera does sometimes get squished in the corner and makes it hard to see what’s coming, but apart from that it’s hard to find many faults. I can’t say enough good things about how smooth the animation is, how every hit lands with bone-crunching impact (which is wonderfully emphasized by the DualSense controller’s haptics if you’re playing on PlayStation 5) and how every single counter looks natural no matter what angle an attack comes from or what type of strike is thrown. That’s just talking on a purely surface level; mechanically, it’s just as impressive. There are two attack buttons that you can go between for a variety of combos, each with their own specific function; a guard button for blocks, parries, and sways; a button for vaulting over objects in the environment; a button to pick up weapons; a button to throw weapons; and a focus button that lets you use a variety of unblockable special attacks with their own effects, all tied to a focus meter. While the hand-to-hand fisticuffs are great, Sifu really sets itself apart from other beat-em-ups through its use of environmental combat. Stunned enemies can be thrown down stairs, through barricades, and even over railings for instant kills; weapons can be kicked up directly from the ground into a thug’s face; and there are all sorts of contextual takedowns that seamlessly incorporate your surroundings into their animations. More than just being really freaking cool, it all offers a strategic advantage as well, and some fights that initially seemed absolutely impossible to make it through unscathed became much more achievable once I took the time to explore the room and look for opportunities to use the environment to my advantage. But more than anything, it’s the defensive options that really make Sifu sing. Much like in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, there’s a “structure meter” that governs the guards of both you and your enemies. If you block too many hits the structure meter will break and you’ll be in for a bad time. To avoid that, you can hold down the block button and move the stick up or down to sway out of the way of either high or low attacks. Swaying is ideal for when you know an attack is the last hit of a combo, as it gives you an opportunity to counterattack and even opens the opponent up for a directional throw, but also comes with the risk of mistiming it or choosing the wrong direction. And finally, you can attempt to parry an attack by tapping the block button right when it’s about to hit. Parries are great because they will stop an opponent’s combo dead in its tracks and open them up for a counter attack or throw, but they require super precise timing, especially on the highly damaging power attacks that most bosses like to employ.  It’s great that the enemy AI in Sifu is aggressive enough to really force you to master these deep defensive mechanics. They do not just hang around and wait their turn – they will leap in with Superman punches, attempt to surround you, toss bottles from across the room, leap over bar counters and smash you with an axe kick, and just generally put up a very tough fight across all the levels. Sloclap finds this really nice balance where the enemies are just predictable enough where you can learn to recognize certain combos coming your way and plan a defense off that first hit, but there’s also just enough variation in their attack patterns where you could be caught off guard if you lose focus. On paper, Sifu is actually a very short game. Its five levels can be completed in just a handful of hours, even right from the first time you start a new save file. I would be very impressed if you actually managed to pull that feat off on your first playthrough (it took me about 10 hours to reach the end for the first time) but it isn’t impossible. More than likely, you will die along your quest, and the way Sifu handles death is truly unique: with the help of a magical talisman, you’ll be able to revive right from where you keeled over and continue fighting, but you’ll age up by however many years your current death counter is at. So while your first few deaths may only age you up by just one, two, or three years, if you continue dying to the same enemy or boss you’ll quickly find yourself aging by five, six, seven years or more each time you go down. The only way to decrease it is to defeat some specific (and tough) enemies, which naturally poses its own risks of making it go higher in the process. The aging isn’t just for show, either. Every time you age 10 years your maximum health will shrink but you’ll deal a little more damage, as your body becomes more frail but your skills and experience become sharper. Once you hit your 70s, the magic of your talisman will run out, and the next time you die, it’s game over. Here’s where things get tricky, though: You can restart a level and try again, but you’ll maintain the skills, age, and death counter of your best playthrough of the previous level. So if I barely scraped by against the boss of the second level at age 65 with a death counter of five or six, every time I restart the third level I will be 65 years old and only have two lives for the rest of the campaign (unless I manage to dramatically reduce my death counter, which is not easy to do). Obviously, not an ideal scenario. Basically, what that means is that it’s not enough to just beat a level – you need to beat the level and have enough of a lifespan leftover so that you can realistically tackle everything after it. This is the one pain point in Sifu’s design: similar to a roguelike, it demands that you replay levels repeatedly until you’re able to basically master them. But unlike a roguelike, there’s no procedural level generation or randomized loot to alleviate some of the repetition involved with playing the same levels over and over again. You always have the same weapons, the same enemies, and the same bosses to contend with. That isn’t to say I would have prefered procedural levels, because Sifu’s hand-crafted ones are bursting at the seams with creativity and style, especially at the points where each level leaves the confines of reality and ventures into the realm of the surreal. However, the emphasis on repeated playthroughs feels at odds with how static everything is, resulting in some tiring repetition. Mercifully, there are shortcuts you can unlock on subsequent playthroughs, so you will rarely ever have to play an entire level over again. In one particular stage you’re actually pretty much able to beeline straight to the boss once you’ve fought her for the first time. But in other cases, like the second level in particular, you’ll still have to play through 10 to 20 minutes before you even get a chance to attempt the boss again. I know that all sounds bad, and it surely was a substantial hump that I needed to clear – but once I did, I truly fell in love with the masterful combat and moment-to-moment gameplay of Sifu. Not to mention the excellent dynamic soundtrack, the cool ways it uses ambient noises from the controller’s speakers, and its gorgeous watercolor art style. You begin Sifu with all the skills you’ll need get to the end: a handful of basic combos, a sweep that can knock enemies down, a grab against grounded foes that lets you deal two quick strikes and them pick them back up on their feet, a push that shoves enemies away from you, and an eye-poking focus attack. In addition to those basic skills, though, every time you die – or every time you find a shrine that offers a number of buffs you can purchase for that run – you get an opportunity to add new skills to your repertoire to give you some situational advantages. That includes options like the ability to catch incoming projectiles, a counterattack that can be used while you’re on the ground, or a ducking strike that lets you slip under a high attack to punch an enemy straight in the crotch. The catch is that when it’s game over, all of your skills reset to zero. There is some roguelite-style persistent progression, though, in that you can make a skill a permanent fixture on your loadout once you’ve bought it a total of six times. So you need to make a choice on any given run about whether you want to spend your points doubling down on a skill that you really want for future playthroughs, or spread your experience around to give yourself the best possible chance on that particular run. I find myself torn on this, because on the one hand I do think it’s a well designed progression system given Sifu’s unique take on death and its focus on replaying its levels. But at the same time, most of the skills are so situational that I often found myself spending hard earned XP on a skill that I never got an opportunity to use, or a skill that never really provided any sort of new solution for a problem I was facing at the time. Having that duck-and-groin-punch move is cool, but it feels redundant when I can already duck under attacks and counterattack to stun an enemy. There are a handful of exceptions, but many other skills follow suit in that they are cool attacks that aren’t really any more useful than your core set of abilities. Sifu demands a lot from you, and that’s a sword that cuts both ways. Its combat is impeccable, with incredibly smooth and impactful animation, deep fighting mechanics, and challenging enemies that really make you fight tooth and nail for every victory. At the same time, the repetition that comes from replaying levels so you can essentially set a high score and give yourself a chance at completing the rest of the short campaign with what’s effectively one persistent pool of lives can lead to some really frustrating moments with no clear path through outside of just trying and trying until you get better at it, which can be frustrating. On the other side of that vicious learning curve, though, is one of the most impressive beat-em-ups I’ve ever played, with excellent level design, fantastic music, and – once it was all over – a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction that few other video games can provide. "
168,Dying Light 2 Stay Human ,7.0,"The weird, surreal tone of Dying Light 2 Stay Human combines very serious end-of-days themes with silly characters and minigames that have you smacking zombies off a skyscraper with a cricket bat is bizarre, but somehow it works extremely well. This zombie-smashing action game is a strong post-apocalyptic adventure with top-tier parkour movement, an expansive open world in which to put them to good use, and lots of great characters. What doesn’t work so well is how it combines a near-lethal case of bugs with a story centered around a protagonist so uninteresting that he’s all but (un)dead on arrival. I’m sure that when the developers at Techland set out to make this sequel they had no idea that they’d end up releasing a game about a global pandemic two years into a global pandemic, but it’s clear that trying to finish such an ambitious game under these conditions didn’t do it any favors. Sticking largely to the plan laid out by its surprise-hit predecessor in 2015, Dying Light 2 takes place in an excellent, highly explorable city where the rooftops are home to eccentric survivors who have become masters of parkour, scavenging, and chopping zombie heads off with assorted sporting equipment. By day the zombies swarms crowd into buildings to hide from the sun, and by night they pour into the streets in daunting masses, but the real tension comes from managing the terrifying meter that counts down to you transforming into a brainless shambler. Like nearly everyone else you’re infected with the zombie virus, and staying in near-constant contact with UV rays is the only thing delaying the inevitable. The ever-present need to recharge that meter – which will deplete in a matter of minutes if you’re inside a building away from the light – is an excellent addition to Dying Light’s moment-to-moment gameplay that keeps up the pressure on every step of your journey.  During the night you have to be extremely deliberate with everything you do so you can make it back to a nearby oasis with UV lights to replenish your meter, like a diver with a limited oxygen supply. Do you risk looting every corner of a mission area or rush through and complete the main objective to mitigate danger? Should you take the time to sneak around to avoid conflict or would it be easier to press the attack and risk getting stabbed to reach a goal faster? Decisions like this layer on top of the action and give you something to think about beyond just splattering the nearest zombies and looting their corpses. The distinct feel to each part of the day-night cycle creates a balance in what types of things you’ll get up to: you’ll need to spend nights delving into abandoned subway stations, power plants, and hospitals to gather new weapons and crafting materials, completing missions along the way; by day you travel through the city and complete story missions outdoors unless you absolutely have to go inside.  Your biggest asset in this – and the biggest highlight of Dying Light 2, by a mile – is its liberating and smooth parkour system, which improves upon the first game’s already impressive toolbox. You’ll leap from building to building, scale skyscrapers, and even swing around with a grappling hook with intuitive ease.  Since the city streets are flooded with the undead by night and not-yet-dead bandits by day, sticking to rooftops quickly becomes one of the most intricate and high-stakes games of “The Floor is Lava” of all time – and it’s consistently entertaining even when you’re just running from point A to point B. As you level up, a repertoire of over 20 unlockable parkour skills allows you to navigate the city in new ways, including running on walls, sliding under tight spaces, and – if you’re really in a tight spot – springboarding off the heads of zombies to get away. Once I escaped from the top of a skyscraper by grabbing a zombie, jumping off the roof, and riding him all the way down until he softened my fall at the bottom. Another time I escaped a horde of zombies by wallrunning on the sides of skyscrapers as the dummies that pursued me leapt to their depths. There just aren’t many games that can hold a candle to the over-the-top, badass things you can pull off in Dying Light 2 .Later on there’s even a paraglider that makes rooftop travel possible in cityscapes where massive building height makes travel by foot difficult, and by that point it really felt like I had the freedom to go anywhere I wanted. Combat against humans and zombies alike can also be a lot of fun as you dropkick faces, dodge and parry attacks, and lop off arms, legs, and torsos. That said, when it comes to human opponents the AI leaves a lot of potential challenge on the table due to the fact that large groups don’t know how to gang up on you, allowing you to mostly parry and kill them off one at a time while their buddies sit back and help by shouting expletives at you. There also isn’t much variety in the types of human enemies you fight – just regular grunts and much beefier, slower enemies with big, two-handed weapons. Once you learn to parry and dodge the few attacks they have they’re never much of a threat, even on the hardest difficulty. I also didn’t feel all that imperiled while running around at night, even when I was being chased by tons of zombies. That was disappointing since the first Dying LIght had me sweating bullets anytime I had to go out after dark. Maybe it’s because Dying Light 2’s powerful skills and weapon options put those in the original Dying Light to shame, like modified weapons that can cause an explosion on a critical hit or light an enemy on fire for several seconds allowing you to pummel them to death while they’re defenseless. Or maybe it’s the fact that you can more easily over-level yourself in each area before moving to the next, making any new threats feel like pushovers. Maybe it’s a combination of those and other factors, but it wasn’t long before I could easily clear an entire warehouse of angry biters without breaking a sweat. That said, having a Howler sic an entire army of screaming zombies after you is still a stressful encounter, because they follow you everywhere you go (even on rooftops) and make going about your business normally nearly impossible, so they’re still a force to be reckoned with even if they rarely do you in.  Working in its favor, though, even when combat isn’t challenging there are so many fun options for finding inventive ways to kill a whole room of bandits or bloodthirsty brain-eaters that it’s rarely a tedious undertaking. Throwing giant exploding gas tanks at groups of enemies, setting a dozen zombies on fire with a well-placed molotov cocktail, or just walking up to them one at a time and drop kicking them out of a window are just a few ways I rid myself of unwanted undead. The variety among zombies in Dying Light 2 is, thankfully, a lot better than it is with the human enemies. There’s your run-of-the-mill, slow-moving lurches which are about as useless as you’d expect; the recently turned, fast-moving “Virals” that leap at you and make you curse in front of your kids take a little more agility to deal with; “Howlers,” which scream like maniacs and draw attention from all nearby zombies need to be dealt with quickly, and many more freakish beasts – including some terrifying bosses that can require some effort to take down. They’re certainly not the most difficult bosses ever, of course. Speaking of killing things, it’s almost entirely done up close and personal. You won’t find any guns in Dying Light 2 and ranged weapons in general are fairly rare (and often impractical, since bows have a low rate of fire). So most of the time you'll be hacking away with a wide assortment of melee weapons that run the gamut from samurai swords to brass knuckles to a metal pipe with a tin can on the end of it. Weapons come to you as randomly generated loot out in the world or as purchases from vendors at social hubs, but either way they have a limited number of uses before they deteriorate and eventually break. However, if you don’t care for having your trusty weapons crumble to ash in your hands, know that Dying Light 2 doesn’t force it on you as often as, say, Breath of the Wild. In fact, the best weapons can be modded to improve their durability, deal more damage or apply status effects, and can even be repaired a limited number of times to extend their use. In my experience, by the time a weapon finally broke on me, odds are it had already become too low-level for me to want to use it anyway. Besides which, you’re constantly replenishing your selection with better stuff as well, so it’s unlikely you’ll ever find yourself empty handed when you’re fending off a horde. If your tolerance for bugs is low, I do not recommend jumping into Dying Light 2 on day one. Or day 10. Maybe day 30? I was able to play it to completion, but only barely: leading up to launch it is absolutely drowning in a sea of upsetting technical issues, whether it’s crashing (which happened to me dozens of times in my more than 80 hours with it on Xbox Series X and to others at IGN on PlayStation 5 and PC), all dialogue stopping during cutscenes, all audio being replaced with a loud screeching noise, getting locked out of quests because a character won’t let you talk to him or being unable to finish because the objective never spawned in, uneven framerates making me seasick, and too many more to list here. Most glitches are temporary annoyances or even amusing wonkiness, but some are more dire – one IGN editor playing on PS5 had his entire save file corrupted, leaving him with a never-ending loading screen and locking him out of his save pending an upcoming patch.  Normally I expect a certain lack of polish in ambitious, open-world games, but even with my expectation for jankiness set to maximum, Dying Light 2 has been really, really rough. The longer I played, the more frequent the issues seemed to become; by the end I was having to quit out and reboot multiple times per hour, and breathed a huge sigh of relief when credits rolled and something hadn’t catastrophically broken my save file.  In terms of stability issues and the danger of losing progress, it’s been considerably more severe than our experience with the PC version of Cyberpunk 2077, where the bugs we hit were mostly visual in nature. Techland is aware of all of this and is reportedly hard at work on patches to address it, but if history is any indication it’s going to take more than a few real-world day-night cycles to sort out this many issues. After chasing down so many threads for so many hours, it was deflating that the main plot of Dying Light 2 ended up feeling so weak despite an embarrassment of riches when it comes to great characters. Rosario Dawson’s Lawan, for example, is a fantastic antihero you get to hang out with a lot as she broods, drinks, and kills people indiscriminately with a crossbow. Then there’s the washed-up former hero Frank, the charming ladies’ man Hakon, and many, many more who left me with fun and dramatic moments to remember them by. The real issue is that Dying Light 2 just has us kinda meander from character to character without any cohesive story materializing between them, mostly because the one thing that would connect falls flat thanks to the character with the most screen time of all: Aiden Caldwell (that’s you). Aiden (like so many other Aidens) is what you’d get if you ordered a cardboard cutout of a generic protagonist on Amazon and got the cheap knock-off version instead. The tale of revenge he’s on is confusing, cliche, and borders on the nonsensical by the end. Without going into spoilers, the flashbacks to Aiden’s mysterious and tragedy-filled backstory sprinkled throughout the campaign left me wondering when the other shoe will drop… but it never did. It’s especially irritating because there are so many interesting stories and well-written characters throughout the campaign, but for some reason your character is one of the dullest people on one of the most humdrum adventures among them. Beginning as a furtive, desperate survival-horror experience, Dying Light gradually and gratifyingly evolves into a fast, hyper-violent celebration of vertical freedom and zombie destruction. Its main story is unspectacular, but the memorable side quests and sheer fun of exploring its world do a fantastic job of offsetting that, making Dying Light one of the most engrossing open-world games – zombie-infested or otherwise – I've played in a while. That said, since Aiden is mostly along for the ride by involving himself in the lives of other characters, you spend a lot of your time hearing from people who are a lot more compelling. In the first act, for example, you’re caught in the middle of a dispute between two opposing factions involving an unsolved murder and suspicion on both sides. The egos and suspects you encounter along the way make taking sides a legitimately difficult choice between the lesser of two evils. It’s when Dying Light 2 thrusts you into the morally gray areas of this bleak future that the storytelling is at its best. Another disappointment is that most of the major decisions I made had little impact on the overall flow of the story, despite Dying Light 2 seemingly going out of its way to focus on your choices supposedly carrying weight. For example, I did everything in my power to piss off one of the city’s biggest and most powerful factions, even going so far as to unsubtly assassinate several of their leaders. I expected bigtime consequences… and yet, by the end of the story I still found myself working alongside them, even moments after I’d betrayed them for the third consecutive time. (Fool them once, shame on me. Fool them thrice…) For what it’s worth, they did give me a stern talking-to, but none of it had a whole lot of impact on where I ended up. Although my actions certainly changed some characters’ opinions of me and altered some story quests here and there, I ultimately still did all the same major story missions regardless of my decisions. Likewise, the ending felt like an inevitability, with only minor details changing along the way when I went back to check to see what might’ve gone differently. The biggest impact my free will had was that certain decisions led me to entirely different story quests and unlocked side quests that were specific to whichever faction I had sided with. Since I was such a heartless monster to one faction in particular, for example, someone in that faction almost got killed as a result of my shenanigans and was left comatose, which unlocked a mission for me to either cure him or take him out for good. (I had him killed, obviously – you don’t just leave a job half-done!) So it’s not that your decisions don’t have some immediate impact on how certain elements of the story plays out but, much like a Telltale game, you always end up in the same major events and don’t have much ability to change things in the grand scheme of the story. The results are simply typical and not very ambitious next to other games. Dying Light 2 also features a drop-in co-op mode (there’s no cross-platform play available, FYI) where up to four players can explore the city together and take on any activity, from story missions, to parkour minigames, to boss fights. It’s not only impressive that so much of the campaign can be enjoyed together, but it has just about every feature I could’ve asked for from a modern co-op game: There’s difficulty scaling to account from more people in the action, player-specific loot so you don’t fight with friends over weapon drops, and crucially, all progress, XP and story decisions carry across to your save file whether you’re the host or a guest.  The downside, as seems to be a running theme with Dying Light 2, is that there are some additional bugs and technical issues introduced when playing co-op. In my time playing with friends, I suffered framerate issues and occasional lag that wasn’t present in single-player as well as infrequent disconnects and technical hitches. Overall it seems that Techland is rapidly deploying fixes to improve the experience, but co-op seems to run at the very least slightly worse than playing solo (which has plenty of issues to begin with).  Another in a long series of big, ambitious games whose potential greatness is visible just beneath a grimey layer of bugs, Dying Light 2 Stay Human could very likely become the stellar zombie survival adventure it’s meant to be someday. For now, though, it’s best added to your backlog unless your irritation with crashes and technical issues is outweighed by eagerness to dance across rooftops with its excellent parkour, which – when everything works – is an unforgettable way to explore the last city’s open world and join in the post-apocalyptic stories of its many weird and distinctive characters. No patch can fix the forgettable main plot or the protagonist I couldn’t pick out of a police lineup even after 80 hours in his shoes, but Dying Light 2’s streets tell their own stories. "
169,Pokémon Legends: Arceus ,7.0,"Up until now, the ""main series"" Pokémon games have been strictly turn-based RPGs following a young protagonist on a quest to become a powerful Pokémon trainer. Each successive game has layered on a slate of new Pokémon to wrangle and, more recently, increasingly absurd and bloated mechanics to try and spice up a system that fundamentally remained unchanged. So at last, we have Legends: Arceus: the reinvention we asked for. Developer Game Freak has scrapped nearly everything I’ve come to expect from a typical Pokémon game — Gyms, random encounters, an Elite Four, trainer battles on the overworld, an evil team bent on world domination — and started over, rethinking even its most basic systems like Pokémon encounters and evolution from the ground up. A lot of this impressive transformation pays off, in that we get to interact with creatures that have never felt more alive in more dynamic ways, but Pokemon’s evolution is not yet complete, because the semi-open world around all of that feels like an unimpressive afterthought due to its bland emptiness. There are many and varied reasons why people come clamoring back to Pokemon year after year, but at the heart of it perhaps is the enjoyment derived from collecting a veritable army of interesting monsters, customizing and bonding with a specific team of powerful ones, and overcoming increasingly difficult challenges alongside them. In that regard, Legends: Arceus is still the Pokémon we know and love. But everything surrounding it — how you encounter these creatures and learn about them, how you fight against and alongside them, and the challenges you face together — has been flipped on its head.  The way Legends: Arceus completely reimagines how you go about capturing and battling Pokémon is exemplary. Pokémon wander the overworld as they did in Let's Go and Sword and Shield's Wild Area, but instead of touching them to start every fight, here you have a buffet of options for how to approach each encounter. You could, for instance, toss a PokeBall right away for a capture attempt, or send out one of your Pokémon for a battle, or play it safer and use items like berries to distract them or mud balls to stun them. Some Pokémon will flee the second they see you, requiring you to stealthily hide in tall grass to get a good shot in. Others might attack you directly – your actual character, not your Pokémon – and you’ll have to dodge-roll or take a hit to your limited health bar. Granted, this doesn’t sound like a radical idea if you’ve ever played an action game, but for Pokemon RPGs this level of real-time action and peril is a new and welcome change that properly casts Pokemon as the actual, dangerous critters they are. Tied in with this are many of Legends: Arceus' more impressive touches, specifically in how wild Pokémon react to you or simply exist in the world as actual creatures with distinctive behavioral quirks. For instance, Nosepass will always fall asleep facing north, Sudowoodo freeze in a tree pose when they think you've spotted them, and Magikarp will stupidly flop right up to you because they have no idea you're packing a team of level-80 behemoths that could eat 10 of them in a single bite. Not every Pokémon has this level of personality, but the many that do feel real in a way Pokémon haven't in any other main series game, if not quite at the levels of liveliness we saw in Pokémon Snap.  Even more thrilling are the occasional ""space-time distortions"" that appear across Legends: Arceus' five separate, self-contained biomes, bringing with them a bevy of rare and powerful Pokémon rapidly spawning in and out to create a scene of delightful chaos. And then there's the pure, delicious terror of running across a massive, red-eyed ""alpha"" Pokémon in the wild and having it chase you halfway across the map. Listen, you haven't really experienced Pokémon until a Chansey has blasted you straight into the ocean with a well-placed Hyper Beam. All of this makes the creatures of Hisui feel much more lively and dynamic than any previous game, though naturally it doesn’t approach the level of detail we see in something like Breath of the Wild. Battling, too, has received an overhaul that adds a new strategic layer to encounters, most noticeably with the addition of Strong and Agile attacks. If you've played any of the Bravely Default games, this will feel a bit familiar: aside from normal attacks, you can also opt to either sacrifice attack power to bring your turn back sooner with an Agile move, or give up future turns for an extra-powerful hit now. The system does fail in a couple ways, however: for one, most wild encounters are over so quickly that much of this isn't always worth bothering with. For another, the strategic element of sacrificing power for turns or turns for power doesn't work as well when either you or your opponent is switching Pokémon in and out constantly, forcing the turn order to shift and reset again and again. That makes it harder to strategize when you're getting your butt kicked by a powerful monster, and nigh impossible in trainer battles when you're both just one-shotting each other's Pokémon back and forth. On the whole it's a good idea, but the fights Legends: Arceus usually provides don't always allow it to shine. What works far better are the subtler changes to how different moves and status effects are used in battles. I won't go into all the details here, but if you've been a Pokémon fan for years, you'll immediately notice that moves like Rollout don't work the way you remember them, or that status effects like Sleep seem different from usual. The vast, vast majority of these changes are for the better, serving to tighten up battles and working well within the faster-paced, damage-heavy framework. Other major changes are noticeable outside of battle, too, with both evolving Pokémon and changing up their movesets now conveniently available directly from the menu as soon as certain requirements are met. No longer do you have to trek out to a Move Tutor and pay them in rare items to relearn older moves – every attack a Pokémon has ever learned is always available to swap in at any time outside of battle. Legends: Arceus also does away with series staples such as held items, breeding, eggs, and abilities, and doesn't have an equivalent to Mega Evolution Z-Moves, Gigantamaxing, or any of that other nonsense; it doesn't need it. It's not that Legends: Arceus isn't a complex game – far from it, in fact – but that complexity has been shifted into strategic approaches to encounters, capturing, and team building rather than an increasingly tall tower of systems layered atop one another. Pokémon Legends: Arceus takes place in the Pokémon world before many of the technologies and discoveries about Pokémon we’ve come to rely on in the main games were made. Your PokeDex, for instance, is styled as a hand-written notebook instead of a digital index. With no PCs to store Pokémon, you instead leave them in a pasture at Jubilife Village (though storage and withdrawal is still convenient and quick). Pokémon breeding and eggs hadn’t been discovered yet, so that system isn’t available; nor is it yet known that Pokémon can hold items. Trading Pokémon with others still exists both locally and online (though we didn’t get to test it), but Pokémon that would normally evolve by trading now evolve simply by using certain items you can find through normal play. The past was a simpler time, certainly, but in many ways it’s a lot more convenient! It doesn't hurt that Legends: Arceus is much more difficult than any Pokémon game in recent memory, especially when you combine the turn-based battle mechanics with the more action-oriented movement required to set them up in the first place. Wild Pokémon overall just seem to do more damage across the board, and even early on you can run across massively powerful Pokémon that will wreck your entire team and your character if you're not careful. In the first area, for instance, wandering down a particular path will put you right in the sights of a massive, red-eyed Rapidash at an unreasonably high level. You can run if you like, or try to catch it and risk losing, but there's no denying it's a sobering early moment for those who are used to Pokémon games being a cakewalk. This is a welcome removal of Pokemon's historical training wheels, especially for fans like me who have been craving more challenge from Pokémon for years. But it does lose a lot of the series' past accessibility as a result (and there’s no easy mode), which is worth keeping in mind given its wide-ranging, all-ages fanbase. There are plenty of good real-world reasons why Game Freak thought an overhaul was in order, but in the world of Legends: Arceus, battling and catching Pokémon is the way it is because you are, by and large, actively inventing both as you go. Rather than the usual plucky young pre-teen setting out on a gym challenge, you play as a modern-day teenager flung through time and space to a past version of the Sinnoh region from Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, known in its own time as Hisui. You're instructed by a mysterious voice to meet every Pokemon, and then dropped near a settlement called Jubilife Village, where Pokemon are known as terrifying creatures that humans must fear and avoid. This pleasantly surprising twist allows for a completely new perspective on the, frankly, quite frightening monsters we've been collecting for the last two decades, as you join an expedition team instructed to investigate the 242 different Pokémon that live in the region in an effort to help humans learn to live safely and peacefully alongside them. And what better way to do that than by compiling a PokeDex? Except this, too, is not the PokeDex we're familiar with. Beyond just catching every Pokémon once to complete the encyclopedia, you can only fully fill out an entry by completing a number of bonus tasks unique to each monster. Catching at least one is required, but other research tasks include things like battling a certain number, witnessing them using certain moves, encountering them in specific ways or at certain times, and more. For example, a Bidoof will be one of the first Pokemon you catch, but to fully research it you might catch multiple, evolve one into Bibarel, defeat several in battle, or finish a sidequest in Jubilife Village where a bunch of Bidoof are causing an annoyance. Such sidequests are available aplenty, and help the citizens of Jubilife work through their fears of the monsters they live alongside… and even learn to love them. If a good remake is defined by its loyalty to the original, then Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are very good remakes indeed. They are Diamond and Pearl down to nearly every detail, looking nicer than ever before with a few small tweaks, most of which are pretty good ones. It leaves in some of the original’s roster flaws, but they’re largely forgivable if you’re like me and have some degree of nostalgia for a time when Pokémon’s scope was smaller. And yet, I can’t help but be disappointed that Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl weren’t braver in how they improved upon the originals in the same way other Pokémon remakes were, bringing even some now-historic improvements back to correct history’s mistakes. Of course, I still had a perfectly pleasant time revisiting both Sinnoh and the simultaneously simpler yet more challenging era of Pokémon that took place within it reminded me of a time when this series asked a bit more of us. Filling out the PokeDex improves your rank in the expedition team, which is required for certain progression milestones and rewards, but it's also a wonderfully fulfilling task on its own because it's so open-ended. I often found myself wandering off from the main story path into forests, caves, mountains, and rivers looking for new monsters to catalog, watching them move, and spending time getting to know them so I could discern how best to tackle each new research task. When combined with the new capturing and battling systems, Pokémon Legends: Arceus' main loop of visiting a new area, working on the PokeDex, turning in progress, and repeating proved fun and enticing for hours on end. But fun as it was to catch and catch and catch Pokémon, Legends: Arceus' brilliant new systems come with a major downside: they all exist within an ugly, empty world. Now that the Switch has multiple lovely, stylized open-world games with big grassy fields and roaming monsters, this particular world comes off as especially disappointing. With the singular exception of its pleasant skies, it's just not nice to look at, ever. Its five areas, which include the Obsidian Fieldlands, the Crimson Mirelands, and the Cobalt Coastlands often look depressingly similar to one another. Textures are ugly and repetitive, grass and trees are excessively simple and obvious, and the water effects are utterly bizarre, especially when Pokémon are swimming. Objects pop in and out at close range, and large wild Pokémon spotted in the distance run at an agonizingly slow framerate that makes them look like stop-motion animations. And to be very clear, none of this is a rarity – it looks like this constantly, in both docked and handheld mode (though handheld is a bit better), and often kills the immersion of running around what should be an exciting natural world stuffed with Pokémon. If anything, it looks worse the further you get: when you begin to unlock Pokémon that enable you to gallop, surf, and fly over the world rapidly, the visual disappointments – and the awkwardly placed, artificial barriers at the world's edges – become even more obvious and difficult to look past. What's more, while Arceus' overworld is massive in size, so much of it is functionally empty. Sure, the lore explains that the Hisui region is still largely uninhabited by humans, so it makes sense not to have tons of massive, bustling cities. But when I say empty, I mean empty, even of interesting natural phenomena or roadside curiosities. I cannot emphasize enough how much of this world is just long stretches of grass patches or bare, empty mountains covered in Geodudes, especially in the later areas. It's just all Pokémon, all the way down. There are a number of map-named places referencing towns or landmarks in Diamond and Pearl that are clearly intended to be their precursors but, aside from maybe having a few extra flowers or trees or slightly differently colored grass, there's little reason to really explore or appreciate them. Just catch your Pokémon and be on your way, nothing to see here. The handful of landmarks Hisui does have are frequently disappointing, too. So, so often in Legends: Arceus I saw what I thought might be a cool mountain cave or interesting ravine or island, only to find it inhabited by more of the same Combee and Buizels I'd been bumping into since I got to Hisui. A couple of small settlements parked around the region have absolutely nothing to offer beyond a sidequest or two – you can't even use them as camps to heal your team. Even the music that backs up your adventure is lackluster and oddly inconsistent, fading in and out at odd times and featuring a mix of calming Breath of the Wild-style piano melodies and energetic remixes of Diamond and Pearl route themes. Essentially, exploring and getting to know Hisui is entirely about cataloging its Pokémon – the region, world, music, and landscape itself is an underdressed, inelegant afterthought. Even worse, without interesting landmarks, Hisui is also entirely devoid of anything resembling dungeons, or even puzzles, really. There's one sort-of dungeon about 20 hours in with a couple of extremely basic shape-memorization puzzles, but then you never see anything like it again. Part of this is likely due to the fact that riding on Pokémon has entirely replaced the old system of ""Hidden Machine"" moves usable for both traveling and puzzle solving on the overworld. While I welcome not having to carry a Bidoof with me at all times to break rocks, Legends: Arceus feels like it lost a little too much of itself without cool ruins puzzles to solve or interesting spelunking trips. With no suitable replacement for the traditional gyms, Rocket hideouts, and the like, there's no meaningful build-up to major encounters and no moments of satisfaction that come from surviving a long excursion into a dangerous place with a powerful enemy at the end. I didn't realize how much adrenaline conquering something like a Victory Road really gave me until it was suddenly missing. What all this means is that what you're doing for almost the entirety of Legends: Arceus' first act is catching and battling, over and over again. And that system is strong enough that it does manage to keep things interesting most of the way, though admittedly after the first 20 or so hours of repetition I was starting to flag. Interspersed boss fights with powerful lord and lady Pokémon that actively mix up the action game mechanics of their battles help freshen things up, though I could have done with a few more actually challenging trainer battles than the story threw at me. But then I reached Legends: Arceus' ending…or should I say endings? When you see credits roll about 30 hours in, the “ending” you’ve seen is really more of an act one finale, leading directly into a robust second half with 20 or 30 additional hours of sidequests, battles, legendaries, and more. That on its own is great, and a lot of that extra content is pretty fun, too, including a seriously tough boss battle and some excellent legendary Pokémon hunts and fights that really make use of Legends: Arceus' overworld creature-catching and item-use mechanics for interesting, strategic encounters. In fact, they made me wish more of the earlier Pokémon encounters had forced me to make better use of my toolset for stealth and stunning – those felt like missed opportunities in hindsight.  But one massive piece of Legends: Arceus' second half sucks: finishing it. The actual, for-real ending is gated behind two absolutely massive and frustrating collect-a-thons. One of the tasks is to collect 107 of an item scattered across all six zones, with absolutely no guide as to where any of them are beyond the number remaining in each area. The other task is, unsurprisingly, capturing every Pokémon available – a job made agonizing by the fact that many are extremely rare. At one point, I spent several hours doing the following: leaving Jubilife Village for a certain area, flying to the very specific spawn point of a Pokémon I needed, seeing it was not there, warping back to camp, going back to the village to reset the spawns, and repeating until I found what I needed. I similarly spent hours sitting on a mountaintop, waiting for a space-time-distortion to appear in hopes that it might, maybe, have the Pokémon I needed. And if I accidentally made any of these Pokémon faint or flee, too bad. Do it all over again. This is so, so far removed from the Pokémon fantasy I wanted to see the series evolve into. I understand that Pokémon has always had these kinds of obtuse, repetitive challenges for its rarest monsters (remember Feebas in Ruby and Sapphire?), but never have they been required to achieve a main story ending – not even back in the good ol' days where catching 'em all was still the slogan. And given the modern reinvention of the series we see here, this sort of tedious mandatory activity should’ve been the first thing to be discarded. If Legends: Arceus had hidden more of these rarer monsters behind puzzles or interesting sidequests or actual overworld mysteries, that would have been one thing. Instead, it's just a lot of waiting, repetition, and luck (and, for everyone else playing it post-launch, presumably online guides) that I found immensely discouraging despite the enticing proposition of, you know, actually getting some form of resolution to the plot established in the first five minutes. On the bright side, online and local trading will be available at launch, which may speed up this process for some, but that doesn’t change the annoying nature of being told to go out and find something that’s just not there to be found the vast majority of the time. So what awaits at the end of all this? I won't spoil it, but suffice to say it involves one admittedly fantastic, memorable boss battle, and then nothing. The story never really resolves. Multiple characters repeatedly hinted to have suspicious and interesting motives never explain who they are or what they're really up to. One particularly tragic character never even gets an acknowledgment that his unresolved story is actually pretty messed up for a Pokemon game, much less a happy ending (or any ending, really). Questions raised early on in Legends: Arceus are never answered sufficiently, and even when you get back to town, no one remarks on the feat you've just accomplished. Maybe it was my own fault for being led to believe that there was some greater story being told here beyond ""catch 'em all."" But after 64 hours, it was a wildly disappointing payoff for the work of finishing the longest main story a Pokemon game has ever had, even if the journey to get there was a lot of fun. I am left feeling torn about Pokémon Legends: Arceus. On the one hand, its revamped systems are utterly revolutionary to the franchise. It sheds both stale battle mechanics and an outdated progression system that sorely needed a shake-up, and the new replacements are incredibly fun even after hours of repetition. But while Legends: Arceus is the closest Pokémon has ever been to reflecting the monster catching and battling as I always imagined them in my head as a child, its otherwise exciting attempt at a genre-shift is set in a disappointingly empty, ugly, and at times tedious world. While I'm thrilled by this new gameplay direction, I wish the same care and attention was put into every aspect of the adventure. Pokémon Legends: Arceus is the best it’s ever felt to catch and collect Pokémon, but that level of ambition and brilliance deserved a better house to live in. Pokemon Legends: Arceus "
170,Century: Age of Ashes ,7.0,"An itch I didn’t know needed scratching was a dogfighting flight game where instead of controlling some boring starfighter or airplane, I get to ride a fire-breathing dragon into battle. Century: Age of Ashes flies in to deliver some magnificent scaly reptiles torching each other with fire vomit, which always made me laugh hysterically until someone did the same to me. That part was less funny but still looked cool. It’s a bit short-lived due to the tiny number of maps and a glaring balance problem for its main mode, but this free-to-play, dragon-centric dogfighter largely succeeds in fulfilling the fantasy of riding atop the most legendary of flying beasts. Age of Ashes is a team-based competitive multiplayer game where you take on enemies on dragonback, which is up there with the greatest game premises of all time, so we’re off to an excellent start. Flying around and breathing fire on your rivals is almost never not fun, due in no small part to the excellent flying mechanics and clever level design that has you ducking around castles, flying through tunnel shortcuts, and turning on a dime to give your pursuers the slip like no airplane ever could.  Burning enemies to a crisp is made all the more enjoyable by the fact that Age of Ashes is just absolutely beautiful to look at. Dragons are colorful and detailed, and navigating them through each of the four elaborate fantasy arenas is stunning. There are three dragonrider classes, each with a unique role and set of abilities, though sadly they’re not all created equal. My personal favorite, the Windguard, is a support character who can heal and buff her allies and leave a trail of poisonous fog in her wake to harm and blind pesky followers. Unfortunately, she also tends to be the most underused since her abilities are fairly situational and plenty of attacks can take a dragon down in no time at all, which makes healing feel pretty useless. The Marauder, meanwhile, is your standard murder-focused class that’s all about dealing damage and can enter a rage that lets him rain a ton of fireballs on enemies in a matter of seconds (one of those abilities that makes healing irrelevant). He’s a well-rounded character and a great option if you need a break from strategy and just want to beat the enemy into submission with brute force. Finally there’s the Phantom, the stealth-ambush class that has the annoyingly good abilities to become invisible, deal extra damage when striking as a surprise attack, and set traps in the form of explosive mines. In my time with Age of Ashes, most lobbies were filled with ~60% Phantoms – sometimes even higher – especially in the Ranked playlist. It’s just really hard to beat invisibility, especially in the sole ranked objective mode that has you collecting gold coins to store in your vault for points. I can’t count the number of times I was hot on someone’s tail as they fled with their gold, only for them to vanish and sneak away to their base. There’s just no counter for that, and it means that Phantoms are so good at this that you won’t see too much of the other two classes until there’s a nerf to balance the (dragon)scales. Century: Age of Ashes is a free-to-play game that offers microtransactions to unlock cosmetics and XP boosters that help with level progression. If you’re interested in customizing your character and unlocking some awesome-looking dragons, your dollar goes quite a long way, as even the $5 starter pack gives you 800 “gems,” which is more than you need to unlock some truly badass stuff. As is typical of the genre, most content can be earned in-game by grinding silver coins, but doing so takes hours of grinding. XP boosts can also be purchased, but only help you progress along the battle pass-like progression system that also only unlocks cosmetics. My personal favorite items available are the dragon eggs, which are cheaper than buying fully grown dragons outright (~$8 vs. ~$14, typically) and give you something to chase as you complete challenges to hatch and grow your dragon to maturity. At the time of this writing, there are no items in-game that give paying players an advantage over free players and, although the grind can be pretty oppressive for free players hoping to unlock cool cosmetics, none of it impacts the game itself in a meaningful way. Have at it, freeloaders! That said, even if the Phantom is irritatingly dominant, all three classes are a blast to play and the variety between them forces you to adapt your playstyle to make the most of each character's unique abilities, especially in the two objective-based game modes where more than brute strength and quick kills is required to claim victory. I absolutely love creating a thick cloud of poisonous fog behind my teammate carrying the flag in Gates of Fire, forcing the enemies in our rearview break off pursuit. And going berserk as the Marauder is a great way to take out enemies just in the nick of time in a close kill-based match. Speaking of game modes, Age of Ashes has four in total – Skirmish, Carnage, Gates of Fire, and Spoils of War – and they all have the potential to be great once the balance is worked out. Skirmish and Carnage are mostly the same in that they’re both straight-up street fights where the most kills wins, only Skirmish is 3v3 while Carnage is the standard size of 6v6. Both are entertaining dragon bloodsports where each kill you get puts a bigger bounty on your head that gives the enemy more points for taking you down, but there’s understandably not much to them aside from just freeform combat. Gates of Fire, on the other hand, is an original take on capture the flag where teams compete to gain control of a flag and carry it through a set of gates before its stolen and claimed by the enemy team. Success requires much more teamwork, and the back and forth is usually fierce to the very end of each round since completing a single lap without losing control of the flag to win the round outright is quite hard to pull off! Lastly there’s Spoils of War, which can be played in the social playlist but is also that singular game mode used in the ranked playlist where you hunt down gold-carrying, bot-controlled dragons to steal their loot and deposit it into your vault. It’s a simple enough premise, but made more complex by a bunch of interesting mechanics like the ability to steal the enemy’s vault key so they can’t deposit their gold – or, if you manage to grab a bomb that spawns on the map and carry it to the enemy team’s base you can blow it up, sending their hard-won gold flying all over the place to be stolen. Spoils of War definitely does the heavy lifting in Age of Ashes, as it’s got the most depth and strategy involved, but again, it’s so tilted toward Phantoms right now that I wouldn’t recommend going near it if you prefer a different class. Although all four game modes, three classes, and four maps are a blast, once you’ve played them all you’ve more or less seen all Age of Ashes currently has to offer. There just isn’t much in the way of variety at the moment, especially since Spoils of War only has one map. If you plan on climbing the ranked playlist, you’ll be playing the same game mode on the same map over and over again, and that got stale for me after about 10 hours of fun. The only other thing to do was repeat the same content to grind out the 100 battle pass-like player levels to unlock cosmetics and in-game currency that’s used to buy even more cosmetics and XP boosts. Another common irritation with Age of Ashes is the fact that its matchmaking doesn’t seem to take your region into account, so I’ve often ended up playing against players on the other side of the planet. As you might expect, this creates some lag that’s unpleasant to experience – there’s really nothing worse than dragons teleporting around the map when you’re trying to track them down. Hopefully matchmaking will add some geographical filtering in the near future to mitigate this issue – though I imagine that will require more people to give it a shot and stick around. It should be said that the cosmetics in Age of Ashes are pretty awesome. They include new looks and weapons for your dragon rider, titles and emblems to personalize your online persona, and best of all: different dragons. I’m a big fan of the Sarghildian Squall, a green dragon that looks like something out of Jurassic Park or Aelion, somehow resembling a massive, angry, reptilian cockatiel. Some are unlocked in their adult form via in-game effort or making a purchase, but the more interesting dragons are acquired as eggs and must be hatched into baby dragons and then cared for into adulthood. This is by far the most interesting progression system Age of Ashes offers, as hatching a dragon and raising it to maturity requires completing a series of challenges before the dragon can at last be taken into battle. Sadly, getting eggs is a bit of a grind unless you’re prepared to spend money, and most of the time I spent playing I didn’t have any eggs in my nest to work towards. Century: Age of Ashes is a really enjoyable PvP aerial combat game with some excellent game modes, unique character classes, and lots of beautiful, fierce dragons to collect and ride into battle. It could benefit from hoarding more content since its handful of maps can become stale after a dozen hours or so, and it desperately needs some balancing tweaks and more options for its ranked playlist to prevent one class from dominating, but it already has the makings of a very strong dogfighting game with enough dragons to make the Dovahkiin proud. "
171,Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon ,8.0,"Shovel Knight is everywhere these days. He’s in fighting games, rhythm games, 3D platformers, 2D platformers, and so much more, but a puzzle game is certainly new for the blue-clad shovelrous knight. Enter Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon, a wonderful spin-off of the Shovel Knight series that manages to successfully merge the characters, villains, and enemies of the classic 2D platformer with finely tuned puzzle and roguelite mechanics that make it hard to put down. Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon is a block-matching-puzzle-adventure-roguelite, which I know sounds like I just reached into a bucket, pulled out a handful of unrelated genres, and mashed them together – but somehow developers Vine and Yacht Club Games managed to make this concoction work. It’s simple on the surface: you control Shovel Knight or one of 12 other playable characters and move them around a 8x8 grid in four directions, while blocks and a rogue’s gallery of Shovel Knight enemies drop from the heavens like tetrominos in Tetris. It’s all very simple and intuitive: You can clear enemies and blocks by moving into them to attack, but every time you make an attack you also take damage equal to that enemy’s offensive stat, with the key exception being if your attack is a killing blow on your target. All of this to the tune of an incredible soundtrack that consists almost entirely of modern arrangements of the classic Shovel Knight soundtrack, with a couple of awesome new tracks for the new knights as well.  Where things get “puzzley” is when you attack an enemy that is adjacent to others of the same type: you only take damage from the one you’re hitting, but you deal damage to the whole chain, which lets you clear entire rows and columns of enemies in just a few strikes. Since you can only take so many attacks from individual enemies, it's paramount that you seek out these opportunities to clear large groups at once. Fortunately, if you start to run low on health, you can also find life restoring potions that will restore two hearts a piece. It’s an incredibly well-crafted design for a puzzle game and facilitates a ton of different approaches to each level. You could play it slow and focus on optimizing your chains while being extra cautious about your life, even though you run the risk of taking too long and letting the stack of enemies fill up to an unmanageable level; or you could play it fast and focus on smaller chains done quickly, at the risk of making a careless mistake by bumping into an enemy you don’t have the HP to deal with. In general, playing it safe will get you far, but you are rewarded for keeping your pace up, too. There’s a gem meter that fills while you’re clearing enemies and obstacles and rapidly depletes when you’re not. Filling up the gem meter will grant you a multiplier that will increase the amount of gems you collect by defeating enemies, and those gems can be spent in a shop on powerful relics with effects that range from increasing your life to having each of your attacks poison enemies or making you immune to hazards like slime, fire, and ice. But Pocket Dungeon’s real genius lies in its variety of playable characters. Picking a new knight is much more than just a cosmetic choice – it can completely change the rules. For instance, Specter Knight takes damage when he hits a potion and can only restore health by defeating enemies; Propeller Knight is incredibly good when it comes to defeating lone foes but is actively punished when he tries to chain them together; and my personal favorite, Black Knight, starts with a measly three HP but has the incredibly powerful special ability to turn his gem meter into extra attack power. That means he’s able to kill most enemies in just one hit if you’re able to get your gem meter up to x2 or x3, but the catch is that he loses that buff and is back to just dealing one damage as soon as you use a potion. That element of high-risk, high-reward, and fast paced play is right up my alley. In just about every case, each of the 12 knights has a completely distinct style of play. Even about 20 hours in, I’m still going back and attempting to reach the end of a run with every knight at least once – not out of a sense of completion, but because each playthrough is fun in its own way and requires a unique mastery of that specific knight’s special skills and quirks. In Pocket Dungeon’s main adventure mode you work your way through a series of 10 levels, nearly all of which are based on levels from the original Shovel Knight and feature the same enemies you’d normally encounter there. The Plains is stacked with Beetos, Blorbs, and Boneclangs; the Iron Whale is home to the durable Hermittacks; and the Clockwork Tower is full of conveyor belts and Electrodents that will quickly make you second guess attacking them twice in succession. There’s an excellent variety of enemies that really keep your synapses firing as you carefully consider how much damage each enemy will do, what their response will be once you attack them, and whether or not you have the health needed to defeat them before they take you out. It can be fairly brutal starting out when you don’t know all their nuances, but once you’re a couple of runs deep and you start to immediately recognize what each of them does, it’s extremely satisfying to just act without having to sit next to an enemy and read their description.  Adventure mode is structured like a roguelite, which means you have to restart from the first level if you die but keep some persistent progression. While this framework makes sense in the way that it encourages repeated runs, its progression elements feel a little half-baked. Similar to games such as Dead Cells and Enter the Gungeon, you unlock relics that are added to the randomized pool of potential items that appear in future runs. But although this system works wonderfully in those games, here it’s much less effective for a number of reasons. For one, none of the unlockable relics really make things any easier or contribute to a feeling of making any sort of progress. I actually found Pocket Dungeon easier to beat before I started unlocking any relics because the most universally useful ones – like the only two relics that give you more health, and one that gives you +1 damage on your first strikes – are part of the starting 15, and thus every relic added to the pool made the chances of getting those slightly worse. I still kept coming back to Adventure Mode even with these slight disappointments, though, because unlocking new characters by first beating them as bosses was always a thrill, and the “true ending” was a fun challenge to strive for. Pocket Dungeon also has a Daily Challenge that gives you one chance per day to set a high score with a particular character – but more substantially, it has a fun versus mode that lets you go toe-to-toe against either the challenging AI or a friend via local multiplayer. It’s structured very similarly to adventure mode in that, even though you’re competing against a friend and dropping garbage blocks on them by clearing chains, you’re also moving through different levels and buying a relic using your gems in between them. It’s such a fun mode that I can’t help but feel a little disappointed that it doesn’t have online play, or at the very least a more structured gauntlet mode tied to it that lets you challenge the whole roster in increasingly difficult fights. The folks at Yacht Club Games continue their streak of hits when it comes to Shovel Knight. As a puzzle game Pocket Dungeon treads familiar ground, but does so in a way that feels completely unique, whether as a fan of Shovel Knight, roguelites, or block-falling games. Some of the roguelite elements feel underdeveloped, and an online versus mode really would have pushed it over the top, but even with those minor shortcomings, this is yet another excellent entry in the world of Shovel Knight.

172,Halo Infinite Single-Player Campaign ,9.0,"Halo Infinite’s single-player campaign, like a new generation of Master Chief’s MJOLNIR armor, powers up a 20-year-old series, by both returning to its roots and blazing new trails to build off of. By shifting to an open-world map while retaining the classic gameplay both on foot and in its iconic vehicles, it offers a level of freedom in combat not seen in any prior Halo game. There’s a lot to do in this expansive playground, and completing its never-dull-or-overwhelming list of activities earns more combat options and, ultimately, more fun. It doesn’t quite recapture the environmental variety or memorable story of the original trilogy, but it’s still a thrilling return to form for one of gaming’s most beloved series, and for Master Chief himself. The change from the traditional linear series of combat arenas to letting you freely explore the Zeta Halo ring where Infinite takes place marks the first time developer 343 Industries has broken from the blueprint that Bungie drew 20 years ago. All of that space proves to be a natural fit for what’s always been a sort of sandbox-style shooter at heart, where unexpected things happen. In Infinite, that same thing is true on a grander scale.  But you aren’t dropped straight onto the ring and set loose. Instead, the first couple of the 25 hours I spent completing it on Heroic difficulty take place indoors, and that intro works well as a way to get acquainted with Halo’s literal new gameplay hook, the Grappleshot, as well as the first of many delightfully challenging bosses. And sure, the Grappleshot might feel quite familiar if you’ve played games like Just Cause or Titanfall, but it feels right at home in Halo. This fantastic tool can be used to grab weapons from afar, escape dire combat encounters when your depleted shields are screaming at you for a recharge, or launch you directly into the bad guys for a finishing melee attack with your full weight behind it. It’s a natural extension of the equipment idea introduced in Halo 3 – and that’s part of why Infinite’s moment-to-moment gameplay feels most like a cross between Halo 1 and Halo 3, which is very much a good thing. Meanwhile, the bosses make up many of Infinite’s best encounters, excluding those that you organically create for yourself out in Zeta Halo’s sandbox. The first, against the Banished Brute lieutenant Tremonius, showcases extra-challenging AI that will require you to keep your wits about you, not just extra ammo in your back pocket. He uses a jetpack as well as a lightning-quick ground-pound attack that will rock you if you’re not ready for it. It’s your first indication that each boss fight will keep you on your toes, and in total, Infinite features Halo’s best implementation of them yet. This warm-up serves as ample prep for the open world, and when you get out there, that’s when the Halo 1 feeling kicks in. You’ll need to get around on foot at first, and thus learning to grapple onto trees or into the ground ahead of you to propel yourself onward becomes the most fun way to navigate the world. You’ll encounter all sorts of opportunities to get into trouble on Zeta Halo, from rescuing groups of captured UNSC Marines to taking down propaganda radio towers to infiltrating massive Banished strongholds to reclaiming UNSC Forward Operating Bases (FOBs). While there’s nothing that feels wholly original here relative to games like Far Cry or Just Cause, the feature fits Halo in a very natural way, and the tasks are both varied enough and not so frequently repeated as to ever feel monotonous or annoying. But, in the grand tradition of Grand Theft Auto 3, you can’t go everywhere straight off the bat. Instead, Zeta Halo unlocks section by section, with key story missions opening up new lands to explore – though I do wish those new lands had a bit more variety. Or really, any variety at all. There’s no snowy area like in Combat Evolved, no urban area like in Halo 2 (or in Infinite’s own multiplayer maps like Streets and Bazaar, for that matter), or really… anything other than the mix of forest and stone monoliths. It’s as if 343 didn’t take its artistic inspiration from the whole of Halo 1, it took it specifically from “The Silent Cartographer” and nowhere else. That’s a bit disappointing, especially after a couple dozen hours. On a related note, I also wish Zeta Halo was a bit prettier. Halo games, like many major first-party efforts, have often been graphical showcases for their respective consoles – including 343’s own Halo 4, which elicited a late-in-the-generation “How did they do this on the 360?” kind of reaction to its gorgeous graphics back in 2012. While Infinite’s indoor spaces did wow me at times and there are certainly some impressive vistas across its outdoor landscape, Infinite looks perfectly good at best, but not jaw-droppingly so as Halo 1, Halo 2, and Halo 4 did before it. Speaking of previous Halo games, the only concern I had heading into Halo Infinite that I really had to worry about was the story. Halo 4 certainly has its issues, but its focus on Master Chief’s relationship with a Cortana who was rapidly succumbing to rampancy gave it a memorable and commendable emotional core. Halo 5, unfortunately, followed up by derailing any momentum that 4 had built by, among other narrative crimes, barely letting you play as Master Chief. It dug a deep hole for Halo Infinite to try and climb out of – particularly given that Infinite tries to both tie up 5’s loose ends and keep the existing storyline going, while also serving as the aforementioned “spiritual reboot” meant to welcome in new fans. In the end, it’s too tall a task. It’s so nice when a game actually lives up to sky-high expectations! Halo Infinite has been one of the most anticipated games out there since it was first announced three years ago, and for its multiplayer component to so fully deliver on the series’ classic feel while also keeping up with the modern-day competition in the FPS genre is a huge achievement. With some fantastic map design, a collection of straightforward but highly engaging modes for both large and small groups, excellent weapons and gear options, and those delightfully bouncy and sticky grenades, Halo Infinite’s multiplayer modes put it in the top tier of competitive shooters. Impressively, it manages to give nostalgic veterans the best of what they remember Halo multiplayer feeling like while also smoothly introducing new players to the joys of Spartan combat. It’s not a Halo 5-level disaster by any stretch – for starters, Infinite doesn’t waste time with any playable characters who aren’t Master Chief – but it probably isn’t going to really make most players happy. Its tale focuses on the splinter Covenant faction The Banished (last seen in Halo Wars 2) and was not particularly satisfying for this longtime Halo fan, and the new players Infinite is hoping to bring in might be outright lost. If you’re in the latter group, you’re going to ask the following questions (and plenty of others) that Infinite never answers: Who are the Covenant? Why is Cortana evil? What are the Guardians? None of that old ground is covered. And even if, like me, you’ve played every Halo campaign multiple times, the fact is that it’s been six years and the last one was the most convoluted Halo story ever means that it’s not easy to get comfortable with Infinite’s plot. This sixth Halo should’ve come with a “Halo’s Story So Far” cinematic that rolls before you start playing, as we’ve seen other long-running series do (most recently, Microsoft’s own Psychonauts 2). Maybe 343 ran out of time or maybe it never came up, but it’s a failure that could’ve been avoided. Still, there are really good aspects of the story too: namely, the relationship between Master Chief and his new AI companion, who we only know as The Weapon. She is voiced by Jen Taylor, who also stars as Cortana as well as Spartan program creator Dr. Catherine Halsey. You don’t need to be a hardcore Halo fan to recognize Taylor’s nuanced performances in playing three similar but distinct roles; she effortlessly separates the three, playing brilliantly off of the fact that The Weapon doesn’t know the Chief at all (though that makes it even stranger that basic Halo concepts aren’t spelled out for new players by using her as their proxy). We get to watch their partnership be born, then strain, and later strengthen. They get sarcastic with each other, they argue, and they build an unsteady alliance. Steve Downes, meanwhile, is fantastic in his sixth turn as Master Chief, who psychologically struggles through Infinite as an emotionally broken and lost man who blames himself for the sad state of humanity – the details of which are made painfully clear over the course of the campaign. I truly hope 343 never recasts either of these two wonderful voice actors. Getting back to gameplay, the FOBs are the real key to everything in Infinite’s open world. Recapture them and your map will populate with many of the aforementioned activities, along with other notable map icons like Spartan Core locations – the bounties of which allow you to upgrade your equipment in ways that let you tailor your playstyle. I pumped all of my points into the Shield Core at first, which made the bit of extra punishment that Heroic difficulty doles out feel plenty manageable. (If you’re going to tackle Legendary, I’d highly suggest this strategy.) The Grappleshot can be upgraded to add a paralyzing electric shock attack, boosting the Thruster will let you go invisible for a short time when you dash, and maxing out the Drop Wall gives you your own protective electric fence. I prioritized them in that order, ending with everything maxed out aside from two missing upgrades on the Drop Wall, and not only did the equipment add variety to how I handled abolishing the Banished, but many of the key boss fights cry out for one of them or another. (Thankfully, Infinite is never too heavy-handed about suggesting which one is best for each battle.) Completing the open-world activities also earns you Valor points, which do you the big favor of unlocking additional weapons and vehicles you can instantly summon from reclaimed FOBs. (Usefully, you’re also able to fast travel to any FOB you’ve unlocked.) This became vital – not to mention extremely fun – as I approached the 15 optional High-Value Targets (HVTs) scattered around the ring. For instance, one HVT – well, technically two – is a pair of heavy-hitting Hunters who are flanked by a legion of supporting Banished (along with some mid-battle surprises). I surveyed that scene, saw the challenge I was up against, then fast-traveled back to the closest FOB so that I could order up a shiny new Scorpion tank I’d unlocked access to, and then slowly rolled back to the HVT Hunters’ turf, trained my tank turret on them one at a time, and gleefully eliminated them. Even these heavier vehicles aren’t “I win” buttons, though, as bad guys on higher difficulties will quickly and repeatedly disable your vehicle with Shock Rifle blasts, often forcing you to try another strategy. This kind of freedom to fight how you want has always been a foundational component of Halo’s gameplay, but it arguably started diminishing after Halo 3 in favor of more structured battles with a slim choice of weapons. Infinite recaptures that signature freeform action in a big, fun way thanks to the diversity of locations and the ability to approach them from any angle and with any gear. Battles take place everywhere: in rivers, indoors,” in midair, and you’ll even have to fight uphill in scraps that feel like early 20th-century wars of attrition in the Halo universe (particularly on Heroic or Legendary difficulty). That encouraged me to use lots of the huge Halo arsenal rather than simply falling in love with one weapon (which would’ve been the trusty Battle Rifle, of course) for the entire campaign. Sometimes I’d want a charged-up Ravager plasma grenade launcher to stop charging Brutes in their tracks, other times a scoped weapon might be best for quickly headshotting Elites to drop their shields, and Grunts… well, they’re still hilariously pathetic (mostly), though Infinite offers more ways to blow them up than ever thanks to new attachments on their backs. Vehicles, meanwhile, are of particular importance in a Halo where you can wander all over the entire ring. The Mongoose is the first ride you’ll unlock, though without a co-op buddy, its only real purpose is zipping from point A to point B faster than you could run. But once you get into the meat of the campaign, you can call in a Warthog at a FOB, load it up with well-armed Marines, and stroll right up to a Banished stronghold and take out as many bad guys as you can from the perimeter before heading in. Or you can bring the Wasp in from above, clearing out significant numbers of Banished from the relative safety of the sky. Thanks to the large scale, vehicles have never felt more vital in Halo, which is probably the biggest compliment I can give because they’ve always been a high point of this series. Halo has meant a lot to me over the past 20 years. From first landing on the ring in Halo 1 to the surprise Arbiter arc in Halo 2 to being heartbroken by Halo 5’s abysmal storytelling, it’s one of the few series in gaming where every new mainline entry really matters to me. After six years, it was fair to wonder: did Halo still belong in the “Best Shooter” conversation? And would I still care about it? I am both relieved and delighted that Halo Infinite emphatically answers both questions with a resounding yes. Turning us loose to explore a massive open ring with almost complete freedom to approach combat with a wide range of iconic guns, vehicles, and toys has absolutely brought Halo’s single-player campaign back into contention as one of the finest out there (to say nothing of the amazing multiplayer suite), and even though it drops the ball a bit with the story and lack of environmental variety, Infinite picks it back up again with style. "
173,Chorus ,8.0,"I love a good space shooter, but my biggest pet peeve when playing them is endlessly circling an enemy as you try to line up a shot, chasing that target indicator at the edge of the screen until someone messes up. A few smart games have solved that issue one way or another, and Chorus’ is among the most direct: push a button and you’re instantly teleported behind your target, ready to blast them to bits. Described that way it sounds like a cakewalk, but Chorus definitely isn’t; when the pressure ramps up, even that trick and a few other god mode-like abilities might not save you. But one thing’s for sure: you’ll look pretty cool pulling them off, and the story that accompanies that action is respectable even though it threatens to drown you in lore.   When you boil it down, your character Nara is basically “what if Darth Vader defected after the destruction of Aldaraan?” She’s certainly well written and acted, coming off as genuine rather than whiny as she’s dragged into the resistance, but it does become a bit tiresome to hear a repentant war criminal wallow in guilt for the entirety of her roughly 30-hour fight to take down the space-cult leader who ordered her to commit atrocities. There is a clever touch to her delivery in that we get to listen in on her inner monologue during conversations, whispered in a voice we can hear but the people she’s talking to can’t. Getting to see Nara as a highly detailed and well animated character model during cutscenes certainly helped me get attached to her, though it’s hard not to notice that developer Deep Silver Fishlabs pretty clearly only had the budget for exactly one model of this quality. That becomes hilariously obvious when you count the number of times Nara encounters versions of herself, and absolutely no one else who isn’t either a misty phantom or wearing a mask. Where that’s an actual problem is that much of the story is told through other people’s residual memories that Nara can sense, though we only see the ships the characters are piloting and their portraits as their dialogue plays out, so it’s not always clear what’s going on. The same constraint of limited models is evident when all of the pirates you fight are flying the same handful of ship types as the cult you’re battling. So even though Chorus is a good-looking game, there were clearly a few corners cut to get there. On the other hand, Chorus’ map is open, with new star systems unlocking as you progress through the story, and each new area I unlocked impressed me with how much it differed from the last. While they’re all set in space, there is a surprising amount of diverse terrain to fly around, from enormous chunks of ice to space station cities, swirling stellar anomalies, and the weird geometric shapes of the evil aliens. Coupled with the respectable explosion and weapon effects and some slick lighting, it paints a pretty picture. A short time into the campaign Nara is paired up with a sentient space fighter known as Forsaken, who is very much like the non-sentient fighter she started with except that he has an extra slot for equipment mods and a personality I’d describe as “Venom meets R2-D2 doing a pretty good impression of James Spader’s Ultron voice.” I do wish there were more of a gameplay impact to supposedly having an intelligent sidekick flying with you at all times – outside of cutscenes he never really does anything – but I do enjoy his aggressive, openly resentful attitude and the intriguing backstory of his origins. It’s a missed opportunity that he’s almost never used for comic relief in the dour story.  The plot itself is easy enough to follow, since it’s largely about righteous revenge, vindication, and letting go of baggage, and there are some interesting revelations along the way. It’s a bit of a drag that the lore of Chorus’ universe feels so overstuffed with sci-fi religious philosophies and interdimensional threats that feed on negative emotions. It’s the kind of thing that might’ve worked better if I had been introduced to it gradually rather than being thrown more or less into the deep end and seeing it through the eyes of a character who doesn’t need to learn along with me. It redeems itself with the ending reveal, which adds something extra to the relationship between Nara and Forsaken. What makes Chorus’ space battles play out differently from and faster-paced than the typical space shooter are its powerful moves called rites. They seem like they should trivialize battles, but when the pressure is cranked up and you’re under attack from a swarm of enemies or a boss rites are essential to survival. The first rite you get (after the starting one that scans the area around you) lets you drift; the classic maneuver where you keep your momentum but freely rotate your fighter to bring your guns to bear on a pursuer or strafe the turrets off of a capital ship. (Let’s just ignore that this is a trick of zero-G physics, not a superpower, and yet no one else can do it for some reason.) Chorus puts this move to good use, not only in combat but also in puzzle sequences where you need to drift to quickly blast a series of targets. Later, you get that rite that instantly teleports you directly behind an enemy fighter so that all you have to do is pull the trigger to score a hit, eliminating much of the tiresome trait of the genre where you’re constantly chasing an indicator to line up a shot on your target. It feels ridiculously powerful, and it’s extremely handy for thinning the herd of pesky light fighters before going to work on larger targets.  Another rite simply disables any enemy for a short time, crippling previously impenetrable shields or, if properly timed, lets their momentum carry them straight into an asteroid or wall for a hilarious kill. (This is something that’s tracked and, if you do it enough, you get a stat bonus.) Used together, you can blink behind an enemy, disable them, and blast them to pieces. And there are a few more to discover, too. You’re given an almost insurmountable advantage, and yet there were a handful of encounters and boss fights that killed me more times than a seasoned space pilot like myself is enthusiastic about admitting when playing on normal difficulty. I can totally see someone becoming an artist with this system and dodging every incoming laser-sniper beam with well-timed rolls, switching to the correct weapon to chew through the defense of every enemy, avoiding obstacles, casting rites, and weaving through the chaos to efficiently take down targets. As of this writing I am not one of those people, but I have had some pretty spectacular and satisfying moments where it sure looked like I knew what I was doing. Some of the most impressive moments come when you’re battling capital ships that are bristling with turrets and can only be destroyed by taking out weak points like engines and glowy power generators, then flying inside their structures to torpedo their cores. It can be a little frustrating on the largest ships when you’re trying to track down the final destructible piece so that you can expose the core, but for the most part these battles are thrilling, especially when multiple ships are involved.  One area where Chorus doesn’t knock it out of the park is its weapons and mods: there aren’t a lot of options that will encourage you to change your build up, aside from leaning into your favorite among the Gatling gun, laser, and missile launcher weapon classes, or boosting your ability to cast rites faster. It certainly makes an impact, in that you can increase one weapon’s damage, decrease reload times, or increase your movement speed (among other things) by about 15%, and across the three mod slots you can stack up some significant bonuses. But while that’s definitely effective at ramping up your power, there’s nothing that radically changes the way a weapon works in the same way that a game like Hades lets you reinvent a weapon with lifesteal or chain damage or something crazy enough that it opens up new playstyles.  I’m sure you could power through the story a lot quicker than the roughly 30 hours it took me if you ignore the frequent side quests, but I wouldn’t recommend it because there are some good ones out there. Sure, there were a lot where I’d be zipping around a sector, hear a distress call, and stop to mop up some pirates only to be rewarded with a handful of credits, but surprisingly often those seemingly simple fights would turn into long quest chains with fleshed-out stories and characters and maybe the opportunity to temporarily pilot a capital ship, all leading to a powerful new weapon or upgrade. The prospect of running into more of those had me sidetracking to chase a lot more random events than I normally would in a game like this. Chorus does an excellent job of cutting out the dull parts of space dogfighting, getting right to the flashy fun of blasting through enemy fighters and capital ships with superpowered abilities. Its large and pretty map is filled with fleshed-out side quests, and they’re varied enough that it’s easy to cruise around for a few dozen hours and really get the hang of the combat system. The story behind it all isn’t half bad once you’ve waded through a flood of sci-fi mysticism, and Nara and Forsaken are interesting characters to spend all that time with – which is a relief, because they’re the only ones we ever get to see. "
174,Nerf Legends ,2.0,"There was a time in the early 2000s when you could reach into the bottom of a cereal box and occasionally pull out an entertainingly bad, low budget video game. Nerf Legends feels like it was supposed to be in one of those boxes, but was left out because it's not safe to package something this harmful to your health alongside someone’s breakfast. With atrocious gunplay, joyless puzzles, cringey writing, painful bugs, and legitimately broken multiplayer, this half baked disaster has absolutely nothing of interest to offer – even to those just looking for a nostalgic laugh. It’s a sloppy, tragic first-person shooter, and one of the worst games I’ve played in a long time. Arming you with an array of foam dart firing Nerf Blasters, the six-hour barebones story mode in Nerf Legends sends you on a strange and low stakes quest to defeat five different Nerf masters and secure your place among them. You don’t learn who any of the Nerf masters are and there isn’t some greater reason you’re trying to become a Nerf legend, with none of the childlike silliness a story like this could have so easily embraced. Instead you’re just told you need to do it and then a robot makes corny jokes at you along the way, as if playing through each level wasn’t bad enough on its own.  Each new area has you running through three or four repetitive obstacle courses where you fight swarms of cliche robotic enemies and solve braindead puzzles before you fight a samey boss and move on to the next gauntlet. Chief among the many gameplay atrocities you’ll endure is the godawful gunplay, which is an unsatisfying, frustrating, and buggy pile of mistakes. For one, shooting its Nerf guns just feels bad. Every weapon is inaccurate, wiggles around as you fire it, and needs to be reloaded painfully slowly every couple of seconds – so actually kinda close to using real Nerf guns. It also doesn’t feel good to fire them as your bullets are hard to see, barely make a noise as they leave your weapon, and have hardly any recognizable impact when they hit what you’re firing at unless you deal a killing blow, at which point the enemy explodes into pieces. When I played with Nerf guns as a kid, I’d always imagined larger-than-life explosions emanating from my weapons, doing exaggerated damage to anything I aimed at – the look and feel of a Nerf gun plays into that fantasy when you hold one in your hands. Instead, Nerf Legends finds a way to suck all the fun and fantasy out of Nerf by making them all feel weak, unwieldy, and incredibly mundane, and that’s a missed opportunity that only grew to disappoint me more and more the longer I played. What’s even worse is that, for whatever reason, attacking enemies with a melee hit is actually one of the most efficient ways to take them out. It actually one-hit kills most robots and is oftentimes easier than using the guns since you don’t have to deal with frustrating reload times. Because that’s what I remember most fondly from those childhood Nerf fights with my brothers: all the melee attacks. Brilliant! Believe it or not, that mess of unsatisfying gunplay is actually when it’s working as intended, because it regularly doesn’t. Guns will randomly lock up, not letting you fire bullets or reload until you swap weapons and swap back, which is incredibly frustrating. And sometimes you lose the ability to turn around or aim your weapons where you want with an odd glitch that drags your crosshair to one corner or another like a ghost has its thumb jammed up against your joystick. When this happened the only solution I found to fix it was killing myself and respawning. Unfortunately, that creates even more issues, because dying tends to break everything else. That’s right! Sometimes you’ll die and your character will just never respawn – instead you’ll find yourself stuck on an eternal kill cam until you quit to the main menu or reboot, which causes you to lose all progress for that level. Normally dying is a fairly regular, low stakes occurrence that results in an immediate respawn and practically no negative repercussions. But in the 10 or so times where dying lost me 20 minutes of progress due to this bug, I had to turn off my console and walk it off. The enemies you fight in each level are one of the more upsetting aspects of this Nerf misadventure too, as you fight the same handful of robot creatures over and over again and exactly none of them are interesting. Most enemies are little robot spiders or humanoids that pepper you with bullets while waddling around waiting to be killed. Occasionally you’ll find a big robo-scorpion or giant mecha that’s easier to kill if you aim for glowing weak spots, but the novelty of those fights wears off after their first appearance and you’ll see a whole lot of them as the levels go by. There are also lots of puzzles, though I’m using the term “puzzles” extremely loosely here. Most sections amount to standing in an area and fighting unlimited waves of enemies until a timer counts down or finding giant red buttons and shooting them with your gun to open a door. Hunting for buttons is actually an enormous part of what you spend your time doing in Nerf Legends, as almost every area has a big red forcefield that wants you to find three to five buttons in the immediate area before moving on. They’re completely pointless searches that add nothing except to delay your advance through the level, like the developers are charging you by the hour or something. I get that this is a Nerf game that’s probably designed for kids, but if stuff like Minecraft and Roblox are any indication, it’s hard to imagine any child who can hold a controller finding these puzzles even remotely compelling. Did I mention that Nerf Legends has some of the worst sound design I’ve ever heard? Because, good lord are you in for an auditory nightmare. The music consists almost exclusively of repetitive guitar solos while enemies beep and boop at you and the speaking characters haunt you with cringe-worthy performances. Whenever you have less than 50% of your health, which happens regularly, you hear a loud heartbeat that doesn’t go away until you heal. I get it, guys! I’m low on health! And worst of all: every single time you pick up a healing item, which happens constantly, you hear a loud beeping noise no fewer than four times. Four! It’s like getting punched in the ears four times every couple of seconds. It’s so irritating I actually preferred to just not pick up healing items or even let myself die sometimes because the beeping doesn’t happen when you respawn. It’s that annoying. Unfortunately, if you choose not to heal to avoid the beep, you get the heartbeat sound, so you can choose between your preferred version of hell. There are also boss fights, which serve as skill checks before you can advance to the next part of the campaign, but they do practically nothing to break up the persistent monotony. Each fight has you enter the ring with a humanoid that you’ve gotta beat three times before they kill you three times, and they are the only levels you can actually fail and have to start again. Unfortunately, with the exception of the final boss who does some barely interesting ninja moves like cloning copies of himself, these boss encounters do nothing to separate themselves from normal combat. The boss wanders around and shoots at you, you shoot back until they die, and it’s all over in a couple minutes. And, of course, all the issues with gunplay still apply to these battles, only with slightly higher stakes. Nerf Legends also has a multiplayer mode, or to be more precise, it doesn’t have one. That’s because the PvP it has literally doesn’t work. And when I say literally, I mean it genuinely is not functional. If you try to access the multiplayer mode, most of the time it tells you that you aren’t connected to the internet and locks you out entirely. When that doesn’t happen, it either tells you that no lobbies exist for you to join (presumably because no one else is playing) or asks you to make your own public lobby and wait for others to join. I tried to enter a multiplayer match for several hours a day for the better part of a week at different times of day and wasn’t able to play a single match. So far as I can tell from the reports of others online as well, there’s just no way to get multiplayer to work currently – but let’s be honest, we probably all dodged a foam dart there anyway. A complete lack of functional multiplayer, not respawning upon death, and guns not working correctly aren’t the only bugs you’ll find in this foam-covered catastrophe either. Not by a long shot! I got hard crashes to the Xbox dashboard, cutscenes that start in the middle for some reason, lip-syncing for characters that’s several seconds out of sync, enemies floating in the air when they aren’t supposed to, and much more. And don’t even get me started on the zipline system, which stalls you in the air for a second every time you attach yourself to one in the least smooth way possible. Doing so often causes a litany of its own issues, like not being able to move your character once you’ve detached or never being able to change your weapon for the rest of the level after using a zipline. I got so used to zip lines causing issues that seeing those yellow lines in the distance gave me anxiety at what fresh hell I was about to encounter. Nerf Legends is a painful first-person shooter that manages to suck all of the fun out of its over-the-top plastic weapons with abysmal gunplay, tedious puzzles, tons of bugs, and a multiplayer mode that literally doesn’t work at all. It’s disappointing to see a concept with so much potential to be an entertaining, lighthearted FPS squander it so entirely with a broken, harrowing cash grab, but even masochists looking for something to heckle should steer clear of this mess.

175,Solar Ash ,7.0,"I glide serenely through the undulating turquoise sea, enjoying the silky sensation of movement as I cut a path through this landscape of… what? Clouds?! The Ultravoid is an utterly surreal place - beautiful, colourful, yet also broken, desolate. This is all that’s left of a host of forgotten worlds, sucked inexorably into the gravitational pull of a massive black hole. Above me, a monstrous-looking creature known as a Remnant patrols the sky, and it’s so large I’ll literally skate along its back when I confront and kill it; part of a desperate bid to save my home planet from becoming the latest victim of The Ultravoid’s insatiable appetite. Solar Ash has some big ideas, and while it’s not all smooth skating thanks to minor control quirks and a couple of design elements that don’t quite reach their full potential, it’s definitely a journey worth taking. Solar Ash’s vivid colour palette is evocative of developer Heart Machine’s last game, Hyper Light Drifter, but transposed to a 3D open-world, in which momentum is the overriding design principle. In Solar Ash you’re faced with platforming challenges, light puzzles, enemy encounters, bosses, and impossible spaces - and you glide your way through it all, accompanied by an appropriately atmospheric, synth-driven sci-fi score.  You are Rei, a Voidrunner who has ventured inside a black hole called The Ultravoid, and you’re trying to find out what happened to each of your companions and ensure the conduits they set up throughout the different sectors of the void are operational. These are necessary to power a gigantic, monolithic piece of technology called the Starseed - which, in turn, is the only hope to close the black hole itself and save Rei’s planet from imminent destruction. This broad story set-up translates to reaching and clearing out anomalies that are interfering with the conduits, then defeating each area’s colossal boss creature. Action-platforming is very much the main driver of Solar Ash, but it’s interested in worldbuilding too, and has plenty to dig into via story elements like audio logs left by Rei’s missing teammates, scrawled notes in the environment, a handful of survivors you can talk to, and quizzing Rei’s friendly AI construct Cyd on the details of the mission. This all helps make the overarching plot more impactful as it gradually comes into clarity, leading to a climax that’s punchier than I was expecting; a neat twist for a game that’s so kinetic in focus most of the time. This kineticism is expressed through wide open environments and platforming challenges that allow Rei to almost always be in motion. You’re able to scan each area for key objectives, while telltale icons on surfaces reveal if a hidden audio log is nearby. The fun here is in working out how to reach objectives, not wondering where they are, so I always felt like I was navigating the world with purpose. Rei has a slight yet powerful set of abilities, crafted specifically for open-world platforming. She smoothly transitions between running and skating, with an incredible feeling - and sounding - boost ideal for zooming past enemies, hitting a lip at top speed, or just catapulting forward from a standing start. I appreciated having to wrangle Rei’s inertia in order to bring her to a sudden stop from full pelt, but the joy of movement was occasionally stymied by quirks like inexplicably going the wrong way on a rail, missing grinds entirely, or falling off a platform thanks to an unhelpful camera. But for the most part the skating feels great between those hiccups, whether you’re boosting then double jumping to skip across the surface of treacherous acid lakes, leapfrogging through a series of grapple points in the air, directing then riding mushroom rails, or ascending a bulbous column of clouds in order to reach an ancient structure high in the sky. This is a world full of swooping rails, of floating platforms, of localised gravity, and of simple but satisfying movement puzzles. While there are enemies to fight, encounters with them are streamlined. Rei can time slip to slow down time then grapple in, instantly dispatching smaller foes with a slash or two. When this works it adds nicely to Solar Ash’s flow, and Rei can pull off some pretty sweet moves like grappling to an enemy in the air, and killing it before leaping to a climbable surface. When it doesn’t, however, Rei can feel a little clumsy. She’s very good at closing the gap, for instance, but not so great at handling multiple enemies, and it can be difficult to avoid taking damage in some situations. These enemies really are a sideshow, however - obstacles to avoid or defeat en route to the main objectives: the anomalies. These are areas of volatile black goo (as opposed to the  inert, climbable black goo throughout levels) and each is treated like a movement puzzle. Slashing at the exposed nerve ending (represented by a protruding spike) reveals an energy trail through the gunk and bone to another point, and potentially several more, each of which must be slashed before the anomaly overheats and fries anything on it. In a stylish touch, Rei is always able to grapple to the final point to stab its energy core and clear the anomaly. Each of these mini-challenges is unique but the quickly familiar structure of them means only some actually stand out. The best anomalies deliver on Solar Ash’s movement-focused foundation to make Rei feel like a bad-ass, but just as in combat, others can leave her feeling a bit like she has two left feet. Defeating the huge titans that Rei grapples aboard also follows a similar structure of moving from node to node, but are entirely built around skating and grappling, which helps make them feel faster-paced and more streamlined than some of the anomalies. Each Remnant is beaten in stages - usually the same run of hitting nerve endings three times over, but with added steps or less safe areas to skate on each time. These encounters are a frantic dash against the clock, and the sight of riding along the back of a flying, otherworldly creature or dashing up the arm of a lumbering behemoth before grappling across to another part of its body is certainly impressive. That said, they also expose some of the weaker elements of Solar Ash’s gameplay - chiefly, it can be difficult to judge your position and momentum while atop a moving creature, particularly as the camera shifts around. Generally it’s not such a problem for the first two stages of each Remnant challenge, but I found the third and final sequence - where there’s less room for error - a little frustrating for several of the beasts, particularly as a single slip-up can mean a third stage restart. Heart Machine has definitely leaned into the ability to slow time and grapple during these encounters, which helps make the controls feel more precise without losing the energy and the spectacle, but overall I was typically more relieved than elated when I beat these bosses. In general, in fact, it’s actually the journey - as opposed to the destination - that I got the most out of from Solar Ash’s gameplay, and that’s probably because this is when you’re most in the world, enjoying its striking aesthetic and the differences between biomes. The Mirrorsea area, for instance, mixes up vertiginous rails and floating space debris with acid pools and ancient ruins. Eternal Garden, on the other hand, is completely different to explore, cleverly using the native fungi for movement puzzles and shifting the mood as Rei ventures into pitch dark caverns. It’s absolutely worth chasing the collectables in Solar Ash as well, as finding all the Voidrunner stashes in an area unlocks a new suit for Rei to wear that typically offers a genuinely useful new buff. These include doubling your attack power, drastically reducing your boost cooldown, the ability to scan for remaining stashes, and more. It would have been nice if these weren’t either/or choices, however - I’d have loved to be able to equip at least a couple of these bonuses at once. There’s also the fact that by the time I’d actually collected all the suits, well, I had very little left to do in the world. Solar Ash took me a little over seven hours to beat on normal difficulty, and while some of the anomalies and bosses were less entertaining than others, and there were moments of frustration with the controls, this was a world I enjoyed spending time in. This game may take place in a ruinous void, but its clean yet vibrant visual design is full of life, as is the story that ultimately gives Rei’s journey meaning. "
176,uined King: A League of Legends Story ,8.0,"Airship Syndicate’s work on Ruined King: A League of Legends Story weaves a wonderful tale that is primed to capture League of legends fans new and old. Blending the design ideas of its previous turn-based RPG, Battle Chasers: Nightwar, with LoL’s lore, it brings together a handful of favorite characters and gives them room to grow over the course of a lengthy and well-paced campaign. While some bugs slowed me down, a compelling story, gorgeous graphic novel-style art, modest character development, and versatile combat kept me entertained as I finally got to experience the world of Runeterra from a different perspective. Riot has spent the last decade creating diverse, unique, and memorable characters for its MOBA, but until recently they’ve been showcased mainly through video shorts. All that changed in November 2021, first with Netflix’s brilliant animated series Arcane, and now Ruined King and its vast amount of dialogue and backstory, fans like myself can dive far deeper into what makes at least a small portion of the 157-character roster so special. Coming away from this adventure, I found myself more invested in characters I previously knew but had sidelined.  Ruined King’s plot centers around the impending awakening of King Viego at the hands – and hook – of Thresh, who plots to take over the world of Runeterra with the next Harrowing (a corrupting force that wreaks havoc on the world, claiming the souls of all who perish within for eternity) and harvest more souls to torment. The heroes and villains play the roles they need to move the average “stop the villain from destroying the world” story along, and while I found it predictable, the execution is still enjoyable thanks to the strong voice work of industry staples like Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey, Liam O’Brien, and others who reprise their respective roles from League of Legends. It added yet another level of authenticity and charm that pulled me in from the very beginning. Ahri, Braum, Illaoi, Miss Fortune, Pyke, and Yasuo are each on journeys that resourcefully intertwine and unfold, depicted in a gorgeous graphic novel art style across my roughly 30-hour main campaign playthrough (and an extra five to 10 hours to finish side quests like bounties or fishing to obtain components to craft legendary weapons). Characters in my party were challenged by their own relatable yet all-too-familiar trials of vengeance, acceptance, and self-discovery that foster growth within them. It was neat to see more of them, but I would have loved to see them dive deeper into certain people; Yasuo’s arc is concluded with a singular battle that heals his trauma and sets him on a more purposeful path and it’s hardly mentioned afterward, making it feel a bit rushed. The main story keeps everyone focused on the main objective and did a great job of keeping me invested. Most of my favorite moments came from conversations over a meal in cutscenes that accompany the scarcely placed rest points and give breathing room between a dungeon of enemies and the boss at the end. However, it was sometimes too much of a good thing; I wished there had been more rest points to split up the conversations instead of packing as many as four into one, plus I wouldn’t have minded more frequent auto-saves. While the main story is enjoyable without any prior knowledge of the LoL universe, many of the side conversations involve characters telling stories grounded in their world by previously established lore. Anyone who has read Yasuo’s biography or watched the Kin of the Stained Blade will know his past and what haunts him and causes his hesitation in forging bonds with others, but it was the emotional evolution of him engaging with other characters, like the ever-jovial Braum, that became the driving force in captivating me in nearly every conversation. The prologue starts things off with an enjoyable series of fast-paced in-battle tutorials as the Swashbuckling Miss Fortune fights off a mysterious black mist that harkens back to the previous Harrowings while teaching you just a fraction of the strategic turn-based combat mechanics. What makes Ruined King’s battle system interesting and versatile is how its Speed, Balanced, and Power attack types play out on the initiative bar timeline, and the counters to each. Casting Miss Fortunes’ “Guns Blazing” ability in the Power lane slows her down as she prepares to launch a heavy attack but pushes her allies forward in the turn order, giving them another chance to attack or defend before the enemies get to move while increasing her own evasion stat. Meanwhile, Speed casting Ahri’s Spirit Mend will heal and cleanse two debuffs from an ally or revive them if they are already KO’d. Another layer is added with wildcards, boons, and hazards, that help or hinder via healing, poison, or temporary stat boosts. These mechanics continue to evolve with new ideas introduced at an unhurried pace until roughly the midway point of the main story, which is around the time you complete your party. From that point on it’s more about demonstrating your level of mastery of the systems, such as finishing an enemy off in 10 hits or less to prevent them from self-destructing and dealing massive damage or using a Power-based attack to knock an enemy out of their defensive stance, creating a window to defeat them before they regain their footing. I would’ve preferred to get to that point a little sooner, though, because in the early hours I felt ready to move on to the next concept before Ruined King was ready to teach it to me. My other issue with combat is the default battle speed: sure, it gives you more time to enjoy cute animations like Braum’s Poro Snack and vicious ones like Pyke's ultimate, Reaper – but their novelty wore off quickly. After watching each character's arsenal of 12 unique moves (many of which originate from League of Legends) half a dozen times, I was extremely grateful for the ability to double the battle speed for the rest of the campaign and immediately found myself enjoying combat more. Living ForgeRafael Motamayor November 20, Ruined King isn’t going to ruin a lot of experienced RPG players with its difficulty, though. My playthrough on Heroic (the hardest difficulty) only slowed me down marginally compared to my time spent on the lower difficulty options, since upgrading and enchanting abilities and characters are efficient and effortless ways to gain the upper hand. Most notably, late-game enemies like the Guardian Prototype’s HP scaled from 16K on Story mode up to 36K on Heroic. Despite having more HP to deplete, itemizing and upgrading Illaoi to simultaneously tank and heal, Ahri to heal while dealing damage, and Pyke to add absurd amounts of debuffs with his damage ended most battles by the enemies second or third turn. In the rarest occasions where I did lose a battle, it was at the hands of a new enemy specifically made to test my mastery of a new concept that had been recently introduced, such as Wisp Mothers who could one-shot any party member with their Nightmare ability if you don’t take them down quickly, or bosses with ultimate abilities that could blast away 80% of my HP if specific debuffs weren’t removed in time. However, if you’re new to RPGs and just want to enjoy the story without beating your head against a tougher fight, Story Mode allows you to skip any battle, including bosses, while still reaping the benefits in crafting materials and XP. Ruined King hits its stride in the latter half, especially as party dynamics are challenged regularly to teach the value of synergy when fighting certain enemies. During a trip to The Shadow Isles, I encountered the extremely deadly Mistwalker Executioners that would use their Guillotine attack to one-shot lower HP allies if I failed to use a tank character like Braum to taunt and absorb the hit with his shields. Meanwhile, corrupted assassins like “Pain Harvesters” used Harvest Pain to remove all debuffs on its allies and grant itself a 10% damage buff per stack; this encouraged me to either kill him first or avoid using attacks that cause debuffs if I had other options, like Wisp Mothers. While about 90% of games in League of Legends take place in a single location, I hoped Ruined King would take us on a more expansive tour of the world. Based on trailers and the opening sequence, I knew I would visit the Shadow Isles – home to Thresh, Hecarim, Viego, and others – and that got my hopes up for the chance of seeing places like Ionia, Piltover, or Noxus. But even after spending the first half dozen hours in Bilgewater and gaining access to my ship, that dream never came to fruition. The majority of the story splits its time between Bilgewater and The Shadow Isles, and while there are dungeons like the Purification Temple and Windrake Isle that break up the visual monotony, even they are limited in diversity. Windrake Isle starts out full of vibrant emerald greens, oranges, and reds while on the surface but upon entering the three-room dungeon it immediately reverts back to the muted blue and green color palette seen in the Purification Temple and Bhuru Temple. Most locations do have plenty to explore, at least, and are inhabited with standard NPCs, enemies, optional quests, fishing spots, bounties to hunt, and puzzles to solve. Though exploration is hobbled by a map system that leaves a lot to be desired – such as typical functions like zoom or the ability to mark locations to come back to later. It wasn’t all Poros and sunshine in Runeterra: Ruined King suffers from some game-crashing bugs that I encountered routinely playing on PS5 (sometimes at important story moments), and other issues that can slow down progress, like when character models become invisible and unable to interact with objects, and two separate instances where I came back to a corrupted save file or a load screen freezing at 95%. The good news is that things like this happened noticeably less frequently as I played, which may have been thanks to quick patches and hotfixes. The more time I spent playing Ruined King: A League of Legends Story the more I found myself wanting from the LoL universe. The gorgeous graphic novel art, accompanied by fantastic character development and voice work, and a solid story kept me engaged from start to finish. The intricate yet easy-to-digest turn-based battle and upgrade systems generally reward experimentation and exploration while allowing more methodical strategies to shine. The untimely and frequent game-crashing bugs, mediocre map screen and limited variety of locations, and sparse autosave system are all minor headaches, but considering that we’ve been waiting years for the League of Legends universe to branch out to other genres, the turn-based RPG format of Ruined King is an absolute fit. "
177,Halo Infinite Multiplayer ,9.0,"First impressions are key, and since six years have passed since Halo 5: Guardians, for a lot of people (like myself) Halo Infinite will be the first Halo multiplayer experience they’ve played at launch – especially since Infinite’s multiplayer is free to play and accessible to everyone with an Xbox or PC. And what a launch it’s been! With its tight 4v4 matches and more chaotic 12v12 Big Team Battle on expertly designed maps, Infinite revives and reinvigorates the glorious sci-fi action that once made Halo king among multiplayer FPS games. Riding high on that thrill, Halo Infinite’s multiplayer has dash-slid into the first-person shooter scene and meleed the competition off the map. While Halo Infinite's multiplayer is technically still in beta until the single-player campaign comes out on December 8, developer 343 Industries has declared that we’re officially in Season 1, and Infinite comes complete with purchasable cosmetics and a battlepass. In other words, it is for all intents and purposes fully launched.  Halo Infinite looks absolutely gorgeous. The environments within each map are so detailed and pretty that I’m now looking forward to the campaign even more. The lighting, settings, and overall look of Infinite bring the futuristic world of Halo to modern-day glory. On PC, it can run at 144Hz easily (and there’s a 120Hz mode on Xbox Series X), and the most severe technical issue I’ve seen has been some server desync and stutters every so often. It wasn’t enough to really mess things up but it was noticeable and made some fights slightly harder than they should have been. I’ve only experienced one crash in my 20 hours of playtime, so my experience has been pretty steady.  Ahead of the beta “test flights” in September, one of my biggest concerns was how Halo Infinite would be able to court new players in addition to pleasing Halo veterans who have a lot of set-in-stone ideas of how Halo should play. But to my surprise, Infinite does a stand-up job of bringing novices up to speed with its Academy mode, in which you can try out different weapon drills or jump into a Training session against bots with customizable match settings. Training mode allows you to try out different power items (such as active camouflage and the grappling hook) that you may not have been able to get hold of much in PvP matches, and it also helps you learn the maps as you explore at your own pace. You can also join matches against bots if you want to test your skills before facing other players – and these are some of the most human-like bots I’ve ever seen. When I did go up against real opponents, the intimate 4v4 Arena playlist’s fast-paced matches gripped me immediately and had me queuing again and again, for hours on end. The only complaint I have about the playlists is not being able to choose which mode you want to play – you can’t just check a box to pick Slayer or Strongholds, you have to queue for all five game modes: One Flag Capture The Flag, Capture The Flag, Strongholds, Oddball, and Slayer. While they aren’t revolutionary, they are undoubtedly fun and infinitely replayable, and have formed the basis of some of the most enjoyable multiplayer arena shooters of all time. As they say: if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.  Slayer is the traditional team deathmatch, Strongholds has teams fighting to control three capture points on the map, and in Oddball you’re battling over control of a skull. But among the 4v4 modes, my favorite remains plain-old Capture the Flag, which stays fun and competitive no matter how many times I’ve played it. Coordinating with my team and making mad dashes for the enemy’s flag while also chasing down the jerk who stole ours fuels my spirit, and scoring a capture is incredibly rewarding. Playing either defensively around my flag or offensively in trying to steal the enemy’s feels good, and due to the small team sizes no one is unimportant in a match. The only unconventional mode in that list, One Flag CTF, sounded a little odd to me at first because each round has one team defending a flag and the other team has to capture that flag. But it’s actually a lot of fun – there’s only one map for it, Launch Site, but it has vehicle spawns and easily makes for chaotic and fun gameplay with vehicular Spartan-slaughter as one team attempts to raid the other’s base. All of these game modes are excellent – and much more so when you’re communicating with your teammates. I do have a few gripes, of course. For one, barely being able to hear a seven-foot-tall, heavily armored Spartan run up behind you for a one-hit melee kill is incredibly frustrating. It’s an odd misstep (see what I did there?) given that the weapons and effects all sound great. I don’t want heavy footstep sounds like in CS:GO, where you can tell where people are from pretty much all the way across the map, but the number of times I’ve been run up on – not even crouch stealthed – and killed is kind of ridiculous. Also, cloaked enemies being silent makes sense since the Active Camo powerup requires you to walk or crouch to stay invisible.  A big part of the reason Infinite’s matches work so well is that each of the seven maps for arena matches are incredibly well designed to allow for you and your team to fluidly rotate through them, grabbing key weapons and items as they spawn and sweeping out enemies. My favorite map from that playlist has to be Streets, thanks to its flashy neon signs, dynamic lighting, and freshly rained-upon pavement. It’s a perfect example of readability being key when it comes to map design, favoring bold, angular architecture instead of over-detailed environments that come at the cost of instantly spotting enemies and objective markers. It's Strongholds mode that really shows off Infinite’s superior map designs, however, since in this capture-point mode you really need to be able to rotate from point to point with a specific flow to keep an eye on the locations you already control. While the maps in Infinite are smaller than those in most FPS games, the distance between points is just enough that you can easily get from one spot to another. At the same time, you can also get caught out by yourself and eliminated, which encourages you to move as a team. This is where the flow of maps really comes into play. In general, you can run from one side of a map to the other quickly enough that they don’t feel all that large for 4v4 matches, but they’re big enough that you don’t get there too fast or feel like they’re too cramped of a space, either. There are lots of platforms and objects stacked on top of each other that you can use to perfect your rotations, so you aren’t restricted to going down one hallway just to get to a specific area – we actually have a lot of options in these spaces thanks to the ability to vault up to ledges and the absence of fall damage. I’m impressed with how the map designs take all of this into consideration, especially on this smaller scale.  Even with Big Team Battle, the three maps are evenly balanced for 12v12 matches. BTB showcases expansive arenas with enough space for close-range mayhem, long-range sniper plays, rumbling Scorpion tanks, and flying Banshee fighters. I like how, unlike Call of Duty’s breakneck-paced 12v12 matches, BTB allows for you to catch a few moments of breathing time before you engage in a heated fight. The weapon spawns are spaced out enough to give everyone a chance to run for them and the vehicle spawns are mirrored on each team’s side, making for awesome vehicle runs. Power weapons and items are always a risk to play for since they’re placed in the middle of maps, and that makes balancing feel just right. All three BTB maps feature multiple terrain types that give their layouts variety in height and sightlines. In Behemoth, there are a lot of platforms that let you get higher positioning at the risk of getting sniped from across the way, since the higher levels are more exposed. However, if you’re lower on the ground you may not spot the enemies above your head. The flow in BTB maps feels great – it never takes too long to get into a fight but there’s also enough space that I’ve had no trouble with spawn camping at all. After yet another year of Call of Duty’s notoriously bad spawn system, that’s been a breath of fresh air. You can play all of that casually, but Infinite also includes a Ranked playlist, available off the drop, which is a great competitive mode for those who want to surround themselves with equally skilled players. You knock out 10 placement matches before you’re given your initial rank, then you can grind out some matches in that Ranked playlist to move up. The tiers are reasonable (going from Bronze to Onyx with six levels within each tier) but the one thing I’d want more clarification on is how you’re graded on performance to move up or down tiers. Right now that’s a bit mysterious.  In terms of gunplay, the weapons feel decently balanced, with some distinctive quirks to them. The Time to Kill (TTK) is certainly longer than in most other games and took me a bit of time to adjust to, maybe a few matches at most, before I was no longer surprised that a target was still standing after I’d unloaded most of an assault rifle’s magazine into them. It probably takes a couple of shots more than I’d like to down an enemy, and that does make it a little harder to win 1v2s here than in faster games like Apex Legends or Call of Duty. But Halo is very much a game about team play, so if you’re smart you won’t be trying to take on multiple adversaries too often since that usually means you’re overextending by yourself. I have to say, it’s very weird that the MK50 Sidekick pistol is stronger than the MA40 Assault Rifle. While I understand that Halo games have had this balance as the meta going all the way back to the original and the AR is the strongest it’s been in any game in the series, it just seems weird to have a pistol outgun a big, chunky AR. Meanwhile, a few of the weapons you pick up out of dispensers on the walls feel a bit weak in their damage per second (DPS), especially with guns like the VK Commando which sounds and looks like a beefy gun that should knock a target flat but actually takes quite a few extra shots to kill an enemy, even with headshots. That said, the weapon variety is pretty generous, allowing you to pick your choice of pistols, burst rifles, and shotguns. The Mangler, a precision-based revolver, is one of my favorite pistols to use since it rewards you for careful shots and can be used at close or long range (once you learn to compensate for the projectile drop). The CQS48 Bulldog is my favorite shotgun (much better than the fancier-sounding Heatwave) because of its tight spread that can take down a target quickly with accurate body shots. Also, the fan-favorite Needler feels especially rewarding when you’re able to stick a full stack of heat-seeking needles into an enemy and watch them explode after a short delay. Overall, the weapons feel satisfying to use and nothing is wildly overpowered – not including Power Weapons, of course. However, there are a few weapons that I find myself avoiding, like the Plasma Pistol and the Pulse Carbine – I just don’t like the rate of fire of either of them and they don’t output the amount of DPS needed in a close-range fight.   The Power Weapons, such as the M41 SPNKR rocket launcher and the Gravity Hammer, are limited to a few shots to keep things from getting out of control when you snag one. However, the Energy Sword definitely seems to have three to four charges too many – that could be toned down a bit, since right now the only thing keeping it in check is the fact that you have to close in to melee range to score a kill with it. While the weapons feel as great and handle as we’ve come to expect from Halo, one thing that feels disappointingly inconsistent is the melee. Standard Spartan melees are a two-hit kill, which feels fine, but the range and damage rarely seems to work the way I expect. It doesn’t help that Infinite uses soft collision, meaning you can pass through another player, instead of hard collision, where you bounce off of each other. While soft collision keeps people from griefing each other by blocking doorways, a side effect is that the way people can phase through each other means melee strikes don’t feel right. Sometimes you’re able to get a “backsmack” instant kill while facing your opponent and other times you completely miss by phasing through their body and they get the opportunity to kill you. Also, I’ve seen what appear to be direct melee hits to the face do no damage, even when the enemy is a sneeze’s worth of health away from dying. Something you can always count on, though, is the classic Halo grenade plays. Calculating the timing on a grenade throw and counting the bounces before it goes off and kills an enemy is one of the most rewarding experiences in Infinite’s multiplayer. Being able to throw a ‘nade behind enemy cover and then push them backwards into the explosion is so satisfying, and sticking someone with a plasma grenade is always a hilarious way to earn a kill. In this game, grenades are an art form.  Infinite also makes smart use of its gadgetry. The Grappleshot is my favorite, and I use it to reposition myself around enemies in active fights. It’s also great for a quick disengage from close-range fights to heal up before grappling back in to finish the fight. I also really enjoy the fact that you can grapple enemies and catch them off guard, and even throw in an elbow punch to the back of their heads when you get right up to them. I’ve even come to love the Thruster – it took a while to grow on me, but now I’ve found ways to get creative and dash past enemies, then turn and backslap them during heated fights where they were trying to keep their distance. The Drop Wall still isn’t my favorite equipment item, but that’s purely based off of my aggressive playstyle – hunkering down behind a deployable shield just makes me feel like grenade bait. Active Camo is much more my style, since its invisibility allows me to get multiple stealth kills in a row literally before they know what hit them. I also love the Repulsor, which reflects projectiles back at enemies while also pushing them back from you. Using it to throw enemies off the map was probably not what it was intended for, but it’s a ton of fun to mess around with equipment and weapon combos like that. Having that creative freedom is important, and Infinite does a great job of allowing you to have fun while slaying. And all of that comes at just the right time. In fact, Microsoft couldn’t have chosen a better moment for Master Chief’s comeback, with Call of Duty: Vanguard's multiplayer feeling like more of the same and Battlefield 2042’s main modes leaving much to be desired. Infinite’s long-absent style of team-based multiplayer is the shot in the arm the shooter community needed right now.  Halo Infinite’s store is open for business and the bundles and options for its purely cosmetic wares are varied. The pricing feels fair and evenly set relative to other free-to-play games, with daily Rare bundles costing $5 (500 credits) and weekly Legendary bundles going for $20 (2,000 credits). The Season 1 Battlepass costs 1,000 credits, so about $10, and the Premium Pass Bundle costs 2,800 credits, around $28. Since Infinite’s multiplayer is free to play it makes sense that it’d have a battlepass, but what’s awkward is that the rewards within it are pretty lackluster. Outside of a couple of neat fire effects that can be applied to your character, all you get are things like plain armor coatings and uninspired helmet attachments. Nothing in it has interested me more than what you can earn without paying.  Also, the challenge system doesn't provide much XP, so the free cosmetic options take a long time to unlock. With the inability to choose the game modes you want to play, completing some of these challenges are difficult because you might just get half an hour of Slayer on two rotating maps and be unable to complete a challenge that requires a specific vehicle that spawns on a different map. Daily and weekly challenges should be engaging and make you feel a sense of accomplishment after completing one, but these are just small drops in a very large bucket. It’s too much of a grind to feel worth spending money on the battlepass for some meager customization unlocks as the progression rewards. Even after an update that doles out a flat 50 XP after every match and tweaks to the challenge deck it still feels like a slog, and I don’t feel rewarded for a good performance.  However, I do love that 343 Industries is showing esports teams some love with armored skin sets themed after partnered Halo Championship Series esports organizations, such as Cloud9 and Faze, so you can show support for your favorite teams.   Halo has meant a lot to me over the past 20 years. From first landing on the ring in Halo 1 to the surprise Arbiter arc in Halo 2 to being heartbroken by Halo 5’s abysmal storytelling, it’s one of the few series in gaming where every new mainline entry really matters to me. After six years, it was fair to wonder: did Halo still belong in the “Best Shooter” conversation? And would I still care about it? I am both relieved and delighted that Halo Infinite emphatically answers both questions with a resounding yes. Turning us loose to explore a massive open ring with almost complete freedom to approach combat with a wide range of iconic guns, vehicles, and toys has absolutely brought Halo’s single-player campaign back into contention as one of the finest out there (to say nothing of the amazing multiplayer suite), and even though it drops the ball a bit with the story and lack of environmental variety, Infinite picks it back up again with style.

178,Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl ,8.0,"Developer Game Freak has been doggedly committed to churning out a Pokémon game nearly every year for more than a decade now, but it has seemingly conceded it can’t do it all anymore. For the latest Pokémon remakes, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, it put one of the world’s best-known game series into the hands of a support studio many had never even heard of: ILCA. So what does a Pokémon remake look like without Game Freak in the driver’s seat? Turns out it looks a lot like the Pokémon game that Game Freak made, tip to Tail Whip, without the adventurous differences that defined prior remakes. Past Game Freak remakes such as Pokémon Let’s Go, HeartGold and SoulSilver, and Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire have tried, for better or worse, to be ambitious and bold with their reinventions as they revitalized what is now ancient Pokémon history for a new generation. Perhaps because this set of remakes is in different hands with more at stake, Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are neither ambitious nor bold. Like the themes of their story, they are solid and enduring – leaning on the past, with all of its triumphs and tripwires.  In its marketing materials, we were promised a “faithful remake” of 2006’s Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, and by Arceus, that’s what we got. It’s admittedly hard to look at Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl and not imagine that Game Freak and The Pokémon Company weren’t leaning forward in the back seat, frantically yelling directions. Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are, in almost every respect, meticulously faithful. Fortunately, Diamond and Pearl were pretty darn good games to begin with. Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl tell the same story of a kid going on an adventure to catalog monsters before accidentally becoming the strongest fighter in the region and taking down an overt death cult with weird hair – you know, standard Pokémon stuff. There are no earth-shattering surprises, even after you beat the Elite Four and unlock the National Dex, and for the time being the Pokémon roster is limited to just the Pokémon that were available in Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum back in the day, so don’t expect newer favorites like Corviknight, Wooloo, or Toxtricity. After ten years of Game Boy Pokémon catching and battling, the core game mechanic still holds up as an addictive game design -- tons of strategic depth and gameplay that's incredibly rewarding; it's one of those games that offers an enormous sense of accomplishment for even the littlest things performed. And the touch screen functions of the Nintendo DS help move things faster and easier with simple navigation menus. The developers more capitalize on the system's capabilities in function and interface rather than visual and audio presentation. Sure, there are elements going on here that couldn't be done on the Game Boy Advance, but it's hard to argue that the game looks and sounds a heck of a lot like the past portable versions. 8-bit limitations drove the game's original style, but now that the limits are no longer there it's a little bit of a letdown that Game Freaks played the whole Pokémon production conservatively instead of pushing something more epic. The gameplay holds up incredibly well a decade later, but we're still looking like a 10-year-old portable game here. That may sound rather disappointing on paper, but in practice it’s just dang nice to revisit  a simpler time in the Pokémon world without the 900-something Pokémon to keep track of or a bunch of weird, special mechanics – especially because it turns out that what the original Diamond and Pearl lack in modern complexity, they more than make up for in depth. The fourth generation of Pokémon is stuffed with things to do, and so too then is Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. Its story takes its time in a way the series has largely forgotten, sending you through personable little hamlets with smaller attractions and no gyms, as well as long, winding routes full of trainer battles that will have your Pokémon gulping potion after potion before you reach the next story destination. As an old geezer in Pokémon terms, I’ve missed these gauntlets ever since the series phased them out in favor of shorter stretches, fewer distractions, and more healing breaks. Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl seem meatier for it, too, landing at around 40 hours if you’re at least dabbling in everything you come across, and longer if you dig in. These lengthy hikes are made longer and more complex by the ways in which their design incorporates puzzle-solving moves (HMs) like Rock Climb, Surf, Defog, and so forth. Did Diamond and Pearl, and by extension Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, have too many HMs? Oh heavens yes – but the remake cleverly relegates these moves to the smartphone-like Pokétch menu, rather than making you carry a Bidoof in your party at all times to cut down trees for you. That allows the many hidden areas of Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl to be transformed from unrewarding chores to exciting little spelunks for treasure as you hike your way under, over, around, and through the Sinnoh region’s centerpiece, Mt. Coronet.  The post-game is even more packed with things to find. Just like the originals, Brilliant Diamond and Shining pearl have tons of legendaries to track down, rematches with some of your toughest adversaries, sidequests, a whole extra island area after you finish the National Pokédex that’s full of challenging battles, and a wealth of additional Pokémon to catch that don’t appear until you’ve at least seen the first 150. Again, this was all present in the original, but it comes off as even more impressive in 2021 when we’re accustomed to Pokémon games that either make you pay for DLC or write off the post-game entirely. ILCA’s faithfulness to the original Diamond and Pearl extends to the original pair’s weaknesses, too, and nowhere does the commitment surface more conflicting emotions than in the roster of Pokémon you can build your team from. Diamond and Pearl have an utterly bizarre slate of Pokémon partners, skewed heavily toward a handful of types (where are the fire Pokémon?) that make it challenging to assemble anything resembling a balanced group without being railroaded into using a few specific staples (shoutout to Ponyta). That’s still mostly the case in the Brilliant and Shining versions. ILCA devoutly stuck to the original roster monsters for the main story, with the rest unlocked in post-game – and, frankly, some of the original Diamond and Pearl Pokémon line-up kind of stinks! While Platinum’s expanded roster is available for capture if you make enough visits to the Grand Underground and hunt long and hard enough, they don’t appear on the surface where most of the story takes place, and it can be tricky to sniff out the exact partners you want to balance your team. Meanwhile, above ground, every other Pokémon is a Geodude, and there still aren’t enough fire-types to properly counter the hundred or so Bronzor you’ll inevitably have to fight. Pokémon X and Y. Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl feel slightly more difficult than other recent Pokémon games as a result, as the remakes seem at least somewhat (if not entirely) rebalanced around the addition of the controversial Experience Share mechanic that gives your entire party experience from battles rather than just battle participants. Those newer to Pokémon or used to Let’s Go or Sword and Shield might be caught off guard, but this grizzled veteran enjoyed the genuine challenge of compiling a crew that wouldn’t get curb stomped by the Elite Four the second I walked in. The smaller roster also makes PokéDex completion and collection much more fun and straightforward. While Diamond and Pearl pioneered the series’ online play, they still recognized its limitations, and thus monster collection is still designed around catching ‘em all yourself and maybe trading with your one friend who has the other version. Again, this is all just incidental to the remake being a pretty faithful one, but when the Pokémon series has about doubled the size of its creature index since the last time most people played Diamond and Pearl, the pared-down roster takes on a new, nostalgic light. You know, for the good ol’ days before Pokémon were ice cream cones (okay actually I like the ice cream cones, sorry, sorry). Despite an almost fanatical faithfulness, there are a handful of places where ILCA was able to put its own, clear stamp on what Pokémon can be, albeit to mixed results. Its remixes of the original Diamond and Pearl soundtrack, which admittedly wasn’t giving ILCA one of Game Freak’s best albums to work with, are almost entirely forgettable. And the tapping rhythm game mechanic added in Pokémon Super Contests doesn’t lean into actual rhythm game goofiness nearly as hard as I wished it had. Without the delightful excess of the original’s dress-up, dance, and performance phases, the whole activity loses its allure. One of the biggest changes in Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl is to the Grand Underground, a cavern maze you can access anywhere in Sinnoh once you acquire an Explorer’s Kit. Like Diamond and Pearl, you can dig into the walls and play an amusing little minigame to find treasure – but unlike Diamond and Pearl, you’ll also stumble upon rooms filled with wild Pokémon wandering on the map that you can encounter, battle, and catch. These Pokémon’s levels will scale up with you as you progress, and even more kinds will appear after you finish filling the Sinnoh PokéDex. You can also create a Secret Base in the Grand Underground and fill it with special statues you dig up to lure certain types of Pokémon. It’s a delightfully massive space, easy to get lost in for hours as you try to scope out that next hidden cavern up ahead, and a marked improvement over the already-excellent Underground of the original. Finally, look out for Diglett and Dugtrio randomly popping up in the tunnels. Maybe if you find all of them, something interesting will happen… But to its credit, ILCA actively shows up Game Freak in a few other areas. The aforementioned tweaks to the Grand Underground that add areas where wild Pokémon roam freely on the map, and I could spend hours running around that maze. Its recreation of Diamond and Pearl in a 3D, chibi style is darling and surprisingly good-looking in action – with the exception of a couple brief, serious moments where it zooms in a bit too close on a too-cute villain monologuing about ending the world. I especially loved the cheeky opening moments of trainer battles in which the full character model would faithfully strike the exact (often silly) pose their Diamond and Pearl sprite used to take at the start of each battle before throwing their Pokéball and resuming more natural movement. Sinnoh in general also looks quite nice within the stylistic bounds ILCA set for itself. Though I wish it hadn’t just replicated the same standard tree every time it wanted a copse or had been a bit more creative with grass and flowers, other elements like Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl’s rippling lakes and detailed water and other surface reflections are so impressive and unlike anything I’ve seen in other Pokémon games that they warranted a moment of admiration. A similar amount of care and love was put into the diverse and detailed battle backdrops, both indoor and outdoor, which is another touch that feels especially poignant given the many battles that took place in white voids in Sword and Shield. I especially loved the thematically appropriate way Mt. Coronet looms in the background during all the outdoor fights, and the lovely lighting adjustments to the same spots at different times of day. Those, combined with other small, thoughtful touches (like having Pokémon follow you outside Amity Square and the ability to change outfits so Dawn doesn’t have to walk through waist-deep snow wearing a miniskirt) made me wish ILCA had either been given the freedom or had the desire to push a bit further outside the bounds of Diamond and Pearl for this remake. I badly want Game Freak to let ILCA take on future Pokémon games in the old top-down tradition, and I want to see what ILCA is willing and able to do with that tradition once the gloves come off. Go on, Game Freak: give ILCA the keys to some Black and White remakes too. Let ‘em go nuts. I dare you. If a good remake is defined by its loyalty to the original, then Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl are very good remakes indeed. They are Diamond and Pearl down to nearly every detail, looking nicer than ever before with a few small tweaks, most of which are pretty good ones. It leaves in some of the original’s roster flaws, but they’re largely forgivable if you’re like me and have some degree of nostalgia for a time when Pokémon’s scope was smaller. And yet, I can’t help but be disappointed that Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl weren’t braver in how they improved upon the originals in the same way other Pokémon remakes were, bringing even some now-historic improvements back to correct history’s mistakes. Of course, I still had a perfectly pleasant time revisiting both Sinnoh and the simultaneously simpler yet more challenging era of Pokémon that took place within it reminded me of a time when this series asked a bit more of us. "
179,Battlefield 2042 Review in Progress,7.0,"128 players simultaneously running into Battlefield 2042’s crowded warzones is a great example of why bigger can be better, but isn’t always. While chaotic gunfights are undoubtedly part of Battlefield’s charm, massive lobbies with that many players eventually became frustrating instead of fun – even in the limited time I was able to play during a three-day ""virtual review event"" held by EA earlier this week. Thankfully, its tense new Hazard Zone mode provides an interesting strategic alternative on a smaller scale, and its customizable Portal mode tools are an exciting glimpse at how its future could thrive. But 2042’s flashy, large-scale battles have left me wanting so far – but I have a ways to go before I'm ready to score it.   To pull back the curtain on what reviewers had access to before launch, I was able to play about 12 hours of Battlefield 2042 spread across three days, meaning I couldn’t just queue into any mode I wanted and was restricted to what was available that day and hour. For example, we spent one day playing just the All-Out Warfare modes, and only had about an hour to play Breakthrough on the first day and another chunk the next day. In that time, I only barely experienced the massive new weather system – I saw one tornado, but it didn’t make it across the map to me. So I'm still chasing the storms. That means this review event felt more like a small window into each of Battlefield 2042’s modes rather than a full experience of it, so I’ll be waiting to do a full review until I’ve spent more time with it on live servers. Look for that next week! That said, I did play more than enough to form some initial impressions on what it has to offer. Most notably, its traditional All-Out Warfare mode feels underwhelming compared to the pleasant surprise that is the unconventional Hazard Zone, its customizable Portal is an absolutely incredible window into game development, and it basically throws the conventional class system out the window – and not entirely for the better.  At first glance it appears that Battlefield 2042 has a roster of 10 Specialists that are based off of the original four Battlefield classes: Assault, Support, Recon, and Engineer. However, unlike the previous Battlefield games where classes had very specific jobs and skills, 2042’s Specialists’ skills don’t really change a team’s dynamic much. For example, I first decided to go with Support Specialist Maria Falck to act as the team medic. Her Specialty skill arms her with a Syrette Pistol that fires syringes which heal allies and herself, but damage enemies. I initially thought Falck would basically be the only option for someone who likes to play as a medic, but it turns out that anyone can go in as a healer if they equip the medical crate gadget which lets them throw out the typical Battlefield area-of-effect healing box. And while Falck’s Specialist trait allows her to revive downed teammates to full health, anyone can revive their teammates and can provide healing. Similarly, anyone can hold a repair tool, so that’s no longer specific to Engineers, and any Specialist can even equip any gun. There are Specialists who have more unique abilities, like Casper getting an OV-P Recon Drone and Sundance getting a wingsuit instead of a parachute, but overall the Specialists’ loadouts don’t feel as distinctive as the roles we played in previous Battlefield games. I eventually found myself primarily picking Webster Mackay, whose Specialty is a grappling hook, and equipping the medical crate to get maximum mobility while still being able to play support.  Not having the usual class items exclusive to specific Specialists makes selecting a class feel less restrictive, but it struck me as odd that there also isn’t really any reason for a team to all go with separate classes when anyone can repair, heal, use anti-aircraft and anti-artillery equipment, and deploy ammo crates. That’s a fun addition, but this 2042 roster fails to really bring in the importance of individual classes as a result – everyone is a Jack of all trades, which lessens the need for coordinated squad building and teamwork. It can still be done, but the community will have to come up with a shorthand for each role instead of just saying “We need someone to play Support!”   There are three game types in 2042, and your leveling is shared across the board. The main event, All-Out Warfare, has within it the Breakthrough and Conquest modes, which both live up to that label with a whopping 64 players on each team. With that many people gunning for each other on one battlefield everything feels chaotic, even spread out across the impressively huge and gorgeously detailed maps that have been made to better accommodate that player count. Conquest is the traditional Battlefield mode where you compete to capture and hold multiple points spread around a massive map at the same time, only this time the map size and player count is turned up to 11. As much as I wanted to like Conquest here and certainly have enjoyed it in past Battlefields, this my least preferred mode in 2042 so far – during the review event, it felt like every point I went to try to take had the entire enemy team defending it because there are just so many players and only a few points that are easily reachable. It’s the kind of problem that takes a huge amount of teamwork to solve, and with the teams as big as they are that’s very difficult to pull off.  At the same time, the map is big enough that you don’t always run into anybody else in the vast spaces between points, and that leads to a problem where you’re just stuck running for excessive periods if you don’t have a vehicle drop-in available and if your team spawns are far from another point. It’s a bigger inconvenience than it was in Battlefield 5, where I didn’t feel as if I was running forever just to get to another point and the matches felt pretty evenly paced without so much dead air. Like a fresh recruit, Battlefield V was clearly deployed into action without adequate preparation. And a variety of bugs, underdeveloped features, and placeholder menu screens remind you of that at nearly every turn. However, there’s a great deal of raw potential here that could, with time and luck, be forged into one of the series’ best. Bold changes to Battlefield’s traditional gunplay, essential resources, and team dynamics create a strong foundation. On the single-player front, Battlefield V presents three short but distinct vignettes that weirdly focus on small-scale stealth instead of bombastic vehicular warfare. Their successful story moments aren’t really enough to go out of your way for but they’re worth playing once you’re here. Overall, Battlefield V can be lots of fun to play today, even if there’s still a lot of building left to do. Breakthrough returns in 2042 as well and it doesn’t see many changes from previous games. It puts your team on either attack or defense, but with the catch that each zone the attacking team captures can’t be recaptured. That means the defending team is pushed back to the next point, becoming increasingly desperate to hold onto the last one until respawn tickets run out. Again, it’s hard to execute any kind of real strategy this time around since your team is so big and there’s no clear leader – but when all of the action is focused on a single target, it can still be a lot of fun to run through the middle of this war to defend or attack a zone with the utter chaos of explosions and rampaging vehicles all around you. I’ve actually really enjoyed my rounds of Breakthrough because of that desperate tension when trying to hold a point and keep it from falling under enemy control with no way to get it back. It adds an extra layer of motivation to fight for each point. However, in my matches so far I’ve definitely noticed a problem with the balance favoring attackers. Because defenders can only spawn in the zone currently being attacked and can be easily surrounded by the attackers, I’ve already seen way too many hectic spawns where my teammates and I get obliterated by a tank immediately after coming back onto the map. The All-Out Warfare modes may be returning versions of Battlefield mainstays, but Hazard Zone is a brand-new game type that currently ranks as my second favorite of Battlefield 2042’s options. It’s not quite a battle royale, but if you do get killed you won’t be able to respawn unless a teammate is able to secure a respawn uplink to get you back. Each match has 32 players (unless you’re on last-gen consoles, in which case it’s 24) group up in teams of four to scour the map for data points, taking out both small swarms of AI soldiers and each other as they go, before extracting from the map. It’s not all about data points, though – throughout a match you can also loot Uplinks that allow you to call in Rangers (the robot dogs that are totally not inspired by Boston Dynamics own robots), a LATV4 Recon Vehicle, and Team Redeploys that allow you to bring back any dead teammates all at once. (I greatly prefer that to games where I have to revive them one at a time!) If you didn’t bring these with you, Uplinks can be lifesavers and create exciting moments – if you’re the last one standing on your team, a nearby Team Redeploy will be pinged on the map for you to run to and loot for a dramatic save.  What’s great about Hazard Zone’s long-term appeal is the sense of progression: when loading into a match for the first time you can pick any Specialist (such as Falck the Healer and her healing syringe gun or Casper, the recon Specialist with his drone) but your loadout of weapons, gadgets, and tactical equipment is limited since you won’t have enough credits to get anything other than the freebees. Play a few more matches, though, and maybe even successfully extract once or twice, and you’ll earn enough credits to buy some sweet items for your next drop, such as any weapon of your choice that you can customize with attachments and increased data storage in your tactical slot, allowing you to carry and extract with more data points. My favorite weapon in Hazard Zone was the M5A3 assault rifle with two scope attachment options for a 1x close range option and 2x at slightly further range.  The clever part about this is that the stakes keep rising higher as you go thanks to Extraction Streaks, where if you manage to extract two or more times in a row you’ll unlock an extra Tactical Equipment slot for the next match. If you lose that streak, however, you revert back to only one slot, and having something to lose ratchets up the tension a couple of notches when you’re wondering if you can take on that group of soldiers up ahead. Each streak is attached to the Specialist you used for the previous match as well, so if you switch from one Specialist to the other, you’ll lose that extra Tactical Equipment slot for the newly selected Specialist and essentially start over. This didn’t seem like a huge problem since the need to switch Specialists doesn’t really come up too often in Hazard Zone, but establishing the Specialist you want to use throughout the mode early is probably best. I found that Casper and his OV-P Recon drone was pretty handy to have on your team, especially since he could scope out areas with Data points and see how many hostiles are around.  The teamwork needed to survive and go from one data point to another is crucial, and since there are “only” 32 players in a match it felt slightly better paced and deliberate than All-Out Warfare’s chaos. I found myself eager to queue in for another match of Hazard Zone even if I had been absolutely demolished at the beginning of a previous game because I wanted to rack up points to get my best loadout in the next round.  I don’t know if it was a bug or what, but no matter what weapon types and attachments I tried, it felt like I often had to continue shooting an enemy for a few bullets longer than I should’ve needed to to down them. That got frustrating quickly, especially when some enemies seemed to be able to down me just about instantly while I was at full health. The TTK in the custom Portal modes I got to play felt fine since they worked off previous Battlefield games’ TTK speeds, but it stood out enough elsewhere that I’ll be testing it a lot more and getting other IGN editors’ impressions before my final review. In All-Out Warfare, the long TTK didn’t bother me too much since you respawn pretty quickly and can get back in the action, but in Hazard Zone it felt especially punishing since it’s a squad-based game and you stay down until you can be revived. Unlike Apex Legends or Call of Duty: Warzone where you can potentially take on three enemies at once if your teammates are downed, it feels nearly impossible in Battlefield 2042. Being surrounded by even two enemies always felt like a death sentence.  Another problem was an ongoing bug where I’d occasionally run over to revive a downed teammate only to find that they’d already chosen to die and spawn back in, yet their bodies remained on the ground like bait in a medic trap. Being downed seems to be buggy in general, because other times I’d be waiting for a revive but my teammate wouldn’t be able to get a revive icon on me, so I’d just have to accept death and respawn. But on the whole, the technical issues I saw weren’t too bad, especially when compared to the worrying bug bonanza we saw during the beta a few weeks back. More of a massive playground than a set mode, it lets all of us create our own experiences, game modes, or even just new game rules in general. It lets you tailor what kind of Battlefield you want to play, packing loads of the series’ long history into one great big developer toolset.  It includes three full classic Battlefield games that you can customize: the original Battlefield 1942, Battlefield Bad Company 2, and Battlefield 3. There are maps, weapons, classes, and equipment available from all these plus (naturally) 2042. There are a few preset, dev team-curated modes that you can jump into, including Battlefield 1942 Classic Conquest, Battlefield Bad Company 2 Classic Rush, and Battlefield 3 Classic Conquest. Playing Battlefield Bad Company 2’s Classic Rush mode in a match with 64 players using that game’s actual ruleset and maps felt so, so good, and it was a stark difference from how I felt about playing All-Out Warfare in Battlefield 2042’s main game mode list. I’ve only dabbled in 1942’s Classic Conquest mode so far, but sniping there is fantastic. Playing these games in Portal reminded me of how fun Battlefield can be, especially with the classic modes where classes actually matter to team balance compared to 2042’s new Specialists. But the real fun comes from tweaking things yourself. In Portal, you can change anything from if Friendly Fire is on for a team, to how much headshot damage multipliers are valued at, to if you take fall damage, and more. Basically anything you can think to change in a game, you can. Not only does it let you create entirely unique Battlefield experiences and game modes, but it could also be a tool to provide a more hands-on understanding of game development and what goes into game balancing. Portal can also be used to make incredibly silly stuff, like one dev-created mode I played where you have a single rocket in a launcher as your primary and a knife as your secondary; in order to reload you have to jump five times. Why? Because it’s goofy madness and there are no rules in Portal, that’s why.  The tools that Portal gives you can be overwhelming to look at because it goes all the way down into the skeleton of game development tools – that’s an incredible level of freedom, but it also means it isn’t necessarily the most accessible custom mode maker an FPS has ever seen. (I wasn’t able to mess around with Portal’s tools myself during the review event, but a page went live on Battlefield 2042’s site that allows you to test out all the settings it has available.) And the good news is that you don’t need to learn any of it to enjoy the smartest and craziest stuff out there, because finding community-created modes has been made easy – there will be featured custom modes available at launch and a rotating selection that could be seen by the community on the front page of Portal.  After a dozen hours with Battlefield 2042, it’s clear not all of its new ideas are entirely successful, but the ones that are can be seriously impressive. The 128-player matches of its All-Out Warfare modes definitely feel like too much for their own good a lot of the time, but its more strategic new Hazard Zone mode is incredibly fun – and the customization tools Portal provides absolutely take the cake in terms of what could keep me interested long-term. I still have a lot more to play before I’m ready to put a final score on my review, but I’m at least excited to keep playing. Stella is a Video Producer, Host, and Editor at IGN. Her gameplay focus is on competitive FPS games and she is also a shoutcaster/host on Apex Legends tournaments outside of IGN. You can follow her on Twitter @ParallaxStella. Battlefield 2042 tries to do a lot, but only some of its experiments are worth celebrating. The 128 player matches of its All-Out Warfare modes definitely feel like too much for their own good a lot of the time, but its more strategic new Hazard Zone mode is incredibly fun. But the fact that the most fun I had with 2042 was playing recreations of its previous games in Portal is a pretty good indication of how ideas like its new Specialist system have missed the mark. For a game claiming to be the future of Battlefield, 2042’s impressive Portal options make it clear that it doesn’t stack up to the past. Instead, it’s those same customization tools that could come to define it in time. "
180,Call of Duty: Vanguard - Zombies Review in Progress,7.0,"Note: This review covers the Zombies mode of Call of Duty: Vanguard. For our thoughts on the other two modes, check out our Call of Duty: Vanguard Single-Player Campaign review and our Call of Duty Vanguard Multiplayer review in progress.Call of Duty: WW2. And for anyone who spent their high school years boarding up the windows when Zombies debuted in Treyarch’s Call of Duty: World of War, Sledgehammer's interpretation is both a homecoming and a living testament to how far the mode has iterated beyond its original form. After the scant couple of hours we were given with it at a “virtual review event” over the past couple of days, I can confirm that Vanguard is attempting to fuse a number of different interesting genre influences to Zombies, albeit with some noticeable missing features. I’ll need to play a lot more to see how they pan out when it comes to sustaining interest in Zombies while we wait for more content to arrive, but here are my thoughts so far.  The basics are right in place. You and three friends have been transported into a hellish, phantasmagoric alternative universe — red skies, cursed talismans, eldritch gods — about a million miles removed from the steely realism prioritized by the mainline Call of Duty games and Vanguard’s own campaign and multiplayer modes. I've always loved how Zombies lets Call of Duty stretch its legs into a brutal, Doom-y aesthetic, and Sledgehammer proudly heaps on the gore. There's some melodrama around the margins: the Nazis have wandered too deep into their occult obsession and have unleashed grotesque perdition in the ruins of Stalingrad, and they'll tell you all about their sins in audio logs that can and probably should be easily ignored. We are here to kill hordes of zombies using the same slick first-person shooting mechanics that have preserved Call of Duty’s spot as a mainstay for nearly two decades, and that part still feels great. The weightiness of 1940s firearm engineering was always a natural pairing for our Van Helsing fantasies; you take the front two windows, I'll take the back door, and we'll keep firing our Tommy guns we're out of bullets. What’s new this year is an element of randomness on each run. A Sledgehammer developer told me roguelites like Hades were influential during development, and that influence jumps out immediately. A lot of your time in Vanguard's Zombies will be spent between runs, dawdling around a war-torn hub zone (a la Dark Souls’ Firelink Shrine or Destiny’s The Traveller) where you can juice firearms, craft weaponry, and swap in powerful buffs called Covenants that might give you a kickback of health with every melee kill or revive allies faster, and so on. Those merge nicely with Vanguard's four ultimate abilities – a devastating energy mine, an invisibility field, a party-wide damage inductor, and a speed-dampening vortex – which fit into the usual DPS/Tank/Healer class balance setup, and add a few more thoughtful flourishes to the action. I can report that booby-trapping a spawn point with a screen-filling explosive is just as satisfying as you'd think it'd be. However, most of the boosts you can buy struck me as pretty uninspiring and I found myself thirsting for augmentations that are a bit more colorful than quicker animations. Part of that is because they pale when compared to the randomized bonuses you find when you’re out and about on the maps. Case in point: one power-up I found basically gives you the Golden Gun from GoldenEye – every zombie you tag, regardless of location, immediately keels over. It's so much more fun than all of the expensive stuff around headquarters, but of course it’s all up to the luck of the draw. The goal of all of this, I think, is to bring those eureka! moments found in the roguelikes Sledgehammer is cribbing from into Zombies’ action; when all the statistical integers meld together in a sublime miracle run, like catching lightning in a bottle. Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War’s Zombies is as highly polished and tense as you’d expect from a mode that’s been around in some form or another for over a decade now. The iconic brand of frantic zombie killing and interdimensional intrigue is incredibly fun while you’re caught up in the moment, but it doesn’t build enough on what came before. Compared to Black Ops 4’s ambitious Zombies mode that launched with multiple episodes, this single map feels like a disappointment, and the lack of local split-screen co-op is a bummer as well. It should get bigger and better as Treyarch adds new free maps and features, and if so this could become a great year for Call of Duty Zombies. All of those upgrade stations demand currency you earn out in the killing fields, which means that Zombies follows a rigid formula: take one of the outlying portals to an instanced challenge – such as survive an onslaught, escort a floating skull, or power up obelisks – and then minmax your build back at basecamp. Those three flavors serve up plenty of undead to kill, but they weren't quite as dynamic as I hoped. The onslaught, in particular, puts you in extremely tight corridors for about two minutes while you fend off the herd. I kept waiting for an unexpected left-hook to knock me off my guard, but it never came. Again, maybe the challenges grow more complex the deeper you get into Zombies, but right now, I'm finding them a little monotonous. Once four objectives are complete, the squad can exfiltrate out of the hotspot and back into safety... or they can push forward, knowing that the difficulty escalates with every victory. Win or lose, all the Covenants you've unlocked and perks you've purchased disappear at the end of a run, but you'll earn extra experience points on the Call of Duty ranking system with a successful escape. As with so many horror games, our greatest fear is not about the monsters lurking around the corner; no, it's the threat of starting over from scratch. This gets to the base of Vanguard's appeal. Sledgehammer wants you to bleed over your character sheet; to page through the network of weapons, Covenants, and the remaining miscellaneous accoutrements to create the apex zombie-killing machine. I’m sure I’ll get to that point after more than a few hours with it, but thus far my teammates and I have had no choice but to slap together builds basically blindly, with no coordination or foresight, and running into the line of fire as recklessly as possible. There’s nothing terribly wrong with that, since Zombies has always been amiable to mindless fun. But it’s going to take some time before I can say whether Sledgehammer has designed its perks in such a way that gives Vanguard some extra afterlife. But the main issue with the latest round of Zombies is that, simply put, it feels a little thin right now. There is an efficient undead-killing infrastructure here, but Sledgehammer says that a ""main quest,"" which sounds a lot like the more story-driven, scripted rendition of Zombies we've seen in Call of Dutys of yore, won’t arrive until December 2 – nearly a full month after the initial rollout. Until then, we'll be crunching through a series of disconnected combat arenas, adding up to what should be some incredible combos and oodles of viscera, but not much else. Because of the tardiness of the traditional story content, after only two hours it felt like Vanguard’s levels had already lost the capacity to surprise me; that all of the fascinating mysteries in this macabre dimension were already tapped. That was a disconcerting feeling to have almost immediately, and I hope it doesn't bear truth when I play more on live servers over the weekend before I write my final review. Vanguard has the bones and the brains down brilliantly, now it just needs some blood. With a strong cast of characters used to varying effect throughout to tell a tale that puts just about enough of a spin on the stories it's paying homage to, Call of Duty: Vanguard’s single-player campaign is an impressively cinematic depiction of World War II. That said, aside from a few standout moments sprinkled over its fleeting five hours, for the most part it plays it a little too safe in regards to mission variety to feel like a standout in the series. It may look and sound spectacular, but it could’ve used more stylish sections like Petrova’s to distinguish its gameplay from the many battles we’ve fought before. "
181,Call of Duty: Vanguard - Single-Player Campaign ,7.0,"Note: This review covers the single-player campaign of Call of Duty: Vanguard. For our thoughts on the other two modes, check our our Call of Duty: Vanguard Multiplayer review in progress and our Call of Duty: Vanguard Zombies review in progress.Call of Duty World War II story, however, than Inglourious Basterds. Its tale of a small group of expert soldiers on a secret mission to stop the Third Reich may sound familiar to anyone who has seen the 2009 movie, but Vanguard plays it with a much straighter face than Tarantino ever could. Even so, Vanguard’s campaign is over quickly, and its small series of battles are all too rarely memorable high points.  Any story is only as good as its villains, and with these Nazis you really can’t go wrong in that department. Two high-ranking German officers serve as a one-two punch in this regard and have a lovely time chewing the scenery whilst dancing the (Christoph) Waltz. Dan Donohue’s Chief Gestapo Interrogator Freisinger provides a chilling presence and commands every cutscene he stars in. On the other side of the coin is Lost and Lord of the Rings’ Dominic Monaghan, who plays the quieter but cunning Jannick Richter. His snake-like demeanor manages to spark fear despite looking quite a bit like a fascist Elton John. Forming the world’s first Special Forces unit is one elite operator from four of the Allied countries: Britain, the Soviet Union, Australia, and the USA. All are competently performed and add their own quirks to the dynamic: British Sergeant Arthur Kingsley is a stoic, level-headed leader; Aussie Riggs and American Jackson battle it out to be the biggest maverick of the group (the former probably wins due to his fetish for explosives and lack of respect for any form of authority; but it’s Laura Bailey’s Polina Petrova who by far offers the most compelling character. As a result, it’s no surprise she’s at the centre of Vanguard’s best moments. To introduce each member and give us an insight into their personalities, we’re taken on missions from their past that helped shape them as fighters. It’s a neat structure to the campaign because it lets us visit numerous locations on different fronts of the war while still maintaining a coherent plotline. Sure, most of these missions don’t tell us much about the backgrounds of the protagonists apart from “they’re quite good at shooting”, but Petrova’s leans much more heavily into the emotions of war. Taking place during the horrific and lengthy Battle of Stalingrad, we get a glimpse of her Russian family life before the German invasion. Although a small-scale scene in comparison, it's this calm before the storm that adds a huge amount of emotional weight to her arc and makes her feel like a fully fleshed-out character. The credit here can be shared between the poignant writing and Bailey’s masterful performance – understated when it needs to be, but explosive when the occasion calls for it. It’s just a shame that the same attention isn’t paid to the other members of the team in this regard. Polina has the standout mission in snowy Stalingrad – it’s one that puts all of her sharpshooting and stealth skills to the test. The war-torn city has a deathly post-apocalyptic atmosphere to it that doesn't feel too far removed from another game series Bailey appeared in not too long ago. This section showcases the best bits of Vanguard with a big emphasis placed on movement in sections. Polina has the added abilities of being able to climb certain walls and squeeze through small gaps at pace, and that can turn certain encounters into a Hell on Earth version of Doom at times: you have to vault and jump around architecture, dodging and decapitating foes. Call of Duty’s moment-to-moment gameplay is still primarily a well-dressed shooting gallery, but Black Ops Cold War succeeds in making its quiet time a defining part of its experience rather than just a deep breath between the loud and explode-y sequences. Its story is less successful at leaving a Black Ops 1-level mark, but the importance placed on finding and deciphering evidence as well as the multiple endings give good reason to stick with it beyond its typical six-ish-hour runtime. – Ryan McCaffrey, November 12, 2020Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War Single-Player Campaign ReviewRed Dead-style. But none feels quite as fun or fluid as Petrova’s added movement capabilities. It kind of just made me wish that I was playing as her the whole time, rather than switching back to her less interesting comrades. Especially when all the best missions are hers. On the whole, the list of missions is solid if not spectacular. A couple of other highlights include an exciting dogfight during the Battle of Midway and a tense farmhouse encounter after you drop in solo the night before D-Day during Operation Tonga. It’s a sequence that is visually stunning and not only pays homage to war cinema, but also Call of Duty’s own storied history: Tonga played a key part in the original game in the series back in 2003. All in all, though, there’s just not the variety in mission design that we’ve come to expect from a Call of Duty campaign, especially when compared to the heights that both the Modern Warfare and Black Ops series have reached. You’ll have boots on the ground running from objective marker to objective marker for the vast majority of Vanguard’s brief five-hour runtime. That’s quick even for a Call of Duty campaign – according to HowLongtoBeat.com, this is roughly tied with Black Ops Cold War as the shortest in the whole series. There just seems to be some missed opportunities here, especially when it comes to an almost complete lack of vehicles or special “one-off” weapons to use during big moments. It’s especially mind-boggling that you’d play a mission as one of the Desert Rats during The Battle of El Alamein (one of the most famous tank battles in history) and not get inside a tank once.  That being said, Vanguard’s gunplay is of a very high standard and is as snappy as you'd expect from Call of Duty. You’re propelled through levels with an emphasis placed on pushing the enemy rather than taking cover and holding your ground. The ability to now slide left to right while mounted on cover is a very welcome addition for when the rare time to hunker down does arise, though. Guns feel distinct from one another; ranging from the suitably rickety recoil of the MP40 to the satisfyingly powerful kick of the Kar98. The sound design is also on point as bullets whizz past and explosions ring out for what feels like the full five hours. Further adding volume to these theatres is God of War composer Bear McCreary’s fantastic music, which soundtracks some of Vanguard’s most cinematic moments perfectly. A couple of standouts that stick in the mind are a soaring score that plays at the climax of the Bougainville campaign and a particularly tense piece that sounds like an orchestral Stuka bomber screech. Vanguard is equally visually striking throughout too, whether that be the hostile greens of the Solomon Islands or shell flashes illuminating enemy silhouettes in the mist of nighttime Normandy. Facial animations are also noticeably impressive – it’s hard to believe many games stack up against Call of Duty when it comes to graphical quality of its cutscenes. All these factors combine to create a wholly cinematic experience, albeit one that meanders towards the finish line. The individual missions can play it fairly safe, but when the team comes together during both the opening and closing salvos of the story, it all starts to sing. It’s just quite underwhelming that this happens rarely in Vanguard, with the stars of the show being kept apart from each other for the vast majority. There’s a lot to like here, and the ending is as satisfyingly explosive as its beginning. It just feels a few more risks could’ve been taken along the way. With a strong cast of characters used to varying effect throughout to tell a tale that puts just about enough of a spin on the stories it's paying homage to, Call of Duty: Vanguard’s single-player campaign is an impressively cinematic depiction of World War II. That said, aside from a few standout moments sprinkled over its fleeting five hours, for the most part it plays it a little too safe in regards to mission variety to feel like a standout in the series. It may look and sound spectacular, but it could’ve used more stylish sections like Petrova’s to distinguish its gameplay from the many battles we’ve fought before. "
182,Shin Megami Tensei V ,8.0,"Shin Megami Tensei V feels like the edgier, less sociable younger brother of Persona 5, even though Persona began as a spin-off to the series. Both branches of the family share much of their cast of highly customizable demons, like mythological Pokemon you smash together to make even more powerful ones. They have similar, excellent turn-based combat systems that encourage you to fish for your opponents' weaknesses and make smart use of every resource available to you. What's missing from the Persona formula here is a lot of its heart, but Shin Megami Tensei V still rises to succeed in most other ways. The bulk of the action takes place across four expansive, open areas of the Netherworld: an alternate reality reflecting a post-apocalyptic Tokyo crawling with mythological beasts and heroes. They range from the sun-baked desert expanse of Minato to the gloomy, blood red badlands of Shinagawa, and each one echoes an area of real-world Tokyo with ruined buildings and major landmarks jutting out of the wastes. They all have a very distinct vibe, diverging from a central theme of surreal, techno-religious weirdness. While you'll fight lots of intense battles within them, these bizarre cityscapes also encourage exploration and even involve some tricky platforming to find all of the hidden Miman – little red dudes who give you a currency you can use on miraculous bonuses for your whole party or to customize the protagonist.  And customization is the main pillar of SMT5. Since there are no human party members who stay with you the whole adventure, you'll build a rotating team of three demons who all have their own strengths, weaknesses, and special tricks. Fusing two or more demons into stronger ones is central to your progression, but you can also hoard items called grimoires that let you continue powering up a couple specific demons you want to keep with you for the long haul, which I really appreciated. Gaining new demons involves a negotiation system which requires learning each demon's personality and what kind of responses will please them, which admittedly seemed overly random at times. But it could also be pretty funny when I picked what seemed like the perfect response only to have the rug pulled out from under me by an unexpected objection – like a vainglorious fairy who runs away if you call her beautiful because she's too shy to handle such a compliment, or an unhinged horse demon who only takes a liking to you if you insult him repeatedly. Things really get interesting when you factor in the essence system, though, which lets you teach skills from a different demon to an existing one, and even inherit their elemental resistances and weaknesses. Between fusion, miracles, and essences, it's possible to create some absurdly powerful and specialized teams that can take on almost any challenge. The way these systems interact isn't spelled out especially well, but I really enjoyed the gradual path to mastering them myself through trial and error. A hunger to experiment is a huge plus in this netherworld. And mastery is basically a necessity unless you want to play on the easier difficulty. Shin Megami Tensei has a reputation for being brutally difficult as a series, and I was able to see why, even on its Normal mode. Just using the strongest demons I came across naturally, I often got chewed up and spit out pretty quickly – especially against certain bosses and in the last quarter of the story. But that's only until I realized that the real challenge was in meticulously creating the perfect team for each area, and sometimes even each fight. All of the tools are there, and if you know how to use them, you can blow right past enemies that once seemed unbeatable. But there is no mercy to be found if you don't, so going in with the right mindset is a must. There's also a fair bit of grinding involved if you want to keep pace with the challenges ahead, which isn't that unexpected for a JRPG. It definitely drags on at times when you might have to fight the same group of enemies 10, 15, or even 20 times in the same area to level up. Some sort of randomized battle modifier just to shake things up now and then would have been really welcome. Again, I think about the Showtime attacks and unstable shadows added in the Royal version of Persona 5 as examples of how Atlus has tackled this problem successfully in the past. You can skip some amount of grinding by cleverly exploiting a specific enemy type that you'll have to figure out for yourself, but you can't avoid it entirely – especially toward the very end. When you're not exploring and battling your way through the wastelands, you'll spend a few short interludes back in the non-apocalyptic version of Tokyo, which felt kind of like an unnecessary minigame. You move a little pawn around a zoomed-out cityscape where there's really not much to do or interact with, but these segments are generally over before you know it. Each chapter also concludes with a substantial mega dungeon – though only one of the three, a hellish fortress complete with challenging jumping puzzles, felt significantly different from the rest of the adventure. The other two are mostly just hallways filled with monsters. The final dungeon sort of half tries to introduce an interesting new mechanic with doorways that start and stop time when you pass through them, but it ends up being less of a puzzle and more of a way to force you to backtrack. The solutions were all too mindlessly straightforward to feel like I'd accomplished anything. The other area where SMT5 consistently fell short for me was the writing. It takes upwards of 20 hours to find any personal motivation beyond survival and figuring out what's going on, and the companion characters are also very under-developed. You don't get to spend enough time with most of them for one thing, since they don't usually join you in battle or even have their own side stories. You run into them for a few minutes during cutscenes after many hours of adventuring, and none of them seem to have in-depth backgrounds or even much of a character arc. They exist mostly as decoration on a story that cares more about big concepts than people. The main story is definitely interesting at least, and not just another rehash of God vs Satan for control of humanity's destiny. While I won't spoil anything, the three possible endings are a bit more nuanced than that. Although, your decisions right up to the moment you ""lock in"" to one path don't seem to affect them at all, and things become pretty convoluted at the very end. It introduces an entirely new metaphysical concept through an expository dialogue dump at basically the last possible moment, which seems meant to recontextualize the whole situation, but then doesn't really explain how it works or even what exactly happened with it after the final battle. This left the last hour or so feeling like a somewhat cold, confusing conclusion to an epic, 80-hour undertaking I otherwise enjoyed. At least the art throughout is exceptional. It's every bit as visually stylish as any other Atlus game, and I love the design of the main character. The demons, both new and familiar to series veterans, look and sound awesome, and have some fantastic unique attack animations. There are definitely some framerate issues in certain areas though, and details like grass that only pop in when you're very close can be distracting. Atlus really tried to push the limits of the Switch's hardware, and it's a gamble that pays off in some spots and not in others. On the other hand, the moody music is pretty great, too, even if it’s never as emotional or memorable as Persona's iconic vocal tracks. With extensive and satisfying party customization, excellent combat, and challenging enemies, Shin Megami Tensei V never left me feeling bored or burned out across its epic length. Exploration and platforming sections lend some much-needed variety when you're fighting so many similar battles in a row. I just couldn't shake the feeling that this was Persona without the heart – without the unforgettable companion characters, the potent personal story, the incredible soundtrack, and the jaw-dropping twists and turns. Still, if you're looking for a meaty, demanding, endlessly deep, and overall outstanding JRPG to sink your teeth into, Shin Megami Tensei V has heaping portions of it. "
183,Forza Horizon 5 ,10.0,"As Forza Horizon 5 crosses the finish line, the bar for open-world racing has again been raised in so many different ways. A map of Mexico that’s bigger, higher, and wildly more varied than any Horizon game yet. A fresh change to the way the Horizon Festival itself is gradually constructed, which results in more one-off events deliberately designed to showcase Horizon 5 at its very best. Improved tools that allow us to build completely custom events that can be more or less indistinguishable from those crafted by the developers themselves. An enormous visual upgrade, especially to lighting, tyre smoke, and dust effects. Hundreds and hundreds of new custom parts, rims, and performance mods, and cars with more character than ever. Drastic sound improvements, better handling, more granular preferences and options, more online activities. It really is incredible across the board.  To understand just how big Forza Horizon 5 is, we have to briefly look back at Forza Horizon 4, which truly ballooned into an absolute colossus of a racing game back in 2018. Playground Games had taken the impeccable open-world racing of all the Horizon games to date, then stuffed in simulated seasons, a shared-world multiplayer overhaul, and a shift in how the team told their mini automotive stories. But that was day one; Playground then spent another three years cramming in even more things to do. The Festival Playlist, where new activities were available every week. The Eliminator, Horizon’s very clever and effective take on bringing the battle royale format to a racing game. The Super7, where we could participate in custom-built racing, driving, and stunt-based challenges made by others, plus create and share our own. What’s impressive is that Forza Horizon 5 isn’t just all this airlifted to a different part of the world; it’s that it’s all this and a remarkable amount more. I’ll always have a massive soft spot for the down under delights of Forza Horizon 3, but open-world racing has never looked as good as it does in Forza Horizon 4. It combines a beautiful world that’s really four hugely distinct maps in one with a constantly rewarding and self-renewing racing experience and I really can’t tear myself away from it. Playground Games hasn’t just upped the ante once again; it’s blown the bloody doors off. The breadth of Playground’s wonderfully diverse map of Mexico is exceptional, and it comes as an extremely exotic and interesting array of environments to get lost in after three years in Horizon 4’s beautiful but broadly more-uniform Britain. Horizon 5’s tapestry of colourful locations and backdrops more closely resembles Horizon 3, but it feels noticeably more extensive than even Playground’s remarkable 2016 riff on Australia. There’s Baja, where the sun-baked tarmac hugs the coast as the parched, sandy desert blends into the beach, and deep jungle, where muddy tracks criss-cross through ancient temples, abandoned airstrips, and thickets. There’s the charmingly colourful city of Guanajuato and its maze-like network of cobblestone streets and tunnels, contrasted with a sleepy coastal town flanked by the ocean on one side and mangroves on the other. There’s rolling green farmland draped in crops and windswept grass, and also a picturesque gorge that looks like it’s been plucked from a Western movie. There’s the semi-arid desert of the map’s interior, filled with towering cacti and stubborn shrubs, and the high and rocky volcanic peak of Gran Caldera. There’s even a giant stadium for soccer shenanigans. It’s not exactly a perfect recreation, of course – as with all Horizon worlds to date it pays no mind to reality, smooshing together a stylised vision of Mexico at its most interesting. The result is a fantastic map – and the biggest in the series so far by a striking margin. That size is best observed from atop the Gran Caldera Volcano. The Playground Games team has stressed that it’s the highest point in any Horizon game, but you won’t have to take their word for it – just drive up there and you’ll see how much it dwarfs both Horizon 3’s Blizzard Mountain and Horizon 4’s Fortune Island expansions. The massive elevation change not only provides one of the best roads in the series to date – a switchback-filled mountain run I expect will become a drift mecca for the sideways squad – but it’s a killer display of Horizon 5’s immense draw distance. I love games that make me feel small in a vast new space, and Horizon 5 does this very effectively. The garage is just as grand as the map itself, with well over 500 vehicles, and it’s a selection that still handily eclipses all Forza Horizon’s open-world racing rivals. Granted, there isn’t a huge number of cars that are strictly new to the franchise – and those of us who stuck around Forza Horizon 4 each week for the last few years collecting every new car will have seen the lion’s share of them before – but Playground has assuaged that slightly with the addition of a lot of new rim options and visual upgrades that may help breathe new life into cars you’ve seen a lot of previously. Changes to the livery editor also see it support higher resolution designs and graphics... but you still can’t place decals on glass, which remains a shame. Between the cars and the map, however, Forza Horizon 5 is barnstormingly gorgeous on both fronts. On Xbox Series X that’s true of both the 4K/30FPS quality mode and the 4K/60FPS performance mode. I’ve been playing mostly on quality mode since the frame rate never, ever wavers in either mode – remaining rock solid at all times and in all conditions – but know that the visual concessions in performance mode are generally so small I need to study freeze frames to spot the difference anyhow. It’s tough to pick my favourite visual element of Horizon 5, but think it might just be the drastically better smoke and dust effects – and especially how light interacts with the particles in the air. It looks brilliant. Of course, while Forza Horizon 5’s showstopping graphics are sucking most of the oxygen out of the room, there have been so many other improvements to the Horizon formula here it’s hard to know where to begin. The handling tweaks are deceptively extensive, with more authentic ABS braking, a snappier steering sensation, and suspension improvements that have resulted in a more convincing feel off-road. The radically revamped audio is superb, and the amount of cars that now sound blatantly different to each other has exploded. I especially love hearing the changes my performance parts are making to my car’s sound in real-time – nerdy behaviour which is encouraged by the ability to rev the engine during upgrade work. Even before launch, the new event-building tools are already resulting in some outstanding and creative courses, races, and activities being shared between early players. With considerably more props and far more granular options than Horizon 4’s building tools, I’m expecting some of the user-generated content for Horizon 5 is going to be mind-bendingly good. A rethink in how the career mode unfolds has seen Playground add a new points system that allows you to take charge of what event hubs and special races you want to prioritise unlocking. These points, or “Accolades,” are awarded for achieving major and minor feats, and essentially function as a dramatically expanded version of the Brick Challenges in Forza Horizon 4’s LEGO expansion. What this has allowed Playground to do is add a handful of additional curated drives to Horizon 5, which it’s dubbed Expeditions. These Expeditions inject a little bit of the flavour of the Horizon series’ fabulous but fleeting opening drive montages back into the main career, where Playground stage manages vehicles, the time-of-day lighting, and the weather for memorable journeys that showcase Horizon 5 at its very best. One has you racing through trees as lightning strikes the ground ahead, while another has you racing up and back down the rumbling volcano as jets of steam break through the ground around you. There’s been some significant multiplayer massaging, too; this time Playground has ditched ranked play for something less pressurised and that won’t penalise you for other people’s bad racing etiquette. Horizon 5’s PvP modes have been grouped under a single umbrella and are now designed to embrace new players as championships progress, meaning that unlike Horizon 4 it seems like we should no longer be marooned in dwindling groups of sore losers that haemorrhage players as races don’t go their way. The hourly Forzathon Live events from Horizon 4 have also been brushed aside in favour of the newly christened Horizon Arcade. It functions similarly to Forzathon Live – they’re still co-op events where everyone contributes to a common goal – but there’s a greater variety of events.  They can be a fun spectacle – particularly when dozens of piñatas are raining from the sky – but I do find they can descend into a bit of a slog when they go the full 10 minutes. Then there’s the tiny stuff, which still all adds up. A more intuitive car collection display which lets you quickly buy multiple new cars for your garage and skip the menu shuffling in the dealership screens. A cute activity where you hide cars from your own garage for other players to find inside barns you’ve discovered around the map. Hell, there’s finally even the ability to toggle between opting for metric measurements but retaining horsepower for power measurements. (Kilowatts are for vacuum cleaners.)  Forza Horizon 5 is a deep and nuanced car nirvana for revheads and auto geeks to endlessly collect, tinker, and experiment. It’s also an extremely accessible buffet of racing spectacle open to everyone, from Deluxe Edition diehards to Game Pass nomads – no matter their driving skill or mechanical knowledge. It’s an occasionally goofy but always earnest Valentine to Mexico’s world-famous culture, and a romantic ode to the magic of road-tripping through postcard-perfect vacation vistas. It’s a long haul, MMO-inspired racer that’s exploding with more races, activities, and event types than can comfortably fit on some parts of the map – and yet it still always feels relaxed rather than daunting. It never locks you into something you don’t want to do and steadily rewards you for however you choose to play it. It looks beautiful, it sounds magnificent, and it is glorious to play. Yes, Forza Horizon 5 is a lot of things. Above all, however, it is the result of a racing studio at the peak of its craft and the best open-world racing game I’ve ever played. "
184,ders Republic ,8.0,"Following in the footsteps of Ubisoft’s The Crew series before it, Rider’s Republic aims to cram the engine of a high-octane arcade racer under the hood of a sprawling online open world – except this time the engine is your legs and the hood is a bunch of extreme sports events so over the top it would make the late ‘90s blush. It’s a somewhat familiar formula, but what’s really impressive is that (with the notable and occasional game crash aside) it overwhelmingly succeeds at providing the ultimate downhill sports fantasy. Whether I was blasting into the sky in my rocket-powered wingsuit or sweating bullets as I completed obstacle courses on my bike, Riders Republic awoke the extreme sports fanatic inside me and kept me hooked for over 60 hours and counting. Riders Republic uses a structure that will be very recognizable if you’ve played any of The Crew or Forza Horizon games: you explore a beautiful open-world, participate in exciting races and trick contests, search for collectibles, and unlock better gear and more difficult activities as you go – only instead of driving vehicles cross-country, you’ll be swapping between a bicycle, wingsuit, snowboard, and pair of skis to scream down mountains. Riders Republic sticks very closely to the existing open-world racing game formula we’ve seen many times before, but having an extreme sports version of those racers is hardly a bad thing.  Whether you’re catching air in a snowboard trick competition or flying through said air in a wingsuit race, every one of Riders Republic’s sports is an absolute blast to take on. Riding bikes is all about precision and managing your peddling stamina meter, which becomes more challenging depending on your terrain. Riding a bike in the snow, for example, is a recipe for disaster that’s best avoided. Using your skis or a snowboard, on the other hand, is all about controlling your speed and momentum as you slide across more slippery locales. And in contrast to bike riding, skis and snowboards perform pretty terribly on harder terrain like dirt and pavement. Meanwhile, the wingsuit requires you to embrace your inner daredevil and glide or rocket dangerously close to hard objects at a terminal velocity. Mastering each machine of gnarliness Riders Republic offers is challenging, diverse, and guaranteed to result in a few hilarious but nasty spills. The events you’ll be using them in can be just as varied, throwing you down dozens of mountainsides with plenty of different goals to shake things up. Races make speed the name of the game, and they can be some seriously tense competitions that put your reflexes and guts to the test as you shred downhill, fly over gaps, and dodge obstacles. But you’ll also need to master your showoff skills in stunt contests where the key to success is pulling off tricks and grinding on rails to rack up points in the style of other arcade sports games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.  Mastering each course as I earned better gear, leveled up each of my extreme sport careers, and unlocked even more contests was consistently satisfying, and the incredible amount of things to do meant that loop never got stale. For example, after beating my head against a wall in a particularly challenging rocket wingsuit race, I took a break to play some snowboard trick contests and felt like I’d jumped into an entirely different game. With so much to do, I never felt burnt out with enough of Riders Republic to put it down for very long, and that’s an impressive feat considering how easy it usually is to bore me. The map is also downright loaded with other things to do as well, whether it’s collectibles to hunt for, lovely sights to see, or organic events to discover like hidden stunt activities – some of which ask you to complete insane task like clearing an impossibly large gap or riding a tiny steel beam across a canyon. Interestingly, the map takes seven real-world national parks and 45 actual landmarks and smashes them all together into one massive location, where the snowy Grand Teton Summit can sit comfortably next to the rocky Angel Arch. This bizarre mishmashing of real-world locations and impossibly diverse biomes all welded together is not only an awesome sight to behold, it makes one map feel like several, each with their own notable features, colorful landscapes, and wildly different paths to bomb down. Eventually you’ll level up enough to gain access to more difficult activities, including Big Events and Boss Events. Unfortunately, these don’t particularly live up to their name, in that they basically just feel like slightly longer versions of the standard events. Instead of doing something crazy like Forza Horizon’s Showcases, Riders Republic uses these activities as a sort of skill check to confirm you’ve gained enough loot and improved your skill enough to advance to the next bracket of challenges. That’s fine, but not as exciting as I’d hoped from a game that’s constantly shoving its over-the-top qualities in your face.  To help you pass some of Riders Republic’s more challenging undertakings, you’ll unlock new gear as you progress that’ll make the going much easier. A rocket wingsuit with higher stats will make it easier for you to turn and use your rocket boost for longer, while a better snowboard might make you faster in deep snow that would normally slow you down. Getting new gear is essential to be competitive in the most contentious activities and while it's certainly possible to compete with subpar gear, those who have grinded (literally and figuratively) for better gear have an incredible advantage. Therefore, leveling up and gaining new gear becomes a high priority and an addictive part of a sandbox that already gives you dozens of reasons to keep racing. While you’ll be buying most of those upgrades with in-game currecny, you can also spend it on cosmetic stuff to make your character match your particular style – which in my case meant dressing up in the most ridiculous costumes I could find, like an elephant in a suit, a giraffe in a tuxedo, or a dumb-looking, purple unicorn. They really go all-out with some of the options so you can make your rider as ridiculous as you want, and seeing other players in all their freakish glory is definitely part of the fun.  There’s a whole host of compelling competitive multiplayer modes as well, including ranked Free for All races that test your skills against a small group of live players, Arena matches that pit two teams of six against each other as you fight for control of a skate park, and most notably: Mass Races. Free for All and 6v6 Arena matches are a good way to pass the time and play competitively if you grow bored of racing against player ghosts, but they’re also run of the mill modes I’ve seen in other games before. Mass Races are a whole new beast entirely.  Mass Races start with a server-wide announcement calling all players to stop what they’re doing and participate. If you answer the call, you’re thrown into a lengthy racing tournament with 64 players and loads of XP and accolades at stake for those who manage to score a podium finish. As you might expect, racing against 63 other players is utter chaos, but the kind of chaos that works perfectly in Riders Republic, which seems to welcome and thrive in it. The absolute horror show of dozens of people all pushing one another out of the way, flying off cliff edges, and smashing into obstacles at terminal velocity is a sight to behold even if you find yourself putting on a tragic showing. And if you actually manage to earn yourself a podium finish, the payoff and bragging rights are immense.  The only drawback from these ambitious events is that, as you might imagine, technical issues sometimes muck things up. Apparently something about cramming 64 players in the same event all at once isn’t an easy task to accomplish, because about 10% of the time I participated in one it would crash to the main menu – though admittedly it seemed to get better over time as the launch server issues resolved themselves. Even so, crashes and goofy glitches are a pretty regular occurrence in Riders Republic, at least on the Xbox Series X where I played. Once I fell through the world map and met an inglorious demise, and another time I crashed into a tree trunk so hard I got stuck inside of it with no way out. But more often than not encountering a bug just meant crashing to the dashboard with only some inscrutable error code to keep me company. Seeing these sorts of things in a large online game like this isn’t exactly surprising, especially close to launch, but they’re still just frequent enough here that it can start to frustrate. Riders Republic is an ambitious, captivating open-world sports game that had me laughing, sweating, and cheering more the longer I played. It borrows quite a bit from other open-world racing games like it and still has some kinks to work out with the stability of its online service – but it’s astounding just how much Riders Republic manages to successfully pack inside itself, with enough consistently entertaining variety to keep me playing for a very long time. "
185,Disciples: Liberation ,7.0,"A tactical RPG adventure, Disciples: Liberation is a fun outing in a fantasy world that puts you in the shoes of a classic RPG protagonist with special powers, a motley crew of companions, and a bone to pick with fate... then just keeps escalating the stakes further than you'd ever expect them to go. In fact, it punches above its weight class in the quality of its combat and content, but lets itself down with a disorganized mess of extra systems and some very prominent bugs.   Blending a turn-based tactics game with a proper RPG, Disciples: Liberation has you wander through isometric environments as you play through a hefty 80-hour RPG story – I did more than a few sidequests and optional fights, ending up at 92 hours played. It's not an open world, but it's not linear either; each chapter is divided up into a few regions that can be tackled in any order. Within those regions you fight a lot of turn-based battles, and it's good that those are fun and (aside from being a bit slow at times) pretty openly designed because there are a lot of them. It's a suitably sprawling, cosmic story for Nevandaar, a fantasy world that's dark and terrible, but still allows for goodness and redemption. Your character, a gutter-born mercenary named Avyanna, has plenty of dialogue choices: Kind ones denoted by halos, aggressive ones denoted by horns, and snarky ones denoted by Avyanna's own twilight wings symbol. The sidequests have enough diversity, and enough compelling characters, that I couldn't always easily decide who to side with. There's a lot of branching dialogue, most of it pretty good, but some of it's really cheesy and accompanied by equally cheesy voice acting. That's honestly a positive thing, because Disciples: Liberation knows what tone it's going for and sticks to it. Nevandaar is a comfort-food setting; this is a familiar, feel-good, generic fantasy done right. When you settle in for a fight you'll control Avyanna, a few of her named companions, and a set of generic units you've recruited on your travels or produced back home in the ancient magical city of Yllian. There's a lot of variety to the units, from armored infantry to bone golems, possessed berserkers, and feral elf snipers. There are over 50 units, all told, and units level up as you go, so nothing ever becomes truly irrelevant. (Unfortunately, though your companions are a diverse and weird lot, on the battlefield they're just reskins of basic units with higher stats.)  In addition to its front line use, each unit can also be placed in one of your three back line slots, where it contributes a unique power from afar by buffing your units or weakening your enemies. Pro tip: Winter Dryads give your entire army permanent regeneration, which I found invaluable. The combat maps are an ideal size, giving you enough room to maneuver and a sprinkling of terrain to play around. They avoid both the trap of feeling like a tight chessboard and the classic genre mistake of attempting environmental realism at the cost of being tactically interesting. No playstyle feels penalized, nor does any style feel fundamentally overpowered. Both melee-centric and ranged options have their high points, and while mobility is strong, units get bonuses and healing if they choose not to use an action point. Those small bonuses for not acting are brilliant design, allowing defensive strategies to flourish in a genre normally obsessed with aggressive movement. The enemy AI does its best, and does focus fire pretty well, but is very bad at knowing when to time its special abilities and truly terrible at staying put to capitalize on those bonuses. I liked to build my armies out of combos of Undead (who have staying power), Demons (who hit hard), and Elves (to pick off the stragglers). The human Empire units are all obnoxious god-botherers and I couldn't stand their voice shouts after a while, so I mostly didn't use them. One of my favorite army compositions came about mid-game, when my undead Death Knights would inflict the chilled effect on enemies and Elf snipers, who automatically critical on chilled foes, would pick them off. Meanwhile Avyanna – who I'd built into a teleporting battle magician – would wreak havoc with controlling spells in the enemy's back line.  The spells are a particular joy, with an extensive spellbook of magic to collect that varies from situational buffs and fireballs to weird utility spells like walls or clouds of mist. It really nails the feel of that classic fantasy magic-user with a spell for every situation, even if you're playing as one of Avyanna's melee builds. Other systems, however, seem designed almost at random. Resources for building your base and upgrading your troops are poorly balanced, with some critical and others all but useless – I had a stockpile of over 200,000 wood and iron at the end of the campaign but constantly wanted more gold. They also accumulate in real time while the game runs, but can only be picked up in your base, so if you really wanted unlimited resources you could leave Disciples: Liberation running and visit every hour or so. There's other stuff that generally feels irrelevant and only comes up as a frustration, like persistent damage between unrelated combats, or the arbitrary limitation on how many buildings you can place in your settlement. None of that really detracts from the otherwise nice story and combat, though. What does are the interface, which slows down gameplay, and the bugs, which are both frustrating and too numerous to list. The interface itself just has delays built in: It's riddled with submenus and loves to use three clicks for a task when one would do. It's also poorly signposted outside of combat, doing things like showing you a total for a number but not what that number means – it's not fun to reverse-engineer precisely what each point of strength does.  The bugs, on the other hand, are more than mere annoyances. Some were just exploits, like one that let me add infinite units to my army. Others were annoying but survivable, like low-level combats that can't be autoresolved, or skills that seem to do nothing. Other issues consistently cropped up that required me to reload a recent quicksave or quit out and restart. I can't be comprehensive, but I'll give a few examples that required a reboot to fix: A persistent bug made me unable to interact with the world at random. Clicking ""Done"" too quickly after combat locked me on the summary screen. I'm a veteran of weird bugs and probably have more patience for them than most, but these were bad enough that I'd be sure they're fixed before you commit to play.  None of them were apocalyptic, of course. My save worked, and I was ultimately able to finish relatively unimpeded, but it left me with the sour taste that combos, skill bonuses, and other key elements just didn't work. Or, worse, that they didn't work and I had no way to tell they didn't work. Disciples: Liberation struggles against itself. It contains a rich world and high-stakes story that are coupled with fun and varied tactical combat, but this RPG feels destined for cult status, especially among those who didn't know they wanted this particular blend of genres. Despite its epic length, it’s a game that feels like the start of something bigger, and I had enough fun that I'd at least try a sequel. Disciples: Liberation has a lot of interesting ideas going on that could be refined into something great – if its rampant bugs can be smoothed out and its extraneous systems balanced. "
186,Mario Party Superstars ,8.0,"With 23 years of history under its belt, the Mario Party series has certainly had its fair share of highs and lows, with its highs representing some of the most fun I’ve had playing local multiplayer games with friends, and its lows being… well, the near opposite of that. Thankfully, Mario Party Superstars is a celebration of only the best moments this long-running franchise has had. It gathers 100 of the most enjoyable minigames, five excellent boards from the first three Mario Party games, and an amalgamation of some of the best rules, mechanics, and quality-of-life improvements into a single Switch game. It’s still unsurprisingly dull without friends, and not all of the minigames are worthy of the “superstar” label, but on the whole this is quite simply the best Mario Party has been in a very long time. 2018’s Super Mario Party represented a “back to basics” shift for the series, and Mario Party Superstars has taken that idea several steps further by focusing in on the N64 and early GameCube days. There are no motion-controlled minigames, no item capsules, no character-specific custom dice blocks, no buddies to recruit, and of course, no party car. Just four players, each taking turns rolling dice, moving along a virtual game board, playing minigames to earn coins, and using those coins to buy stars. And maybe it's because it has been a long while since we’ve had a Mario Party game without some sort of extra gimmick, but this simplicity is incredibly refreshing, and I certainly didn’t miss having something there to mix up the formula.   It helps that the five boards are some of the best-designed in Mario Party’s history. Yoshi’s Tropical Island is an excellent starter board with an easy-to-understand layout and a fun twist involving the star marker swapping between its two islands – it’s sure to lead to heartbreak and elation in equal measure among your friends. Space Land, meanwhile, is a go-to when I want to play without any game-changing board mechanics and just get that pure virtual board game experience; Peach’s Birthday Cake offers a completely different style of play by keeping the star in one position and sprinkling spots where you can plant coin or star-stealing piranha plants; Woody Woods forces you to think several moves ahead thanks to its constantly changing arrows that send you down different paths; and finally, Horror Land is a personal favorite of mine because of its fun day/night mechanic and a King Boo that can let you steal a star from every other player... if you get a skeleton key, 150 coins, and are able to reach him while it’s night. It’s an insane hail Mary win condition to shoot for, but if you are able to manage it, it’s sure to be a story you and your friends won’t soon forget. Developer NdCube has done a fantastic job of bringing both the looks and sounds of these boards up to modern standards as well. Character models are pretty much identical to how they looked in Super Mario Party three years ago, but the remade boards are immaculately detailed, with Peach’s Birthday Cake being a clear standout thanks to the hyper-realistic and delicious-looking snacks decorating the linear path around the cake. It also can’t be understated that not only have all of the boards and nearly all of the 100 minigames undergone dramatic visual transformations, but they’ve also gained new instrumental arrangements for every song that accompanies them. You can even unlock the songs from the store and listen to both the classic and modern versions of each one in the Data House, which is great because while the N64 songs still hold up, their modernized versions are even better. But while the boards are all impressive, the one bummer is that there are still only five of them. That is a step up over the dismal four that Super Mario Party offered, but still not on par with just about every single other numbered Mario Party game in the past, which have almost always included six. Even just adding one more board from Mario Party 3 would have gone a long way toward making the package feel more robust, and it would have evened out the balance of boards from the three N64 games at the same time. At the heart of any good Mario Party game is its minigames, and fortunately almost none of the 100 that were cherry picked from every numbered entry in the series disappoint. You’ve got your all-time classics like Bumper Balls, Shy Guy Says, Hot Rope Jump, Revers-A-Bomb, and Booksquirm, just to name a few favorites. What makes these games so great is their sheer simplicity, plus a small added twist. Bumper Balls, for instance, is literally just a game about bumping your rivals off a small circular platform while riding a bouncy ball. But the twist is that in order to knock an opponent off, you have to put yourself in a dangerous position by building up momentum and bumping them close to the edge, which puts you in prime position to get bumped off yourself. And then you also have some picks that might not immediately come to mind, yet wind up being great selections because of the variety they bring to the table. Honeycomb Havoc, a game in which you just take turns picking one or two fruits at a time and try not to be the one who’s forced to grab a honeycomb, may not be the most exciting game in the world based on what’s happening on-screen, but the metagame that’s happening between you and your friends as you’re all able to see their loss or victory several moves ahead makes it one of my favorites out of the whole pack. Very few, if any, are complete duds. That said, there are a couple of minigames that are so close to each other that including both of them feels like a waste of space. Leaf Leap and What Goes Up both have you racing upwards by hopping up platforms as fast as you can; Pokey Pummel and Mecha Marathon both have you pressing a button (or buttons) really fast; and Roll Call and Goomba Spotting both have you counting the number of things that appear on screen. All are fun games, and none are completely identical, but when you consider that classic minigames such as Platform Peril, Locked Out, and Running of the Bulb didn’t make the final cut, it’s hard not to feel a bit disappointed at these handful of double-ups. My only other gripe with the minigame selection is that many of the 1v3 minigames are so skewed to favor either the single player or the group of three that it really doesn’t make it much fun for either. In Piranha’s Pursuit, for instance, it doesn’t even feel like you’re part of the minigame when you’re on the team of three, Archer-ival feels actively terrible when you’re not the archer, and Tidal Toss feels nearly impossible to win as a solo player if even one of the team of three is any good. Oh, and there’s the iconic, N64 controller-destroying Tug o’ War, which actually requires an in-game warning to advise you not to use your palm to rotate the control stick in order to avoid damaging either your Joy-Con or your hand. That said, there are a couple of genuinely great 1v3 minigames, like Tackle Takedown, which is a football minigame that has the team of three attempting to tackle the single player who is able to use three bursts of speed to try and juke them out of their boots. But the majority are underwhelming and I always groaned when I saw one was coming up. Mario Party Superstars doesn’t do much that’s completely new for the series, which is completely fine with me considering it brings back so many things that I love and missed from recent Mario Party games. Like for example, stars that cost 20 coins instead of 10, which was a big issue I had with Super Mario Party. It was just far too easy for everyone to afford stars in that game, which really hindered the actual board game strategy and placed too much importance on recruiting buddies to bolster your dice rolls. In addition, Duel Minigames are back and help make the final five turns way more exciting by giving you and your adversaries the opportunity to challenge each other to high-stakes, 1-on-1 minigames with wagered coins up for grabs. And of course, Chance Time is back as well, which introduces all sorts of chaos into the mix..  Bonus stars can also be turned on, off, and even set to the classic style of always going out to the ones who collect the most coins, win the most minigames, and/or land on the most event spaces – but the one truth of Mario Party is that even despite all of those options, luck will always be a factor. Try as you might, you’ll never be able to completely remove its hold over every game, and that’s part of the magic. There will absolutely be times when the person who won the least amount of minigames will end up the overall victor, stealing a win from the person who held the lead for the majority of the match in the final seconds. And yeah, that may feel bad for some people in the moment, but the joy I get from Mario Party Superstars doesn’t come from winning or losing. It comes from the hilarious interactions it pulls out of me and my friends, which it does with a reliability that few other games are able to match. Playing locally in the same room is obviously ideal, but Mario Party Superstars also has a pretty solid suite of online options. The standard Party Mode has both matchmaking with random players as well as private lobbies that let you invite specific friends, and if someone drops out their character will be controlled by a bot until they are able to reconnect – an amusing selection of emote stickers can even let your rivals know exactly how you feel about Boo stealing your hard earned stars. There’s also Mt. Minigames, which offers a variety of modes that let you play minigames a la carte. In the limited amount of testing I was able to do before launch, lag certainly played a noticeable factor in one of my sessions, especially in the more reflex intensive games like Hot Rope Jump and Bill Blasters, but online play was generally fun and serviceable overall. Mario Party Superstars is more than just a collection of excellent boards and minigames from the series’ past: It’s a complete return to form for the Mario Party series. There’s a really great mix of classic and more modern minigames, the overall quality of which is top-notch, even if some of them are a bit redundant. It really could have used one more board, and the balance of the 1v3 minigames isn’t the greatest, but with solid online play acting as the icing on the proverbial Peach’s Birthday Cake, it’s easy to say that this is the best Mario Party has been in at least a decade. "
187,Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy ,8.0,"If you, like me, played the Square Enix-published Marvel’s Avengers and said to yourself “I wish this had just focused on the single-player campaign instead of all this game-as-a-service stuff,” then do I have good news for you: Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, also published by Square Enix, has flown in to save the day. With no microtransactions, no multiplayer, and a relatively meaty story, it’s further proof that linear, single-player campaigns haven’t gone anywhere. Its simple but entertaining combat and fairly straightforward level design won’t revolutionize the genre or anything, but those solid fundamentals and the metric ton of personality slathered on top of them are more than enough to make Guardians of the Galaxy some good old-fashioned fun. Despite being named after the team, you spend the entirety of this roughly 18-hour campaign playing as Peter Quill, AKA Star-Lord. That was a surprising choice to me, but it’s one that ends up working very well for the story that’s being told. The main plot is basically exactly what you’d expect: a cosmic comic book adventure about the Guardians trying to get out of debt, learning to work together, and maybe saving the galaxy along the way – but it’s framed by events that are much more personal to Peter. The result is an engaging story that balances its constant barrage of spectacle and banter with some genuinely heartfelt moments, for both Peter and the rest of the crew: Gamora, Drax, Rocket, and Groot.  While that story is also entirely linear, developer Eidos Montreal’s Deus Ex roots certainly show through with the amount of dialogue choice you are given during it. You’re constantly handed options for how Peter will respond to different conversations, whether those are during important story moments or while walking around chatting with your teammates – there’s rarely a moment where the Guardians aren’t talking, which is welcome when the writing and performances are all as amusing as they are. These dialogue choices are mostly just a fun bit of role playing in an otherwise on-rails story, but some of them can have an unexpected impact. For example, making the right dialogue choices to save a character at one point could have them come back to help you later on. Another time I made a choice that resulted in the next level being a simple stealth section, only to find out after finishing the story that choosing the other option would have instead turned the entire level into a massive firefight. The vast majority of this campaign will likely look very similar for everyone, but these little differences did add a personal touch to my playthrough and got me more interested in trying New Game Plus to see what else could have happened. It’s not just the story that’s played from Peter’s perspective, either: in combat you only have direct control of him and his dual pistols. Instead of swapping into the shoes of the other Guardians, they unlock a total of four abilities each which you can instruct them to use on command. That could be Groot sending out roots to bind up enemies or Gamora dealing a massive amount of damage to a single target. This system gives you a lot of options at any given moment, and the pace at which they are rolled out and the intuitive way they are mapped to your controller makes it a rewardingly manageable task to juggle mid-fight. Peter has a few tricks too, of course. He’ll get four powers of his own, one of which is the ability to activate his jet boots and fly for a short time, and four different types of elemental shots that can do stuff like freeze or burn baddies alongside his regular laser blasts. Combat is a lot of fun thanks to that variety of options, even if it isn’t exactly the deepest or most complicated dance I’ve ever taken part in. Between giving orders to your fellow Guardians, you’ll mostly be holding the left trigger to lock on to an enemy and the right trigger to unleash a fire hose of lasers. A simple active-reload system will reward you with extra damage and keep you paying attention, but for the most part you’re gonna be holding down that right trigger a lot. Even still, combat never stopped being enjoyable for the entire campaign. That’s partially thanks to the enemy design, which is varied enough that you’re pushed to use different elemental attacks to exploit weaknesses or remove shields, as well as bigger enemies that can be staggered by certain abilities. Your teammates all have different roles they fill too – Gamora’s abilities generally have high damage, Drax is more about stagger, Rocket has the best AOE, and Groot can bind targets. It’s good that their abilities feel impactful, too, because apart from them you’ll be doing nearly all of the damage yourself; your teammates’ auto-attacks deal about as much damage as an aggressive massage. Another thing that keeps combat fresh throughout is the banter. Seriously, there is so much voiced dialogue in this game, and the interplay between each team member is both entertaining and informative, in that you see their relationships evolve throughout the story. There were undoubtedly moments where I’d hear the same line yelled a few too many times, but on the whole there’s an impressive variety to all these barks. That meant overly similar fights could still be lent new appeal based on their context or the conversations that take place during them. Dialogue choice is even brought directly into combat with a super move called The Huddle. When activated (which can be done accidentally a little too easily by pressing L1 and R1 at the same time), Peter gathers everyone around to talk about the fight, and then you have to choose a pep talk response based on the things they’ve said to earn a buff. It will also play one of Guardians of the Galaxy’s many licensed ‘80s songs for the duration of the buff, which can either be exciting or hysterical depending on the result. Fighting a giant alien squid boss while “Everybody Have Fun Tonight” by Wang Chung played has got to be one of the most absurdly joyous moments I’ve had in a game all year, while having Bobby McFerrin’s “Don’t Worry, Be Happy” unexpectedly come on during a climactic endgame encounter was a different sort of hilarious. Between the fights and cutscenes you’ll make your way through Guardians of the Galaxy’s varied locations, which range from Nova Corp space ships to gorgeous alien worlds. Like the story itself, these sections are extremely linear paths with an occasional environmental puzzle to solve or optional collectible to find, broken up by fights in more open arenas. And similar to the combat, they stay entertaining the whole way through more thanks to the banter and visual variety rather than being especially deep or engaging on their own. You’ll occasionally need to command your teammates here, too, potentially asking Rocket to hack a terminal or Drax to carry something big and heavy from one spot to another. That can make for some extremely simple but still relatively amusing puzzle solving as you figure out the right way to combine different abilities. Having your team around also adds a little more liveliness to these paths, with them wandering off to look at things on their own or standing around bored while you go search a side route – their presence also helps solve that completionist problem of knowing whether a path is the right way or the “wrong” way full of goodies, since they’ll usually move toward to the next main path on their own and make comments when you head off in search of loot. The collectibles you’ll nab are either crafting currency used to upgrade Peter’s capabilities, cosmetic costumes for different team members to wear (all of which are cooler than a recolor, full of new outfits and throwback references alike), written logs for a bit of story flavor, or special items that unlock new conversations when you are hanging out back on your ship between chapters. It was always rewarding to collect these things, even if the side paths were often just as easy to find and navigate as the main ones. The only real complaint here is that crafting currency is so prevalent that it starts to become a bit tedious to pick up, but that’s probably primarily due to the unfortunate lack of a sprint button. Comics vs Movie Inspirations2014’s movie put them into the public consciousness in a way they were previously nowhere near. And while this game clearly takes inspiration from James Gunn’s excellent adaptation in its main cast and retro music vibes, as a fan of the comics I was happy to see just how comic booky it is too. Without going into spoilers, I was thrilled to see some of the Easter eggs and comic book references that were sprinkled throughout, as well as a few characters who show up in surprisingly significant ways. It’s clear that while Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is trading on some of the recognizable popularity of the movies (the first costume you can find for each team member is based on their 2014 movie outfits), it was also made with a love for the source material in mind. The ultimate result is a game comic book fans will likely find something special in, but those who only know the movies can still quickly pick up and understand – which does feel important, given how wacky and unpredictable the places it goes can be and how many different characters are introduced. More importantly, Cosmo the psychic Russian space dog is finally given the screen time he deserves, and is truly the best boy. Continuing the overall trend, the upgrade system itself is also something that stays satisfying and enjoyable till the very end, even if it can be a little flat at times. Completing fights earns you ability points to unlock new powers, while crafting currency can be spent on any of 15 different perks that are available to unlock right from the start. Having everything on the table right away is nice because it means you get to prioritize the upgrades you want in the order you want them, but it also means there aren’t really any surprises as the campaign progresses. But even without that, I enjoyed that perks felt significant – only some of them are pure stat increases, while most unlock new moves like a dash punch or time slowing for a moment when you dodge at the last second. As a final note, it’s worth mentioning that I did encounter a handful of bugs throughout my playtime on PlayStation 5. Apart from two hard crashes nothing was too dramatic, and Square Enix has said that a number of the issues I encountered will be fixed by release. That said, I did find my progress impeded a couple of times due to an event not triggering correctly or a button prompt breaking, as well as some weird visual issues here and there like the adult Peter model being horrifically squished into childhood Peter’s frame for one scene. All it ever took was a quick checkpoint reload to sort things out, and the auto-save and checkpointing are so forgiving that even the worst issues never left me sour, but it’s not clear how much of that will be there on launch day. Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy nicely balances a goofy, action-filled adventure with some genuinely heartfelt story moments, and the choices you’re given can add some surprising personal twists to your particular playthrough. Its combat and level design are relatively simple if still consistently entertaining, but it’s the relationships and banter between its characters that keep everything fresh as they evolve. It isn’t going to set the world on fire, but Guardians of the Galaxy is still another convincing example of how much fun a linear, no-frills, single-player campaign can be. "
188,The Riftbreaker ,8.0,"There were so many moments while playing The Riftbreaker where I stood at the precipice of annihilation: my resources dwindling, my base relatively undefended as I scrambled to put out fires, and tens of thousands of aggressive aliens marching in my direction. Whether I was managing resources, constructing my base of operations, making upgrade decisions for my mech, or battling hordes of enemies, this RTS/top-down shooter hybrid rarely let me feel at ease – in a good way. Even with several unfortunate bugs and a bland story, surviving by the skin of my teeth through meticulous time management and split-second decision-making made it all worth it. As a frontiersman sent to colonize the uncharted planet of Galatea 37, you run around in a mech and have to establish a base of operations, survive the incredibly hostile local flora and fauna, and open a portal back to Earth before you get eaten by several thousand monsters (or have a panic attack in real life). The characters and story are bland and forgettable and feel like an afterthought that’s mostly used as an excuse to give you increasingly challenging objectives to complete. The writing and voice acting in particular are often laughable, and the main character, Ashley, is about as interesting as a sheet of drywall. But The Riftbreaker succeeds in so many other ways that I found it pretty easy to ignore the awful banter playing in the background.  The Riftbreaker is incredibly ambitious and mixes together the best components of a dozen genres to create something multifaceted and memorable. It’s got base building and tower defense components, survival elements like resource gathering and management, an RPG-like crafting and gear system, and top-down bullet hell combat with loot drops. One moment you’re spending resources to build a power plant to power your ammo factories like in an RTS, and the next moment you’re running around shooting and dodging hundreds of enemy attacks in bullet hell fashion. You also have to find and set up mining operations on resource deposits and build defensive towers to automate some of the responsibilities of protecting your bases from incoming attacks. That hodgepodge of mechanics inexplicably comes together really well. It can certainly get a little overwhelming at times, but the excellently crafted campaign tutorializes you in small bites so you don’t break down and cry (at least not right away). It continually pushes you to learn new mechanics while you’re thrown up against increasingly hostile creatures and environments. For example, one biome is so hot that building any structures is impossible until you master cryo cooling technology, while another has explosive mines hidden underfoot throughout the entire level which makes exploration incredibly dangerous. Each area has its own unique set of problems and resources that can be harvested to improve your gear, defenses, and get you one step closer to opening a rift back to Earth. The desert biome is covered in shifting sands and blazing hot sunlight that can burn your base to the ground, while the volcanic biome obscures your vision with ash clouds and causes massive fireballs to fall from the sky. Some of these areas make it extremely challenging to establish a base, but when you overcome the odds and gain another resource in your toolbelt, it’s incredibly rewarding. Who doesn’t want to feel like the ultimate interplanetary survivalist? Unfortunately, one of these areas is overly ambitious with its enemy design and ends up being relatively broken in practice. The poisonous swamp, which features a deadly plant that slowly takes over the whole map, seems to be too much for even my high-end PC or the current-gen consoles to handle. Visiting it causes tons of crashes and even makes it impossible to save your progress until you complete your objective and teleport back to a different biome. As you explore different biomes and establish bases in each of them, the base-building and resource management becomes exponentially more complex as well. You’ll eventually need to jump between biomes and bases to manage each of their resources, improve their buildings, and confront waves of enemies and environmental catastrophes between each of them. It became so complex by the end of my playthrough that I actually created an Excel spreadsheet and a digital checklist to help me remember which biomes I was drawing resources from and which bases needed improving – that was fun for me, but it does speak to how hard this stuff can be to keep track of in-game. This proliferation of base and resource management can be extremely rewarding, but it’s also intensely stressful. My final hours with the campaign had me standing up and sweating profusely as I watched numbers tick up and down and juggled about 18 different projects with not enough time to accomplish all of them, not to mention the imminent armies approaching my location from multiple fronts. It’s the ultimate test of preparation, time management, and high stakes combat, and it’s absolutely not for the faint of heart. But when I finally emerged victorious, I felt a rush of accomplishment and satisfaction that’s hard to come by. If you want to adjust the difficulty though, The Riftbreaker has tons of options for customizing your experience, including changing the frequency and strength of enemy attacks and other random encounters like weather events, and increasing the abundance of resources available for you to harvest. I prided myself on getting through the campaign leaving these settings as-is, but for those looking for a less stressful experience, it’s pretty awesome that these options were included. And when the base building and resource gathering elements become too much of a headache, there are massive armies of enemies to take on in some excellent bullet hell action that puts your skills and gear to the test. You’ll run into the occasional horde as you explore and settle new areas, but the real challenge finds you when armies amass and lay waste to your defenses in the hopes of destroying your base and putting an end to your attempts at colonizing this hellscape. While you’re able to build defenses, you’ll only ever take direct control of the mech you use for construction, exploration, and combat. Defensive barriers and turrets can deal with smaller groups of enemies attacking your base, but involving yourself directly is absolutely necessary to survive large-scale skirmishes. There’s a wide variety of weapons you can equip your mech suit with, each of them with their own advantages, disadvantages, and resource costs. The flamethrower is great at taking out swarms of weaker enemies at close range, while the railgun does massive damage at long range. Each weapon can also be modified with different effects or bonuses and can be complemented with equippable skills and movement abilities that transform you into a one-woman army. Your mech can lay waste to thousands of enemies in minutes, but you also can’t be everywhere at once, so it’s almost impossible to succeed without the help of defensive towers, which have an equally wide range of options including missile launchers, turrets, mine layers, attack drones, and long range cannons. Each tower has its pros and cons and many play a vital role in keeping your base intact, but not all defenses are especially feasible. For example, the heavy artillery cannon packs a punch but doesn’t come close to being worth the resources needed to keep it powered. Managing the ammo cost, electrical needs, and resource requirements to keep your base well-defended without breaking the bank is a constant balancing act – one that only gets more challenging as time goes on and your appetite for resources climbs to incredible heights. Unfortunately, during the second half of the campaign when your mechs, turrets, and enemy armies are at their highest density, large scale battles left my poor framerate in absolute tatters. These choppy moments aren’t the only issues either, as I encountered a fair amount of bugs and performance problems throughout my 50-hour completionist playthrough. In areas where you approach the maximum build limit, for example, The Riftbreaker begins to crash with relative regularity, causing a frustrating loss of progress. Sometimes towers acted erratically and wasted all my ammo firing at a wall or I wasn’t allowed to place a building without tapping the build button repeatedly. None of these issues are especially experience-ruining (aside from the bugged swamp area I mentioned earlier), but they definitely added annoyance to a difficult campaign that already had me on edge. The Riftbreaker is a fantastic blend of real-time strategy and bullet hell combat that provides an intense challenge and an addictive RPG loop. Its story and characters are aggressively forgettable and its numerous bugs leave it feeling a bit unpolished, but it succeeds at so much during its 50-hour campaign that I’ll remember it for a long time to come… once I recover from the various panic attacks it induced. "
189,The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes ,8.0,"Imagine yourself walking through a tunnel in the underground ruins of the ancient Sumerian Empire. The camera focuses tightly behind your back, adding to that sense of claustrophobia and dread as you clunkily move through the caverns. Suddenly, you hear the distinctive screams of famed High School Musical diva Sharpay Evans from ahead. You know you’re about to be met with a heart-pounding fight against some godforsaken terror that will be sure to test your quick-time event skills.   This is what it’s like to play every game in The Dark Pictures Anthology series, and its latest tale, House of Ashes, is no different. If, like me, you think Until Dawn was one of the most interesting games to have come out of the last generation of consoles and haven’t minded the growing pains Supermassive Games has had to try to anthologize the series, House of Ashes is its best work since Until Dawn in 2015. However, if you’ve become bored with the formula or never liked it in the first place, the latest story probably won’t change your mind. In some ways, that’s the rub of this entire review. Supermassive hasn’t made any, well, massive changes to how its games play or look outside of new difficulty options. The facial capture is still mostly great, though sometimes the characters’ necks look like they’re made out of liquid. Environments look stunning at times while others will remind you that Supermassive is no longer working with a big budget from Sony. Movement is clunky even though we now have full control over the camera during exploration. The bulk of the gameplay in House of Ashes’ six-or-so-hour runtime comes down to making choices and performing different types of QTEs. It’s a formula that Supermassive has used to varying success over its last three Dark Pictures games, but in the right circumstances it still pays off. Without going into spoilers, House of Ashes is very much a step up in storytelling compared to the previous two games in the Dark Pictures series. Both Man of Medan and Little Hope tried to subvert expectations in ways that never felt in the spirit of Until Dawn. House of Ashes swings the story pendulum back and ends with the prospects for an entirely new direction for the series. Following the reveals in Little Hope, I was left fascinated to see what the team would do next. That’s not because I’m continually chasing the excellence that is Until Dawn, but because the direction the franchise might take next is as interesting as The Dark Pictures Anthology has ever been. I don’t want to oversell the story, though. There are still instances of weirdly stilted dialogue and certain aspects of the plot don’t really pay off in meaningful ways. Plus, the whole idea of a game set in the middle of the Iraq War with Marines going into a secret compound to search for Saddam’s biological weapons can be off putting knowing what we now know about how that particular conflict turned out. There’s also some potential for character arcs to feel either unearned or heavily cliched. I mean, you can probably guess what might happen when a young Marine and an Iraqi soldier are forced to work together. It can, of course, change depending on your choices, but it never feels like Supermassive is breaking new ground with its character work. If anything, the characters continue to be the weakest part of The Dark Pictures Anthology, though the participants in House of Ashes are a small step up from what we’ve seen in Man of Medan and Little Hope, with Salim being the most notable. Little Hope tells a mostly one-note story with underdeveloped characters, and even a fun co-op mode can’t inject enough life to fix that. There weren’t enough meaningful consequences to the choices I made to inspire further digging into its box of tricks, which made additional playthroughs tough going, and the more generous amount of time you have to react to quick-time events deprived me of any gory deaths. A gorgeous setting and some genuinely frantic monster sequences save it from being a complete disaster, but this still feels like a step backward from the heights of interactive horror stories. Hopefully, the next entry in the Dark Pictures Anthology will have interesting characters with much more to say and do, as Little Hope’s predecessors have proven Supermassive can deliver. What House of Ashes does do well is the same thing that made Until Dawn so special. Supermassive excels at building tension throughout its best moments, and it subtly uses the environment to help do that. For example, House of Ashes mostly takes place in an underground ruin. Think of films like The Descent for a solid reference point. In both that movie and this game, the creators use tight camera shots as the characters are sneaking through tunnels to add an extra sense of claustrophobia, which increases the scare factor. You never know what’s going to be around that next bend, and Supermassive is superb at mixing in both jump scares and other ways to keep you on your toes. And for fans of the gory deaths that are seen so often in horror games, the new difficulty options make the QTEs even harder. You can, of course, turn things down to easy mode for a fun night with friends. On that note, we should mention that co-op is the best way to play these games. Whether in the same room via Movie Night or online, this is a fright that you’ll want to share. If you want to take things up a notch and really see some blood and guts, the tougher difficulty options will oblige. I mostly played on the middle difficulty (Challenging) and didn’t have too much trouble, but bumping things up to Lethal tested me – as it should. On top of everything else good about House of Ashes is a central mystery that’s a return to form for Supermassive. After two back-to-back middling endings with Man of Medan and Little Hope, this one nailed it for me. That isn’t to say it’s groundbreaking or guaranteed to blow your socks off, but it’s more in line with what many expected to see coming out of Until Dawn. Plus, again, the implications it has for the future of the franchise are beyond intriguing. Without spoiling much, it’s safe to say that I am as hyped as I’ve been for the series since Supermassive first announced it was making more horror games. If it can deliver on what it’s set up, we might be on the verge of The Dark Pictures Anthology becoming a force in horror games. In many respects, you know exactly what you’re getting with The Dark Pictures Anthology: House of Ashes. It’s a QTE-filled horrorfest that is often stretching against the limitations of its budget. The script could use some polish and the characters could be a little more outside the box. However, the claustrophobic scares work effectively, and the central mystery of House of Ashes signifies a return to what fans loved about Until Dawn. It gives us a tantalizing look at what could be coming in the future. "
190,Back 4 Blood ,8.0,"Amid a sea of seemingly endless looter-shooters, Back 4 Blood bucks a lot of trends in favor of something old-fashioned. After spending 25 hours with this four-player cooperative first-person shooter, I came to love its glorious white-knuckle tone, clever card-based progression, and varied, fist-pump-worthy campaign. An awkward difficulty curve and a stale versus mode prevent Back 4 Blood from moving into a full-blown sprint, but it still provides an exciting mix of new and old ideas as you mow down shambling legions of the undead. Set in a post-apocalyptic world where popping zombies (called “Ridden” here) in the head is as ordinary as brushing your teeth, Back 4 Blood follows a community of survivors trying not to get their jugulars torn out before breakfast. This isn't a plot you'll get deeply invested in, as it's just a series of thinly-veiled excuses to shoot zombies with friends, but that's all the justification the four-act campaign needs. Despite dire circumstances, it's actually a pretty lighthearted romp, with seven playable ""Cleaner"" characters frequently cracking jokes amid impending doom. My favorite is Karlee, a punk-rocker who's prone to blaming teammates for standing in the way of her bullets should friendly fire ensue. By the time my friends and I were held up in a bar, mowing down hundreds of zombies as Black Betty by Spiderbait blasted over the jukebox, I was fully on-board with Back 4 Blood's silly, upbeat mood.  That surprisingly pleasant attitude pervades combat in Back 4 Blood as well. All too often, I found myself grinning over utterly absurd sights, like Sleeper Ridden sitting comfortably in meaty wall-mounted cocoons suddenly springing to life then pinning a teammate to the floor. Or hucking frag grenades into a crowd of living dead only to have the ensuing sinew-showers drench friends. Laughs aside, the gunplay has quite a satisfying kick too. The M249 light machine gun packs enough of a wallop at high firing rates that I nearly always carried one, particularly if I found any damage-enhancing attachments laying around. Whether you're into high-powered magnums or lighting fast assault rifles, every weapon feels excellent in Back 4 Blood. Even just a bat with a nail or two pounded through it! It's a shame then that losing sight of your target is incredibly easy during wild, up-close brawls. Too often, I'd accidentally tag friends with stray bullets while attempting to differentiate them from the sea of bodies rushing us like an unholy mosh pit because combat readability is sorely lacking. Your character can often come out of fights covered in blood and guts looking like a zombie, and that's decidedly not great when the entire goal is to kill anything even remotely resembling one. What's more egregious is several Ridden types look nearly identical despite behaving differently from one another. Exploders and Retches are both bloated masses with broad shoulders, yet the former run towards you and, well, explodes, while the latter vomits acid from a distance. They have a few distinct features that you can recognize to tell them apart, but it's stuff like small spikes on their arms that are easy to miss in the thick of a fight – and a wrong guess on your part can have significant consequences. Back 4 Blood's shockingly in-depth card system is the right sort of thing to get lost in, thankfully. Deck-building might sound hilariously ill-fitting for a game about rattling off thousands of rounds at walking corpses, but it’s maybe my favorite addition to this familiar formula. Before missions, you can equip several cards that modify a Cleaner's stats and abilities. There's a starter deck, and you'll find more scattered throughout environments or by plugging points earned in missions into the light progression treadmill called supply lines. Since Karlee was my main and her unique Cleaner card buffs item-use speed, I wanted to keep up a fast pace on her feet and in her holster as well. So I built a deck with Superior Cardio, which increases stamina regen like nobody's business, and Power Swap, adding a hefty 20% damage boon to weapons after swapping between primary and secondary sidearms right before a clip runs dry. Stopping for anything became a fleeting memory with these cards, as I could bolt to and fro while often one-tapping through the undead hordes. Compared to what others have come up with, my deck was relatively simple. A friend cleverly combined the effects of several cards so that he would gain loads of health back after swinging away at Ridden en masse. Even ridiculous decks like that don't feel overpowered, though, as corruption cards crop up mid-mission to counterbalance your boons with challenging modifiers. For example, just when we thought our builds were too strong, one corruption card spiced things up by adding an Ogre, a 20-foot tall lumbering mountain of flesh and bone, to the mission. Cards add brilliant RPG-like random elements while not veering off entirely into levels and skill trees. It's essential to sift through every card you come across while out scavenging in levels, too, because attempting Back 4 Blood's more challenging difficulties are a waste without them. There are three difficulties available from the get-go: recruit, veteran, and nightmare. My group initially chose recruit to find our footing, and we knew it was too easy before long. So we dialed it up to veteran, and everything went to hell. We got maybe 20 feet out from a mission's starting point before being overrun by the stronger Ridden types. An enormous, gangly Tall Boy crushed one friend in its grip while a sneaky Stalker dragged another away, then finally a Retch projectile vomited everywhere — as if to humiliate us with its corrosive bile. I'm not sure Back 4 Blood earned the right to feast on our indignity, though, as that sort of ridiculous scenario is more a byproduct of my team being hideously ill-equipped for veteran difficulty. At least, when we'd only completed a handful of missions, anyway. I love a good challenge, so long as everything is fair. Marching into Back 4 Blood's veteran or nightmare difficulties straight away is downright masochistic, however, especially as debuffs pile up when corruption cards enter the mix with more intensity than they do on recruit. I have a suspicion that Turtle Rock Studios wants everyone to play through recruit first, similar to how Diablo 2: Resurrected handles its progression curve. But if that's the case, I have no idea why the others are selectable from the start. Worse yet, there's a bizarre roguelike element to each run, so finishing an act means your party will need to complete sessions within a limited number of continues or else you’ll have to redo an entire chapter, which feels out of place in a game like this. Once we'd finished the campaign on recruit with loads of cards to beef up our Cleaners, veteran difficulty was much more manageable, but a difficulty that lands somewhere between them would go a long way toward alleviating these issues. If nothing else, getting trounced on veteran or nightmare gives you a decent excuse to replay Back 4 Blood's wonderfully diverse chapters, each of which contains several unique missions. From desolate, rural towns in the middle of nowhere to entire cityscapes engulfed in mounds of rotten fleshy overgrowth — nowhere is safe from this world's collapse. The campaign isn't just a leisurely stroll from saferoom to saferoom either, as your objectives will shift about quite a bit depending on the circumstances. One mission called T-5 requires you to scavenge about a crusty old mansion for key items as swarms of undead try to break in. The pace at which you have to find every trinket’s randomized location is breakneck, yet creepy taxidermy busts practically beg you to admire the fine layer of dust they've collected. I regularly got distracted by the haunting beauty of it all, much to my teammate's distress. That continuous practice of spicing things up is why I keep returning to Back 4 Blood. Not all of Back 4 Blood's attempts at breaking the mold work out, though, as is the case with its 4v4 who-can-outlive-the-other Swarm mode. Sure, having one team of survivors take on another that's all Ridden as a battle royale-like circle shrinks the arena sounds cool, but in truth, it's pretty easy to cheese if you're the Ridden. Crowd control is vital to success in Swarm, and the four-armed Hocker just so happens to excel at affixing survivors to the ground with sticky spears it can lob from a distance. Whenever my friends and I used two Hockers and a pair of Tall Boys, we’d decimate the team of survivors. Even as they gain access to better guns as the match goes on, we only need to pin them as the Hocker then have one of our Tall Boys move in and blitz whoever's stuck. Meanwhile, the same happens to us when we're on the survivor side of the equation. That sort of massive imbalance makes Swarm uninteresting at best and frustrating at worst.  Between its stellar card augmentations, excellent campaign, and jovial tone that creeps into every facet of its design, Back 4 Blood puts some exciting new spins on a familiar genre. Its flippant difficulty spikes and unbalanced versus mode prove not every experiment works out, but its co-op zombie-fighting manages to forge its own identity. Back 4 Blood confidently marches to the beat of its tune rather than lifelessly shamble after distant memories. "
191,Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Hinokami Chronicles ,7.0,"Fighting games and story modes can be like oil and water. They’re a tricky thing to mix properly, probably because it’s hard to tell a story well when your main method of conversation is two characters punching each other in the face. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles is no exception to this problem, with a single-player mode that never quite nails the balance between telling its excellent story and making that story fun to actually play. But fortunately, its arena-based combat is fast, satisfying, and strikes a nice balance between approachability and depth, especially in multiplayer. The Hinokami Chronicles follows the same plot as the manga and anime it’s adapted from, starting from the beginning and then working its way up through the end of the Mugen Train arc. If you’re unfamiliar with Demon Slayer, it follows Tanjiro and Nezuko Kamado after demons murder their family and transform Nezuko into a demon herself, chronicling the pair’s quest for revenge and search for a way to make Nezuko human again. Much of this story is retold through immaculately rendered in-game cutscenes, all of which are fully voiced in both English and Japanese by the anime series’ cast.  You don’t need to be familiar with Demon Slayer to become invested in the characters, their arcs, and the overall plot either. A lot of that speaks to the quality of the script, which alternates between silly, heartfelt, and serious with natural ease, but equal praise must be lavished on the voice cast – particularly Zach Aguilar and Aleks Le, who play Tanjiro and his cowardly friend, Zenitsu, respectively, and stand out even in a cast that delivers outstanding performances all around. The cutscenes can run a little long between fights, but it’s a small price to pay when the original story is being retold as well as it is here. But when The Hinokami Chronicles makes you walk around and explore the Demon Slayer world between these familiar scenes, it becomes kind of a drag. That’s a shame, for two reasons: first, because Demon Slayer’s story is entertaining enough without these extra sections; and second, because playing the roughly nine to 12-hour story mode is pretty much the only reasonable way to unlock every playable character for the Versus mode, which is probably where you’ll want to spend most of your time anyway. You can also unlock them by grinding out Versus mode fights, but doing so would take so long that it wouldn’t be worth it, which isn’t great if you’re just here for the multiplayer. The Hinokami Chronicles is divided into eight chapters. After an introductory series of cutscenes, each chapter will have you guide Tanjiro and friends across a mostly linear series of maps as you complete quests by talking to other characters, search out clues that will lead you to where demons might be hiding, and solve small puzzles. As you explore, you’ll also be able to collect Memory Fragments, which are short movies that combine voiceovers and stills from the anime series, and Kimetsu Points, which can be used to unlock rewards like characters, alternate costumes, quotes, art, and songs from the soundtrack. It sounds fine on paper, but in reality, it’s mostly a slog. Characters move through the world far too slowly with no way to run faster, which is particularly frustrating if you’ve backtracked to avoid a dead-end or retrieve a collectible. Sometimes, you are forced to walk even slower so characters can deliver dialogue along the way, meaning these sections take even longer. Worse, some maps feature no interactions at all, making me wonder why the dialogue within them wasn’t just a cutscene as I waited for my character to tediously jog to the next area. It might have been an interesting idea if the interactions or movement were entertaining themselves. Instead it’s mostly a slow, dull process that only requires you to push the stick in a direction and listen to some pretty unnecessary dialogue. In one particularly egregious example, Tanjiro has to convince the people of a small city to go inside before nightfall to keep them away from a demon that has been abducting young girls. Each interaction is exactly the same, forcing you to monotonously repeat it four times. There can be the occasional flash of something clever – one sequence involves finding your way out of a house that is constantly shifting around you, while a later chapter offers up some fun mini-games – but walking around a map is mostly something I tolerated rather than enjoyed. Swordfighting Ways Developer CyberConnect2 seems to know this too, peppering areas with plenty of fights against a handful of nameless demons to teach you the ropes of combat before throwing you into the fun stuff: the boss fights. It’s here that the story mode is at its strongest, and the fighting is where The Hinokami Chronicles truly shines as a whole. It’s an arena fighter, pitting teams of two against one another in a small, 3D environment, though the story mode often features one-on-one bouts, many of which are extravagant boss fights with moves regular characters could never have. The combat controls are simple and intuitive. All normal attacks are mapped to one button and all special moves to another. You can vary things up by pressing the stick in a direction while pressing one of those buttons to either perform different specials or one of three unique combos: one that launches, one that keeps foes on the ground, and one that knocks them down. Each fighter can also throw, dash, perform an Ultimate Art, use heavy attacks, and activate two special power ups: Boost and Surge. Boost powers up your attacks and adds an extra combo route, while Surge gives your character unlimited meter for a short time. These techniques strike a good balance of offering plenty of interesting options for counter-play without making The Hinokami Chronicles overwhelming to pick up at the start. In two-on-two battles, your other teammates can also provide assists courtesy of one of their own special moves at the cost of half of their assist gauge, or use it all to rescue their partner from getting beaten down mid-combo. Swapping between team members is also possible (provided you have some assist gauge left), though health is shared between characters so you never run the risk of losing your partner, no matter how dire things look. It’s an easy combat system to learn, but there is depth for those who want it in the form of parrying attacks and chaining combos, special moves, and assists together depending on your team composition and how much special meter you have. The Hinokami Chronicles’ real strength is in its movement, and learning to move around the arena and put yourself in a good position is key to winning. Landing attacks just feels good too, with even basic combos packing a satisfying punch – and everything looks cool as well, especially the Ultimate Arts and special moves, which are beautifully animated and have that signature Cyberconnect2 touch. Combat is incredibly satisfying, but does have a few small issues here and there. The first real flaw comes in the form of heavy attacks: since these are performed by flicking the stick forward and pressing the attack button, you’ll often get a regular attack when you want a heavy. Precision is key in a fighting game, and this is a noticeable frustration in a fighter that’s otherwise extremely precise. Another issue stems from the combo gauge, which tracks how long a fighter can maintain a combo. The gauge exists to limit the infinite combos that plagued CyberConnect2’s Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm games, and while it’s a good balance addition, it doesn’t make exceptions for moves with multiple hits. When the gauge is depleted, a combo stops immediately, even if a character would otherwise be hit or is in the middle of move with multiple strikes. That means the time limit feels more arbitrary for some characters than others. Mistime your gauge, and a character can sometimes drop out of a combo mid-attack, recover, and punish the person still recovering from a move that would normally hit before they can do anything about it. Like the heavy attack input, it’s not a huge flaw, but certainly a noticeable little irritation. In the story mode, fights are high-intensity affairs, often pitting Tanjiro, Nezuko, Zenitsu, and friends against demons with unique moves and power-ups. The fights work best when the demons you’re up against play like the characters you have access to, allowing the best parts of this fighting engine to come through. Larger, more unique bosses are still entertaining, but their moves cover so much of the arena that you’re often playing defense and waiting for an opening for a couple quick strikes. However, both types of bosses suffer from a couple shared issues as well.  For starters, bosses can knock you back at will, even when you’ve got them in a combo, negating any reward you might have obtained from playing correctly. Even more problematic is their version of Boost mode, which makes their moves substantially more powerful and also essentially makes them immune to being staggered when hit, meaning they can break through your offense at any time. That, combined with the fact that these boosted attacks will often damage you even when you’re guarding, means you spend most of that portion of the fight running away until Boost wears off and they’re stunned, allowing you a chance to deal damage. This wouldn’t be as annoying if it didn’t happen several times per fight, as it’s not particularly interesting and takes away from the ebb and flow of the positioning battle that makes The Hinokami Chronicles compelling. That said, many of the boss battles, especially the later ones, are legitimately excellent and require a good understanding and execution of the mechanics available. Even the quick-time events, known as Final Clashes, that end the fights manage to avoid overstaying their welcome and actually add to the feeling of satisfaction that comes with finishing off a particularly intense encounter. Best of all, you can replay the encounters without doing the boring map sections that accompany them once you’ve beaten them. Once the story mode is through, there’s not a lot of singe-player replay value unless you’d like to go collect Memory Fragments or Kimetsu you missed, try out each chapter’s Special Mission, or up your rank on certain fights. There’s a practice mode to hone your skills and work on your combos, as well as a training mode that presents special challenges as if you’re being trained by the cast. Of course, there’s also the Rewards mode with goodies to unlock, and it’s easy to spend time in the Archive looking at costumes or listening to music tracks. Slaying Demons, Online and Offenough, but just 12 unique characters would be a small roster for any fighter, and it feels doubly so in a game built around tag battles. I enjoyed playing all the characters – my personal favorites were Nezuko and Rengoku because of their rushdown style – but the roster feels restrictive as is. CyberConnect2 has promised to add six more characters as free DLC starting with Akaza and Rui, who, like the rest of the demons in story mode not named Nezuko, are strangely absent at launch. This should help, but without knowing how the characters play or when they’re coming out, it’s hard to know how much. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Hinokami Chronicles is a wonderful retelling of the already excellent Demon Slayer anime, even if its inconsistent story mode isn’t as much fun to play as its cutscenes are to watch. Still, it’s an impressive arena fighter where it counts, with combat that deftly balances depth and accessibility, but a disappointingly small roster also holds its multiplayer back from being truly great at launch. "
192,Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl ,7.0,"The idea of a Super Smash Bros.-style platform fighter that brings together some of Nickelodeon’s most beloved cartoons across multiple generations is one that just makes so much sense, and it’s kind of a wonder that it’s taken this long for something like Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl to come around. But despite Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl’s clear inspirations, developer Ludosity has made a notable effort to differentiate its mechanics and the overall flow of combat from Smash Bros., resulting in a fighter that is way faster than any Smash game has been since Melee in 2001. This puts All-Star Brawl in a great spot as an alternative to Smash Ultimate that’s available on practically every platform – but its subpar use of its wealth of source material, along with a general lack of polish and a few irksome mechanics, does mean it’s not a recommendation that comes without a few significant caveats. The first thing that comes across while playing All-Star Brawl is that this feels like a game made on a pretty tight budget. The character models and backgrounds lack detail, the original themes made for each level are extremely generic, there’s just one barebones single-player arcade mode, a barely worth mentioning Sports Mode, and zero meaningful unlockables or progression rewards outside of some images and songs in a jukebox. But perhaps the most damning thing of all is that, despite being a game all about celebrating Nickelodeon’s finest, there’s very little Nickelodeon charm that comes through. There’s no voice acting, no remixes of any themes from the many cartoons featured, and while the stages are littered with fun Easter eggs for fans to discover, it all just feels kind of soulless.  It’s an impressive come-from-behind victory, then, that All-Star Brawl is still really fun to actually play. It follows the same basic formula as other platform fighters by removing life bars in favor of damage percentages: the more you get hit, the higher your damage percentage and the further you’ll go flying from every hit until you’re KO’d by an opponent knocking you off the stage (unless you turn on critical KOs). This means two key things: you can potentially be killed after taking hardly any damage, or you could survive even after taking an enormous amount of punishment. It’s a really exciting style of action where it feels like you always have a chance to make a miraculous comeback even if you’re down multiple lives. This style of fighting game really comes alive in a party environment with up to three friends, and All-Star Brawl is no different. It’s super easy to pick up, be given minimal instructions on how to play, and have a good time regardless of your experience level. That said, the developers are clearly huge Smash fans themselves, because they’ve designed the deeper mechanics behind that approachable coat of paint with more hardcore fans of those games in mind. Where All-Star Brawl sets itself apart is primarily in its movement. It’s exceptionally fast-paced, facilitated by high run speeds, speedy recoveries on most attacks, and its unique air dash that functions as a recovery option, a wavedash, and a fastfall all in one. The air dash allows you to dash left and right for a quick, substantial boost of horizontal momentum that you can still perform actions out of, or in any direction downwards for an even larger burst of speed. The downside is that it’s specifically an air dash, and not an air dodge, which means that there’s no invulnerability frames during it.  It’s a trade-off worth making though. I love the extra mobility given to every character thanks to this unique take on the traditional air-dodge mechanic. It allows for unpredictable approaches, greatly aids characters who would otherwise struggle immensely with their recoveries when trying to get back to the stage after a big hit, and works as a great tool to play mind games with your opponent and keep them guessing at what you might do. There are also a number of smaller mechanical differences that help further establish All-Star Brawl’s identity in the platform fighter genre. There’s no rolling or spot dodging, so the only way to avoid taking damage when you are hit is by blocking or negating the attack with one of your own; instead of Smash attacks, there are strong attacks which can be performed in the air; and every character has a throw that allows them to pick their opponent up and move them around before tossing them (unless the opponent is able to mash out of their grasp). While I appreciate most of the ways All-Star Brawl tries to be different, I’m not a fan of all of its mechanics. I especially don’t like that all characters have basically the same throw, nor do I really like the throw mechanics in general. It looks janky, it’s too easy to mash out of at low percentages, and feels like a cheap KO at high percentages. But worst of all, not giving unique animations for each character on their throws feels like a missed opportunity to add some more personality to each movelist, while also further diversifying their playstyles. . They may not look quite good enough to really flood my brain with nostalgia chemicals, but All-Star Brawl’s cast of characters is largely great from a design point of view. It’s a healthy mix of some obvious “must haves” and interesting oddballs that might not immediately spring to mind when you think of iconic Nicktoons, but end up being pretty inspired choices – like Nigel Thornberry, whose eccentric moveset involves him mimicking attacks and poses of various animals to hilarious effect. There are definitely some glaring omissions, like any characters from Rocko’s Modern Life, Angry Beavers, or the Fairly Oddparents just to name a few, but all-in-all, this is a fairly admirable starting roster of 20 characters that primarily covers a decent spread of Nicktoons from the ‘90s to the early 2000s. There are classics like Rugrats and Hey Arnold, megahits from the 2000s like Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra, and then The Loud House as the sole representative of modern Nicktoons.  Each fighter plays just like you’d expect they would. My personal favorite, Avatar’s Aang, has weak overall power, but can chain his light airbending attacks together at pretty much any percentage and becomes an absolute combo machine. Reptar plays the role of the Bowser-like beast with slow attacks that can send you packing with just one or two strong attacks close to the edge. Meanwhile, Lucy Loud changes into either a vampire or ghost form whenever she connects with her bite attack, which alters the properties of some of her moves. I do wish that not every character had a spike move on their aerial light-down attack since – it’s such a powerful finisher that giving it to characters who are already super strong feels like overkill – and some characters have moves that are eyebrow-raisingly close to what’s found in Smash Bros. – but aside from those issues everybody on the roster feels quite distinct from one another. What doesn’t feel distinct is when multiple people pick the same character. For whatever reason, there are no alternate colors or costumes for any of the characters. If you’re playing with four Reptars, the only thing that distinguishes you from your opponents is the small icon above each one, which can make it hard to figure who you are at an immediate glance, especially in larger stages. Each character comes with their own stage, a total of 20 in all, which is a pretty decent number of arenas... except when you consider that the number of stages you’ll actually want to visit is probably much lower than that. Whether you’re playing competitively or casually, most of the gimmicky stages just aren’t fun to fight on. You’re often going up against the stage more than you’re going up against your friends as you try to keep up with rapidly moving tiny platforms in the Space Madness stage or avoid roller coaster cars on the two solid bits of land in the Glove World stage, just to name two frustrating examples. These types of levels aren’t anything new, but they don’t have the kind of visual spectacle that makes that sort of sacrifice worth it. The handful of stages that are worth playing on are the ones you’ve probably come to expect. Relatively flat and straightforward stand-ins for Smash’s iconic Final Destination, Battlefield, Smashville, and so on. That said, while most of the gimmick levels are a nightmare, there are a few that can be pretty fun given the right circumstances. The Showdown at Teeter Totter Gulch level from Rugrats is a personal favorite of mine because its teetering central platform isn’t too intrusive and provides a nice change of pace. And even though it’s a little too hard to get kills on because of its enormous size, the Powdered Toast Trouble level is packed with fun interactables and Ren and Stimpy Easter eggs. Perhaps the secret weapon of Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is its online play with rollback netcode, which in my experience has been relatively smooth for the most part. There certainly have been bad matches, especially on certain levels like the Rooftop Rumble stage, which I’ve had numerous issues with while playing online, but the vast majority of my online matches have been without any issues. It’s definitely no Guilty Gear Strive in terms of the quality of its netcode, but at the very least, it’s good enough where I can comfortably say that this is the one area where All-Star Brawl has a clear advantage over Smash Ultimate. Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is a very respectable platform fighter that serves as a fun, though far less polished and less fully featured alternative to its competition. The characters and stages feel soulless without the iconic Nickelodeon voice acting and music of its source shows, but All-Star Brawl lands its hits where it matters the most: in the fights themselves. If you can look past its underwhelming audio and visuals to see the surprisingly nuanced fighter just beneath the fog of nostalgia, then you’ll find some real treasure in this pineapple under the sea. "
193,Metroid Dread ,9.0,"Metroid Dread first turned up in 2005 – it even got a name drop in a terminal in Metroid Prime 3: Corruption. In many ways, the re-announced, presumably reworked Metroid Dread of 2021 feels like that 2D-ish Metroid game we should have gotten 16 years ago, following two masterpiece Metroid games, Zero Mission and Prime. It’s not often we get to say this about a game that emerges from more than a decade of development purgatory, but the wait has been worth it: The epic delay allows Metroid Dread to use the Switch’s power to greatly improve on what could have been accomplished on previous Nintendo systems, and makes the supposed conclusion to Metroid’s mainline story something of a grand finale. Everything works in handheld form, but you really have to dock the system to get the full 2D-style Metroid experience on your TV that we’ve been missing in the three decades since Super Metroid on the Super Nintendo (that said, Zero Mission looks pretty cool emulated on the Virtual Console). Playing on a big, HD screen reveals sprawling alien scenes in diorama-like backgrounds, lit by the dynamic glow of Samus’s arsenal and projectiles. Also thanks to the Switch, the action never seems to drop a frame. That’s important, since combat is lightning fast, and just keeps getting faster with each powerup. Everything seems to speed up as you move through Metroid Dread. Upgrades add to your movement, and reduce backtracking time with boosts, dashes, and jumps, all while you’re making incredibly short work of once-powerful enemies with your new arsenal.  One issue I had with the last Metroid, the 3DS remake of Samus Returns, was the cramped controls of the 3DS hindering the action – especially the new, twitchy combat. That combat makes a return in Dread, but here on the Switch it’s much more comfortable – and more fun. The counter system from Samus Returns, which requires careful timing to react to enemies visibly foreshadowing their attacks, is just one of many moves including dashes, feints, dodges, and timed-charge attacks that make up your bag of tricks, and that can take up a lot of buttons. It’s not bad on the Switch in handheld mode, but Dread only really shines with the Pro Controller. If I had to beat a boss – and these are some of the toughest bosses in Metroid history – I docked every time. Those boss fights range from the traditional big, drooling monsters with patterns and weak points to learn, to almost Smash Bros.-esque encounters with enemies that mimic your move set. The variation is welcome, especially in contrast to the way Samus Returns pitted you against the same boss bugs many times over. I don’t want to give anything away, but these are some of the best boss fights I’ve ever played in an action platformer: Without exception,they seemed impossible at first, but post-victory, I felt like they’d made me a better player. One repeated encounter you’ll have is with the creepy, crawling EMMI bots which you might have seen a lot of in previews of Metroid Dread. These are less what you’d think of as boss fights and more akin to stealth missions (and sometimes a manic race to the finish line if you are spotted). The EMMI pursuing you transform entire regions of the map into one-hit-kill zones (you do have a small window of escape, but it’s vanishingly small) – which makes another new-to-Metroid feature of Dread, auto saving, which triggers just outside the EMMI zones, extremely welcome.   While it’s been marketed as a remake of Metroid II: The Return of Samus for Game Boy, Metroid: Samus Returns is more of a much-needed reboot of the 2D Metroid games we know and love. It’s a safe, modern take on Super Metroid, one of the greatest games of all time. Aside from some repetitive boss fights and hand-cramping controls, it’s nearly everything I could ask for as a fan of old-school Metroids. One aspect of boss fights that I’m not too keen on, however, is the use of counters as quick-time events: Timed button-pressing sequences that you must complete to transition to another stage of a boss fight. It is often impossible to discern whether you even need to be shooting a boss while you await its next counter-able move. I would like to be able to use my 200-some stock of missiles to just destroy a boss the old-fashioned way; what am I collecting all those missile tanks for if I can’t even barrage a boss with overwhelming firepower once in a while? Speaking of collectibles, the many ways missile tanks and other upgrades are hidden is exquisite. There are some truly inscrutable puzzles that left me pondering between play sessions, and going for a 100% run is a great way to experience the intricate way the world is put together. The Speed Booster and Shinespark moves are especially conducive to mind-bending puzzles and require incredibly precise, split-second platforming that’s both fun to figure out and gratifying to (finally) pull off. By employing some classic Metroid moves, like bomb jumping, I was even able to “sequence break” and get some upgrades I couldn’t even use yet, which made me feel like a badass. That kind of flexibility and freedom made the world feel that much more welcoming to exploration and experimentation. If you aren’t a completionist, you can choose to shoot through Metroid Dread in a shorter burst. According to the game log, I spent 11 hours on my first run, reaching 82% completion – but that figure clearly excludes pause screens, which you might spend a lot of time on because the map itself has been overhauled and tracks mysterious things you can’t interact with, items you saw but didn’t obtain, and rooms with a secret you didn’t even spot. I pored over the map screen frequently to discover secrets, but also to discover my next step. I suspect that many will turn to a strategy guide for the latter, since Metroid Dread does very little to direct you to your next objective. As a general opponent of hand-holdy waypoints, I like this change – especially in a game that emphasizes probing every block. In addition to the tricked-out map, you also get a scanning tool that’s balanced just the right way to give you clues to secret paths but doesn’t lead you around by the armcannon. The map, and really the world itself, morphs a few times, too – especially in the later game. I won’t spoil any late-game tricks for you, but while they aren’t quite to the scale of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night’s upside-down castle, the new routes you’ll have to work out and the enemy obstacles you’ll encounter are all quite cool. I’m not sure I needed another length of game added onto the end of this, anyway. As my fellow editor Kat Bailey put it, Samus Returns overstayed its welcome – and it was stretched a bit thin by the end, with repetitive bosses and a map that took a while to make your way across. Dread learns from that mistake and gets the pacing right, ramping up the speed at which you get new tools and access new map areas to something of a fever pitch. It’s up to you to pick a point, take a breath, and backtrack if you’d like. Otherwise, you can power on through to the end. (You will absolutely want to bring as many ammo and life upgrades with you as possible, though – again, these bosses are no joke!). In my review of the Nintendo Switch OLED, I was able to test out Metroid Dread. While playing in handheld, I quickly noticed how much Metroid Dread benefits from the Switch's OLED display. Some sections have darker blacks and subtly gray areas, particularly in the sections where an EMMI is patrolling, and the OLED's ability to display absolute black made those areas eerier and creepier. Even Samus Aran herself, whose bright blue power suit stands in stark contrast to the environment around her, regardless of which area she is roaming around. Check out my further impressions in the full Nintendo Switch OLED Model review. - Taylor Lylesbit of ballyhoo around this being the final chapter of at least one Metroid storyline, and whatever you are thinking that means, it’s crazier. Unlike the Prime series and other spinoffs, this is a “mainline” Metroid game – the fifth since 1986’s Metroid – and though the story is sparse (probably for the best after some hammy diversions like Metroid: Other M), it supposedly wraps up here. Despite the twistier elements of the plot, there is one series-peak moment when Samus does something completely unexpected. It’s subtle, and it’s lovely, and I can’t wait for fans to experience it. That subtlety extends to much of the story, as well. There isn’t a lot to it: A bounty hunter, a bunch of innocent but very hungry aliens, and of course a new reason for how you lost all your great weapons and equipment. I found it refreshing that, where games like Other M went way too far building out the world of Metroid and ended up with some pretty awkward results, Dread shuts that world out and focuses. Instead, Dread is grounded in a story about Samus and the vanished birdlike alien race that raised her, the Chozo. It’s an approach that reminds me of series greats, Metroid Prime and Zero Mission. And those Chozo? They sure built a lot of subterranean tunnels for a race equipped with wings, but we can let that slide.  Metroid Dread gets so much right after so many years that I almost feel resentful that we didn’t get this game and a few sequels in some steady cadence starting in 2005. But instead, I’m incredibly happy to play a Metroid that is back at the top of its game. Even though it’s the latest in a decades old series, Dread has just enough clever innovation to balance its familiarity. The universally recognizable mix of tough puzzles, tougher boss fights, ever-evolving exploration options, and intricate level design that recent games like Hollow Knight and Ori get so right has an origin point: It’s Metroid. I love those games, but the Metroid team, a mix of old and new developers now, have shown that they know how to do it best. "
194,Nintendo Switch – OLED Model ,8.0,"In 2021, Nintendo announced the latest iteration of its hybrid gaming console in the form of the $350 Nintendo Switch OLED model. Despite all of the things this hardware refresh does right, most notably the slightly bigger and much better-looking display, the unchanged internal specs and lack of significant improvements to the dock have left me ambivalent after spending a week using it. The excellent new screen certainly makes this the best Switch for anyone who doesn’t already have one, but the relatively slim list of upgrades for those who do also has me wondering why some of these design revisions weren’t rolled out with the 2019 model. The Switch OLED features a larger 7-inch 720p OLED display, making it slightly bigger than the base Switch’s 6.2-inch screen, but thanks to the smaller bezels (the black frame around the screen) it’s nearly the same physical dimensions as the previous Switch – it’s 242mm long, as compared to the original’s 239mm. The Switch OLED also beefs up the storage, doubling it from the original Switch’s tiny 32GB to… a still pretty small 64GB. Of course, we have the same option to expand it with a MicroSD card (the slot for which has been shifted slightly).  The crown jewel of the Switch OLED is, of course, the quality of the display itself. The OLED display is a significant change to the original Switch and vastly improves playing in handheld mode. As disappointed as I was to hear that Nintendo decided to keep a 720p resolution in handheld mode for this revision, it’s still a major step up in not only how good games look, but where they look good. Specifically, the Switch OLED makes it a lot easier to play games in direct sunlight. No longer must we seek out dark corners to play in, or shield the screen while playing in the backseat of a car or on a plane! While not as bright as, say, the display on my new iPhone 13 Pro when at maximum brightness, I can now more comfortably bring my Switch outside with me and play a few hours while kicking back on my hammock. The display hits a sweet spot that makes it more of an incentive to take it with me wherever I go, making the Switch feel more mobile than ever and living up to the “play anywhere” promise. As someone who mostly plays my launch model Switch docked, this made a massive difference for me right away. After playing just a couple of games I felt spoiled by the additional screen real estate, and it was harder to go back to my 2017 Switch. On top of everything else, the slightly bigger display also makes the on-screen text a little bigger; that may not be a massive difference to most people, but when doing a side-by-side comparison with the original Switch it is clear as day. em>To summarize the key differences between LCD and OLED, each has its own methods to light up and display an image on the screen. LCD displays typically use one backlight to light up an entire panel whereas OLEDs have self-lit pixels and display light on a pixel-by-pixel basis, which allows for deeper blacks and more vivid colors.Additionally, while OLED displays are known for having greater issues with burn-in, a Nintendo spokesperson says features like auto-brightness and auto-sleep should prevent burn-in from happening on the Switch OLED. Naturally, I haven’t been able to test this over the course of a week. But, considering auto-brightness and auto-sleep are options that can be turned off, burn-in could still pose a threat – but you really have to go out of your way to make it happen. Hori Split Pad Pro – some controller grips, third-party docks/mounts, and cases may not fit; I would not recommend forcing the OLED into any of these things to make it work. Spending roughly a week with the Switch OLED, primarily in handheld mode, I could easily tell that the screen made games a lot more vibrant. At peak brightness, the OLED really pulls me in on the action and, more importantly, it just makes games look more colorful. Tracks like Rainbow Road in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe look a lot brighter and more vivid. By comparison, when I went back to playing on my original Switch the same course looked colorful but dim, even when adjusting the brightness and disabling auto-brightness. I also found that colorful, cartoony games like New Pokemon Snap and WarioWare: Get it Together! really shine on the new screen. Even the darker and grimmer Metroid Dread benefits a lot from the OLED display. There are some sections that have darker blacks and subtly gray areas, particularly in the sections where an EMMI is patrolling, and the OLED’s ability to display absolute black made those areas eerier and creepier. And then there’s Samus Aran herself, whose white and bright blue power suit stands in stark contrast to the environment around her. The Nintendo Switch OLED also adds a new feature not found in the original Switch or Switch Lite, called Console-Screen Colors. It’s enabled by default but is toggleable in the settings menu and has two options: the default Vivid and a reduced Standard option. While I thought at first the Standard mode would revert the console’s brightness and colors to look more like the original Switch, that is not the case. Instead, Console-Screen Colors serve one purpose: to increase the level of brightness and color saturation, particularly in lighter colors. So games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons look noticeably brighter, with bright-colored items and clothes given a lot more color, and they feel like they must be truer to the color scheme its creators intended it to display. However, Console-Screen Colors does bring up one issue I have with the OLED model: the feature only changes how colors are displayed on the Switch OLED itself – meaning it won’t impact docked mode, even if you’re playing on an OLED TV. Still, this almost-hidden feature really does make the OLED the best way to experience handheld Switch games to date. Unfortunately, there’s a reason that Console-Screen Colors is a togglable setting rather than something you’d leave on all of the time. All the additional vibrancy it brings can occasionally go too far, causing some games to have oversaturated colors. I found this to be an issue in games that were already pushing saturation to the limits, like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. I saw a few instances where some oversaturation of color made slight differences to the saturation of backgrounds, particularly in the opening title screen. It’s not to the point of obviousness, but it was definitely noticeable when flicking the  Console-Screen Colors option on and off. It can be annoyingly inconsistent, even within the same game. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, for instance, looks great in some areas with vivid colors enabled, but when I was roaming the open world, the color of the cel-shaded grass felt a bit oversaturated. It is a case-by-case thing for sure, but it can be distracting. All that said, I could not help but feel – at least in the case of the OLED display – some real “this should have been here since 2017” energy. The fact that the PlayStation Vita, a handheld released back in 2012, had an OLED display (albeit a smaller one than the Switch OLED) makes me wonder if an OLED display was up for consideration in the original Switch. It definitely would’ve been more expensive, but Nintendo doesn’t seem to have a problem with charging $350 in 2021. (Granted, that’s easier for it to have the confidence to do now that the Switch is its best-selling console since the Wii). OLED display aside, the latest Switch refresh makes some other smaller, yet appreciated improvements to the overall design. The speakers on the Switch OLED are slightly bigger, but to be honest I did not find the slightly clearer and louder sound quality to be that big of a difference for the most part – not something I’d have noticed if I weren’t doing side-by-side testing. Battery life remains mostly the same, as noted on Nintendo’s website. Though some games I tested, like Breath of the Wild, did last a few minutes longer than the 5.5 hours Nintendo estimated, other games, like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, were closer to the 5-hour mark (an improvement over the 2019 Switch, which gave out at 4 hours and 50 minutes). Again, from what I could find, the battery life improvements are modest and mostly just a few extra minutes. The Switch OLED has the same 3.5mm audio jack on the right side of the console, as well as the long-awaited Bluetooth audio feature (which is now enabled on all Switch models through a software update). I was able to seamlessly connect my Apple AirPods, though your Bluetooth performance and mileage may vary depending on the wireless headphones or earbuds you are using. Outside of the display, my favorite improvement to the Switch OLED is easily the new kickstand. Taking some cues from Microsoft’s Surface Pro line, the Switch OLED kickstand is a lot firmer and more flexible, offering more angles at which you can set the Switch up without risking it falling flat if you bump the table. Its increased width means any worries or anxiety over breaking the kickstand are gone in the OLED model, which makes it a lot easier to play multiplayer games like Super Mario Party in tabletop mode. Most of the improvements for the Switch OLED are on the handheld side of things, but there are some minor changes for those who prefer playing the Switch on a TV, including a revised dock. Aside from coming in a new white color, the dock has curved corners and the inside includes a glossy black design. The new dock includes a bit more space than the original, which may help compensate for the issues the original docking station had with scratching the Switch’s display when placing it inside, though there is a tradeoff: the Switch now wobbles a bit while docked. Not to the point where you will risk disconnecting it from the TV, but I noticed it when comparing it to my old Switch dock, which has no wobble at all. The revised Switch dock still has the two USB ports on the left side, but the back is a little different from the original in that it includes a detachable backplate instead of a back door with a hinge, and the backplate also includes a bigger outline for cables than the old dock. I found the material on the revised dock’s backplate to feel a little cheaper than the original, and I miss the hinge that attaches the backplate to the Switch dock. A year and a half after release, the Nintendo Switch has delivered on its initial promise of allowing us to play high-quality games both at home and on the go – it just hasn’t gone much further than that. Being able to play its absurdly impressive (and still rapidly growing) library of both first and third-party games seamlessly on a TV and a handheld device is just as great as I hoped it would be, even if some design flaws have cropped up since we first got our hands on it. The Switch doesn’t have all the entertainment and social features people have come to expect from a home console, but that doesn’t stop it from being a disruptively good gaming machine with some of the best exclusives of this generation. The revised dock also ditches the third USB port in favor of a LAN port, a welcome addition through which you can connect directly to a Wi-Fi extender or router via an Ethernet cable. I have a pretty solid internet connection and speeds, but that connection is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain that connects to the internet. For the original Switch dock, the only way to do that out of the box (without buying an adapter) was over Wi-Fi, which is generally not going to be nearly as fast as a wired connection. Games like Cuphead and Sonic Mania would take about 40-50 minutes to download on my Wi-Fi connection, but over LAN they take roughly 15-30 minutes. The LAN port also vastly improves stability in games that have online functionality. I’ve always had lag when playing online for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Mario Tennis Aces, and Splatoon 2 on my launch Switch, but I noticed no lagging or internet issues on my end when connected to an Ethernet port. (Note that Nintendo will sell the new docking station separately at a later date, so you do not need to spend $350 for a whole new Switch if that’s all you want, though you’d be better off buying the $30 adapter if you’re not annoyed by a dongle hanging off your dock). A year and a half after release, the Nintendo Switch has delivered on its initial promise of allowing us to play high-quality games both at home and on the go – it just hasn’t gone much further than that. Being able to play its absurdly impressive (and still rapidly growing) library of both first and third-party games seamlessly on a TV and a handheld device is just as great as I hoped it would be, even if some design flaws have cropped up since we first got our hands on it.

195,Far Cry 6 ,8.0,"The Far Cry series has long experienced something of an identity crisis. Is it a hard–boiled story of survival, or a goofy physics playground with pet bears and flamethrowers? The answer has usually been “a bit of both,” and that’s not necessarily a bad thing.  Far Cry 6 doesn’t buck that trend – the flamethrower definitely hasn’t gone anywhere – but the latest installment does manage to smooth over a lot of the bumps that have cropped up in the past few games, and in doing so becomes the best the series has been in years – but it also misses some steps, especially with its updated inventory system, and that creates some new problems along the way. Far Cry 6 once again sees you trapped in a huge open world controlled by a charismatic madman, this time on the fictional island nation of Yara. Even after this many games, the job of turning all the red dots on your map into blue ones is still a good time, whether by sneakily silencing every enemy guard or by going the less subtle route of throwing bullets and Molotovs at them until no one is left.  Primarily modeled after Cuba, Yara is ruled by fascistic dictator Anton Castillo, who’s expertly portrayed by notorious TV bad guy Giancarlo Esposito; with this performance, he has handily claimed the top spot on my list of favorite Far Cry villains (with apologies to Mr. Mando). His regime would be too preposterously evil to believe at times, if not for its real-world South and Central American inspirations. But it’s his unwavering devotion to his vision of a “perfect” Yara, along with Esposito’s natural gravitas and the stoic charm he projects to his still-loyal subjects, that make him a great foil to the chaotic diaspora of revolutionaries you’re working to unite as you attempt to topple the regime of El Presidente and his lieutenants. Castillo’s underlings aren’t necessarily anyone to write home about, running the gamut from “psychotic navy Admiral” to “psychotic air force Captain” to “psychotic propaganda director.” They’re all played well, but even the more interesting inclusions of a North American pharma tycoon and Yara’s own friendly neighborhood mad scientist feel like familiar entries in the Big Book of Video Game Bad Guys – especially when compared to Esposito’s Castillo. Every one of Esposito’s scenes is captivating, particularly during the exchanges with his son, Diego. He’s a boy trying to reconcile his understanding that the impact of our actions on others is more important than our own intentions with his father’s vehement belief that noble ends justify despicable means, which creates some powerful (if one-sided) tension throughout. It’s a shame that the very end of the story doesn’t provide a clearer resolution for the many conflicts introduced throughout – though Castillo remains a memorable antagonist until the bitter end. While a lot of the success of the character belongs to Esposito for his work on the role, the cinematic animation team deserves a commendation for translating the minute details in his performance onto digital character models. The story overall can be a fairly predictable affair, with all of the sudden-but-inevitable betrayals and tragic-yet-motivational character deaths you’d expect from a big-budget popcorn flick. It does manage to balance its more serious main story with the more ridiculous aspects of its freeform gunplay better than any Far Cry game in recent memory – though I think it also leans a little too heavily on the trope of “grizzled-yet-goofy” veteran fighters. There are certainly some great character moments throughout, and the decision to return Far Cry to third-person cutscenes is a good one, especially if you choose the femme version of main character, Dani Rojas. That’s thanks to an earnest performance by actress Nisa Gunduz, who in no way feels like she’s playing second fiddle to the big–name celebrity on the box art. The rest of the voice cast is solid, too – particularly Glow’s Shakira Barrera, who’s beleaguered rancher–turned–rebel is easily one of the best supporting characters you’ll run into. Similarly, relative newcomer Xavier Lopez shines in some powerful moments, and it’s great to see trans characters not only included but played by a trans actor – though nuance can still be a bit tricky for Far Cry. FC6 clearly wants to be a more socially responsible game than its predecessors and – to its credit – it does make an effort to tackle some social issues, even if the script might stumble a bit over the reality of some of those moments. But it still feels trapped between presenting an authentic representation of Latin American culture and a gonzo’d-up version designed to please mainstream Western audiences. The world itself seems like a gorgeous rendition of South and Central American life, but the script sometimes relies so heavily on specific colloquialisms that it feels like it borders on caricature. Or, more egregiously, there’s the cockfighting minigame that’s basically Mortal Kombat with chickens. I know it’s technically legal in Cuba but... yeesh. While previous Far Cry games have mostly pitted us against pirates, mercenaries, and cultists (not to mention mutants, evil cavemen, and cyber commandos), Far Cry 6 makes its bad guys a properly organized and equipped army. It’s a little straight–laced, given the series’ origins, but it also provides more diverse and engaging encounters. Enemy Captains can call in reinforcements or airstrikes to flush you out of your sniper’s nest, while Medics will revive wounded comrades and engineers will mount auto-turrets. They’re a good addition to the usual roster of “shotgun guy, molotov guy, and heavy guy” that gives you interesting reasons to prioritize your targets beyond simply “who might see or shoot at me next.” On top of that, Far Cry 6 is the strongest the series has ever been when it comes to turning fleets of trucks, helicopters, and tanks into fiery metal scrap. While it’s still super satisfying to clear a checkpoint without raising an alarm or even an eyebrow (this is how I spent most of my playthrough), there’s a very special brand of joy that comes from speeding down a highway trashing a convoy with mounted machine guns while blasting Ricky Martin, and the sizeable arsenal FC6 puts at your disposal makes going loud an especially appealing option this time around. Taking a cue from 2019’s Far Cry: New Dawn, FC6 provides not just the usual truckload of real-world weapons but also a selection of what it calls “Resolver Weapons” and Rides, named for the Cuban practice of “making do with what you have.” It’s an idea that arose after the US embargos took effect in the ‘60s. These ramshackle killamajigs range from a portable EMP cannon, which is great for disabling tanks and helicopters, to my personal favorite: a minigun made out of an old motorcycle engine that can be upgraded to fire incendiary rounds. There are also a handful of similarly jury–rigged vehicles to find around the world. They lacked the firepower and armor plating of your more personalized vehicles, but their multifunction designs made them invaluable to getting around Yara’s massive map – plus I just can’t say no to an electric buggy that hot-swaps into a paraglider. As someone who loves the Far Cry formula and will take my fix wherever I can get it, revisiting Far Cry 5’s slightly reworked open-world map in New Dawn proves there’s still quite a bit of joy to be found in clearing outposts and generating as much chaos as possible, in single-player or co-op. I could’ve done without the silly story and disappointing final boss, but Expeditions are a thrilling new mode, and the story missions are exciting more often than not. New Dawn is an enjoyable diversion while we wait for Far Cry’s next big thing.
Rounding out your arsenal are Supremos, which are effectively Ultimate Abilities duct-taped to a backpack along with a bunch of depleted uranium. Each one has a unique function, be it a rocket barrage to clear out enemy strongholds or a salvo of poison bombs that can cause hallucinations and turn soldiers against each other. I primarily swapped between the rocket pack and one that gave me basically ghost vision – yeah, there’s some supernatural stuff to find when you wander off the main story path – and take out enemies through walls, though others, like the self-reviving Medic pack were equally helpful when I chose not to have one of the Amigo animal companions at my side. Changing up your arsenal is a lot more important this time around, too. Enemies now have unique resistances and vulnerabilities to certain types of ammo, and that – combined with the health bars that appear over their heads like in New Dawn – had me concerned early on that every firefight would devolve into a frustrating ammo sink against a bunch of unkillable bullet sponges. Thankfully, you can turn the health bars off in the options menu (the HUD is fully customizable, down to the color of roads on your map), and it was good to see that FC6 includes a welcome suite of accessibility options. It took a few hours to amass enough weapons to feel “ready for anything,” but the careful balancing of Far Cry 6’s increasing power level versus my own meant taking someone down rarely felt tedious. And while that’s a welcome new idea, it’s the moments when you have to switch from stealth to action on the fly where the biggest change to the Far Cry formula simultaneously shines and... stumbles hard. In Far Cry 6, abilities that this series had previously unlocked in RPG-style skill trees are now attached to armor and mods for your weapons and gear. It’s satisfying to use the wide variety of gadgets to create playstyle loadouts for each Supremo, and the number of unlockable gadgets provides a lot of variety – from classics like proximity mines and C4 to new introductions like perception grenades, which automatically tag enemies for you (huge time saver!). Moving perks and bonuses over to mods and clothing really leans into FC6’s emphasis on crafting and customization, even if some of the armor bonuses feel like they should be permanently unlockable. It makes sense to tie things like quieter movement to a pair of soft-soled shoes or improved fire resistance to a Nomex jacket, but why do I need to be wearing a specific hat to perform a takedown out of stealth? This would work really well if there were a similarly easy–to–swap loadout system for armor and weapons, but without that (or even just the ability to Favorite an item) the constant need to shuffle my inventory was, at the best of times, a brief dip into a clunky UI and at worst (and much more often) a tedious interruption to what is otherwise really enjoyable action. This became even more of an issue when adding a friend into the mix, since the pause function of the single-player game is removed when playing in co-op mode. That said, teaming up to stealthily take out military installations or complete one of the Operations together was good fun. Similar to New Dawn’s Expeditions, these one-off missions (which can also be played solo) take you to locations beyond the bounds of the open-world map (though they still allegedly take place somewhere in Yara?). There were only two available during the review period – one to the ruins of a town recently devastated by a huge mudslide, another to a robot dinosaur theme park that in no way infringes on the copyright of any Steven Spielberg movies. They’re a fun side activity and a good way to test your collaborative skills with a friend, but for my money, Far Cry 6 is at the top of its game when wreaking havoc across the countryside – whether you’re with a buddy or on your own. If just causing random chaos isn’t your bag, there are plenty of side quests and off-the-beaten-path activities, and almost all of the ones I dug into were either fun diversions from the weighty task of liberating an entire country or deepened my relationship and understanding of the supporting cast – and sometimes both. Given just how much of Far Cry 6 there is, my map was still probably 20% unexplored by the time I rolled credits, and I’m looking forward to diving back in and seeing what I missed – though I hope there aren’t many more with a heavy focus on platforming. Platforming has never necessarily been a cornerstone of the Far Cry series, but I also don’t remember the jumping and climbing mechanics being as finicky as they are in Six. It’s a relatively minor gripe, but while some games are very clear that “you can only climb on the blue ledges,” the indicators in Far Cry 6 are much less consistent. Some climbable objects are clearly marked in orange. Others in blue. You can only climb these vines but you can also mantle onto ledges that have other vines on them, but not every ledge, because some are just a hair too high and others aren’t high enough. To be clear, most of the time I’m able to clamber over boxes or onto roofs just fine, but when I’m trying to avoid getting machine-gunned to death and get stuck slamming my face into a concrete wall, it’s more than a little frustrating. This was probably the most irritating technical issue I ran into playing on an Xbox Series X, though it wasn’t the only one. Apart from a couple of freezes or crashes during load screens over 30 hours, though, most of the bugs I ran into were very minor. Some framerate slowdown during cutscenes or driving through dense foliage here, a couple of unbalanced or dropped audio tracks there, and the very rare need to reload a checkpoint.  Far Cry 6 is some of the most fun I’ve had with this series in nearly a decade. Its cast delivers strong performances across an enjoyable story, even if it’s also a fairly predictable one that doesn’t always land the bigger swings it tries to take. And despite some faltering new inventory mechanics and a handful of bizarre design choices, its creative weaponry means taking down an outpost, ransacking a convoy, or even just taking a ride with a buddy has never felt better.

196,Alan Wake Remastered ,7.0,"Like a flashlight flickering to life from a freshly inserted set of Energizers, Alan Wake Remastered takes the 11-year-old survival horror shooter and presents it in its most radiant form. Yet while the details in its moody environments are now far easier to make out, its gameplay shortcomings are presented in equally stark relief. Alan Wake Remastered’s twisted brand of psychological torture by torchlight still makes for a supremely tense trip through the woods, but as a shooter it’s stuck in the past compared to more modern games – including developer Remedy’s own Control. If you missed it the first time around, Alan Wake Remastered’s story remains a novel one in every sense of the word. When crime fiction author Wake’s wife goes missing in a small town, the only clues to her whereabouts are the loose excerpts from a book he has no memory of writing. The details described in this breadcrumb trail of manuscript pages manifest themselves into the subsequent events, making for a consistently enthralling journey down a descent into madness in which Wake is armed only with a small arsenal of guns and a battery-powered torch to keep the darkness-cloaked townsfolk at bay. It’s a pulpy, Stephen King-style thriller viewed through the dreamlike lens of David Lynch, and it’s every bit as gripping and surreal as that pairing of influences would suggest.  Remedy has built a world that, despite being a fantastical realm of twisting shadows and realities, is solidly anchored in authenticity. Outstanding environmental design and some brilliant visuals and sound make Bright Falls and its mountainous surroundings look and feel alive. Though the camera can cause issues and the supernatural story that's more interested in asking questions than answering them, it's a tough game to put down once you've started. Remedy's done a great job of mixing elements of written work, television, and videogames to create an experience full of scares, laughs, and thrills that's just as fun to play as it is to watch. Make no mistake, this rerelease is very much a remaster as opposed to a full remake; its graphics may have been overhauled to an appreciable extent but gameplay remains unchanged. It looks pinsharp at 4K and runs at a fluid 60 frames per second on the PlayStation 5, and the slightly shoddy cutscenes from the 2010 original have been given a welcome new lick of paint. Even so, Alan Wake Remastered remains a fair way behind the big-budget visual standards that have become the norm in 2021. Perhaps to best illustrate this, after my first 10 minutes with the PS5 version I had to pause it and double check that I hadn’t downloaded the PS4 version by accident. Still, the gloomy setting of Bright Falls has certainly never looked better, with jagged edges straightened out by anti-aliasing, textures more clearly defined right down to the woolen weave of Wake’s coat, and the neon signs in the local diner popping with a more realistically vibrant glow. Unfortunately, the character animations seemingly haven’t received similar attention in the remastering process, making their stiff movements seem as wooden as the western pines that surround the small town. Otherwise, Alan Wake Remastered plays in the exact same way as the original did, and in some respects I admire the streamlined nature of the survival-horror shooting at its core. Ammo and batteries can certainly be scarce at times but for the most part there’s little need for any complicated inventory juggling, and there aren’t any crafting systems to fuss with or skill trees to flesh out like so many shooters released in recent years. Aside perhaps from the collectible coffee thermoses, nothing you pick up feels superfluous; every flare is precious for buying a bit of breathing room when you’re surrounded, and each hunting rifle bullet is best kept in your back pocket for when one of the more brutish Bright Falls locals attacks. Of course, the downside to such simplicity is that there’s not a great deal of depth. By the story’s midpoint you’ve had your hands on all the weapons you’re ever going to get access to, and each shadowy enemy ambush starts to feel largely indistinguishable from the next, causing Alan Wake Remastered’s second half to become increasingly mired in repetition. Remedy would later go on to, well, remedy this issue with the excellent Control in 2019, which evolved its combat over the course of its duration via a transforming gun and expanding set of superpowers, but that just makes Alan Wake’s one-note action seem even more antiquated in retrospect. While I wouldn’t expect a huge shake up to the combat system in what is otherwise a purely superficial remaster, playing Alan Wake Remastered did make me wish for at least some light improvements to its interface. An on-screen stamina indicator for Wake’s sprint ability would have been a plus, since judging how far you can run without him fatiguing feels like total guesswork. Similarly, you’re not really given much indication of incoming attacks from offscreen. While the dodge button is extremely effective anytime you see an axe spinning towards you, I found myself routinely copping a shovel to the back of the head with no time to anticipate and react to the blow. Minor HUD changes such as these would have gone a long way towards mitigating the occasional frustration I felt this time around. The episodic structure of Alan Wake was inspired by the popularity of binge-watching DVD box sets at the time of its development, and I know that for a fact since its writer and creative director Sam Lake mentions it in the brand-new commentary track included with this Remastered edition. Eleven years on from Alan Wake’s original release, comparatively fewer people binge DVDs in favour of consuming television via digital streaming services, and as a result, a majority of people aren’t really provided with the means to listen to commentary tracks anymore. But I, for one, miss the candid insight into the creative process a good commentary track can provide, and so I very much enjoyed Lake’s takes on Alan Wake with the benefit of hindsight and the experience of a couple more games under his team’s belt. Plus it just feels so appropriate to listen to the writer of a game monologue about a game about a perpetually monologuing writer. Two bonus episodes that were originally paid DLC, The Signal and The Writer, are also included with Alan Wake Remastered, and they come complete with the same level of visual polish. Having skipped over them the first time around I was delighted to discover how they expand on the transforming-words-into-objects mechanic that is only briefly used at the end of the main campaign; however, having replayed the entire story and its two epilogue episodes I still have no real idea what the meaning is behind it all. That artistic vision may remain intentionally ambiguous, but at least it’s no longer compromised, since the much-maligned product placement from the original version is now gone. Packets of Energizer batteries have been substituted by a generic off-brand replacement, and obtrusive Verizon commercials no longer play on in-game televisions – making for possibly the first time in history that Verizon dropping out in a remote part of America can actually be considered a good thing.  Outside of the new commentary track, the one bit of truly new content in this remaster is the QR codes that are hidden throughout the environment. They’re arguably just as conspicuous as the now-absent in-game ads, but at least they serve a useful purpose for fans: scanning them with your real-world phone takes you to some intriguing new videos that I won’t spoil here. Playing Alan Wake Remastered is a bit like taking an old horror hardcover off the bookshelf and wrapping it in a glossy dust jacket; it looks brand new on the surface, but the experience of actually thumbing through it remains the same and some of the edges of of its well-loved pages are starting to look a bit dog-eared. It’s therefore fairly inessential for existing Alan Wake fans, but its consistently menacing atmosphere and clever plot tricks still make for a distinctive survival-horror experience for newcomers – even if the advanced action of Remedy’s most recent game has left poor Alan in its wake. "
197,Astria Ascending ,6.0,"There is always something exciting about playing a brand new JRPG that isn’t from one of the popular franchises we already know and love, mostly to see how it differentiates itself from the pack. But while Astria Ascending’s turn-based combat is excellent, its mediocre story and weak quest design drag it down. It has plenty of amusing things going for it, but those shortcomings keep it from becoming the breakout JRPG it had the potential to be. Astria Ascending puts a side-scrolling twist on a more traditional, turn-based RPG shell. You’ll explore its world of Orchanon as a 2D platformer, entering separate rooms, collecting treasures, and encountering enemies as you travel across the screen. But while its presentation is novel, its story setup is something we’ve seen several times before: you play as Ulan, the leader of the 333rd company of Demi-Gods trying to stop an uncompelling chaotic threat that wants to remove harmony from the world.  Each of your party members has their own bigger motivation too, but in general, the story is just so cliche. Astria Ascending’s world has a unique look and its races are freshly designed, but their differences are only skin deep. Because of this, the main cast suffers from bland dialogue and a lack of personality, making them uninteresting to spend dozens of hours with. And like so many other JRPG stories, their struggle is against yet another syndicate of generic villains that want to destroy the world for some weak, unconvincing reason. That isn’t to say that this story structure never works, because it does have entertaining or heartfelt moments here and there. Many party members have family tied into the events in ways that could be compelling, but with how vague a lot of the plot points are left, those potential hooks were never actually able to grab my interest. Unsurprisingly, completing your quest will mean venturing into a handful of puzzle-filled dungeons. Some of these require you to take advantage of basic elemental powers to solve them, like using wind to move boxes to their correct position. But most aren’t that engaging due to their simplicity. Dungeons are usually structured the same too: each has a boss known as an Astrae that you can summon in battle once you’ve defeated it, followed by another boss at the end, leaving them a little too predictable to make your way through. The repetition is shaken up a bit relatively deep into the story by a section where you shoot enemies in the sky like a side scrolling shooter, but it’s too little too late. You only ever see this twist between specific locations in the latter half of the story, and by that point you’ll already have progressed so far that its introduction feels random and disjointed. As you explore Orchanon, you will also find plenty of side quests, but these are similarly straightforward and uninspired, doing little to make the world feel fleshed out. You’ll often be asked to defeat a certain number of enemies or find the quest giver a specific item, and little else. While none of them are very interesting, additional guild missions that task you with killing special enemies for money, experience, and skill points can be. Every enemy type has distinct abilities so fighting these minibosses adds even more variety to the creatures that you face, which is especially welcome when combat is the shining star here. Astria Ascending really stands out in its battles and its art style. Every zone is drop dead gorgeous, especially in dungeons. Since it’s presented as a 2D platformer outside of fights, the world of Orchanon feels as if it was created in a story book – each of its characters drawn with tender love and care, and they especially shine in combat. Whether it be an attack, spell, buff, or status effect, everything is animated immaculately and with purpose. The combat itself is some of the best I’ve seen in a traditional turn-based JRPG. This is due to the excellent Focus mechanic, which makes the party gain Focus Points when striking an enemy’s weakness. Focus can stack up, allowing you to deal an abundance of damage once it maxes out. But while you’re collecting Focus, enemies can hit your weaknesses and do the exact same thing, raising the stakes the longer a fight goes on. You’ll also have to be careful since using the wrong attack on an enemy will make you lose Focus, adding an extra layer of tension to each fight. Mix that exciting system with the art and animations and it truly makes combat an impressive package. Almost every encounter feels like a challenge that is satisfying to conquer too. An intuitive job system provides a wide variety of abilities to use, and planning your team’s powers is where Astria Ascending’s true puzzles lie. Members of your party begin with a starting job but will gain three more throughout the story, which provides them with a myriad of different skills to mix and match based on your personal preference and the weaknesses of the enemies you are facing. Unfortunately, Astria Ascending also comes with some horrendous difficulty spikes. This means you’ll occasionally need to spend a significant amount of time grinding to get past tough enemies. There is at least a difficulty option that can be lowered if you’re not willing to deal with these annoying spikes – but on the normal difficulty, it’s not uncommon to spend multiple hours leveling just to get past one specific fight only to have to do it again for a different one not too far down the road. Astria Ascending’s incredible battle and job systems are perfectly complemented by its gorgeous art and animations, but the rest of this JRPG doesn’t shine nearly as bright. It’s hindered significantly by a bland story, one-note cast, and brutal difficulty spikes throughout. That brings down its otherwise rewarding combat, and makes the journey feel like a chore rather than the exciting start of something new it could have been. "
198,Diablo 2: Resurrected Review in Progress,7.0,"em>Activision Blizzard is currently facing serious ongoing allegations of harassment and mistreatment of marginalized workers. To learn more, please visit our timeline as well as our in-depth report on the subject. Nothing more than a coat of fresh paint over the old masterpiece, Diablo 2: Resurrected is a curious piece of video game restoration. After a hundred hours smashing demons, I've kicked Diablo to the curb a couple times and I'm thoroughly reacquainted with the good and the bad that the most revered game in Blizzard’s action RPG series has to offer. As someone who played more than my fair share of Diablo 2 between 2000 and 2007, Resurrected absolutely scratches an itch for the golden age of this genre. At the same time, it's blatantly a game from an era where the demands on our time were very different than what we’ve seen in the past decade. In the face of concessions that modern games have made towards fun, Diablo 2's insistence on grind and unforgiving systems and 20-year-old bugs can just make me feel… tired. Satisfied, but tired.  What doesn't age? The mood. The completely redone graphics of Resurrected do so much more than a simple homage to the original game, adding a whole third dimension as well as 4K-friendly environment details that were just out of the question in the 800x600 2D graphics of 2000. Locations like the Monastery Gates in Act 1, an outdoor area that was always a bit weird from an isometric point of view, now have visible roofs on the buildings instead of just a black sea beyond the walls. There’s a wealth of detail in every scene, in the monsters, and in character models, that really makes me appreciate the ability to dynamically switch between the old and new graphics to see the contrast. Beautifully, when you switch to the classic graphics you switch to the original sound as well, though the difference is nowhere near as stark here because it didn’t need any significant updating. Aside from a bit of remastering it is identical to the original, and it’s still phenomenal. The ping when a gem hits the floor, the whirl of weapons, and the guttural demon voices (""Rakanishu!"") are iconic sound design. This is not to mention the remasters of the classic soundtrack, or the new remixes, which are beautiful work. (The voice acting, well... let's just say it was a different time. At least Deckard Cain and Tyrael are great – oh, and Baal in the expansion. That awful laugh still creeps right up under my skin.) In the “aged, but mostly gracefully” column we have the arc of Diablo 2's story, which is good, but it's not as good as I fondly remembered. The first two acts are really fun, and each quest is a dark, gothic fantasy vignette, while Act 3 is a great sprawling jungle crawl with lots of little dungeons sprinkled around. Act 4, however, is boring as dirt. The NPCs don't have any flavor dialogue, let alone personality, while the quests and the areas are entirely linear. I have no idea how a story about invading Hell itself could be boring, but Diablo 2 somehow did it. Thankfully, things pick up again with the Lord of Destruction expansion's Act 5. It's a bit rushed, but it's a good time. I chose a Paladin from the seven available classes as my first character for my grand return to Diablo 2. This is because for two decades I’ve maintained a personal grudge against the dung beetle soldiers in Act 2 – you know, the ones that poop lightning when you hit them. The Paladin's lightning resistance aura allows me to laugh in their faces and kill them in humiliating ways, and it’s been everything I thought it could be. That's part of the charm of Diablo 2, and it's still great design today. Some enemies are just immune to certain damage types, forcing you to diversify your build (or your co-op party). Others will burn out your mana in seconds, meaning spellcasters have to keep their distance while melee has to figure out how to win without active abilities. There's masochistic joy in overcoming the escalating challenges, especially when the escalation goes exponential as you break into Nightmare and Hell difficulties for character levels 30 to 99 or so. There’s no shame if you’ve had your fill before then and tap out, or start a new character for a fresh run, but Diablo 2 keeps on giving if you do.  The heart of Diablo 2 is still the multiplayer. Singleplayer is a fun dungeon crawl, but the difficulty and action feels best when you've got others along. Cooperative PvE runs to defeat bosses and farm good loot are where Resurrected shines most. The loot system is unreliable and random, assuming that players will trade items across games and characters to get what they need. The new, larger shared stash helps you do that, a small update that supports the original game rather than changing it. Building synergetic characters with a regular group is really rewarding, and classes like Paladin and Assassin only truly shine in a crew. There's also PvP, a niche and extremely hardcore Diablo 2 scene that's already starting to reestablish itself with its winner-take-all brawls. Personally, I fear these people, but I've already seen some impressive collections of ear trophies and unique weapons on social media. Some of the mechanical ideas feel old-school relative to how things are done in action RPGs these days, but that doesn’t make them bad. For instance, you only get two active skills at once. It seems archaic – and it is – but what was a technical and game design constraint at the time is pretty fun when you get past the clunkiness. You have to choose skills carefully, as having too many might just give you a huge toolkit you're not fast enough to use. There's a lot of juggling between powers. I like to smash my Paladin into the enemy packs with a Charge before switching to Zeal for a series of rapid blows, or Vengeance for elementally infused strikes that take down monsters resistant to physical attacks. For tough elite groups, I'll switch weapons and throw gas grenades to weaken them before I head in. All the while I'm swapping auras from attack speed to elemental resistances as I need them and keeping my holy shield buff up every 30 seconds. I also picked up a cool polearm-wielding desert mercenary sidekick. If you need any indication that it's very much still Diablo 2 under all of these fancy graphics, don't worry: He's still stupid as a sack of bricks and gets stuck on walls constantly. That’s one of those date technical issues that might have been addressed. There’s no shortage of options for skills and abilities, and part of the delight of Diablo 2 is that it has a skill tree system you can use to build some truly strange characters. It's flexible enough that you can make ranged builds for the melee characters, like a crossbow Paladin that shoots explosive bolts. How about a Barbarian focused on the War Cry skill, who just runs around shouting until everything dies? How about a Sorceress who enchants weapons rather than nukes enemies from a distance? I've always wanted to try and make a Necromancer tank, personally – maybe I’ll finally get around to it. There’s a ton of freedom… that is, if you're willing to discard 20 years of accumulated Diablo 2 wisdom and take your chances. In many ways this game is “solved,” in that the best builds and their precise itemization have been thoroughly sussed out over the years. In other words, there are right and wrong decisions, but you won’t know that unless you look it up or spend a lot of time failing. You're welcome to play like it's 2000 and not search out optimal builds, especially when playing on Normal. You can clear the campaign with pretty much anything if you're dedicated enough, though once you're in Hardcore or Hell difficulty melee characters are very dependent on getting good items to progress at any pace other than a snail's. However, while I'd normally encourage you to go in blind and experiment for yourself, I won't in this case because some of Diablo 2's design falls squarely into the “hasn't aged well” category. For example, there are copious skill traps for new players, meaning that some abilities you might be tempted to choose don't scale well past the early game, or aren't useful unless you understand their synergies with other skills you won’t unlock until much later. Additionally, some straight-up broken things, like the infamous Next Hit Always Misses bug, have been retained in the name of keeping the flavor of Diablo 2 the same as it’s always been – but that’s something few people know about unless they do their homework. Unfortunately, this faithfulness to the original’s bugs seems to be without limits: Skills like the Amazon's Fend and Druid's Fury are still bugged, breaking when interacting with other common mechanics. These are known, documented bugs that have locked off entire character skills for 20 years. Why are they still in this game? Wouldn’t it have been wonderful and fresh to let us explore that still-undiscovered country? To its credit, it's worth saying that I've encountered barely any new bugs specific to Resurrected, and those I have seen have been minor graphical glitches that don't affect gameplay – things like doors that don't change visually when opened but can still be passed through, or an object overlaying a texture strangely. Nothing out of the ordinary for a modern game. I’m a little sad to see that Resurrected has retained Diablo 2’s arcane skill-reset system: You get just one respec per difficulty level, and the only way to get more is by farming the big bosses for rare items and then shoving them in your Horadric Cube. Unlimited respecs would've been a prime candidate for overhaul to make Resurrected more accessible to a new generation and mitigate the skill trap issue, and it’s something that could have been easily disabled for ladder play. It's a bit galling things like that weren’t addressed because the other big update in Resurrected is a similar quality-of-life change. Rather than picking up gold stack by stack, you instead automatically grab it when you pass by. There's a difference between preserving the experience and maintaining a lack of respect for our time, and this change shows that a small tweak can go a long way towards removing tedium from the original game without ruining anything. The moment-to-moment gameplay that made Diablo 2 legendary in its time, though, is completely unchanged. Exploration and combat still feel deeply familiar; it’s a festival of clicking (or, now, thumbsticking – great on both PC and console) where you want to go and hammering out hits on your enemies. It's as wild and chaotic as an isometric action RPG ever is, but in the long view, over 20 years of game design innovation later, it's also kind of… slow. Characters don't move quickly, and running is limited by your stamina bar. Copious and consistent use of town portal scrolls (which both warp you back to base and let you return) generally avoids having to backtrack, but when you have to it's annoying at best. Running also makes your character worse at blocking, if they have a shield. Because of that, I didn't make it out of Act 1 without looking up the combination of slotted runes that produces armor with a bonus to Run/Walk speed, if only for – again – my own quality of life. At times, Diablo 2 feels like fighting against bad game design from the late ‘90s, which could also be described as “the forces of Hell.” For example, loot in online multiplayer is shared so anybody in your party can pick it up if they get there first – which I've got nothing against – but the careful etiquette of who gets what isn't reinforced by anything in the rules. I’ve already seen a lot of ninja-looting, and it sucks – and it's exacerbated by controllers, which can ironically loot faster than mouse and keyboard setups. Having to fight against the basic game mechanics like this isn't fun in 2021, and it'll be worse for new Diablo 2 players who expect this kind of thing to be dealt with by game designers instead of all of us deciding on unenforceable rules of etiquette. I've got other problems, myself: How can Blizzard justify dropping support for LAN play? Why can't I clone a multiplayer character into single-player? The latter is especially concerning, seeing as the servers have been temperamental at times and I’d rather not have to start from scratch when I want to play but the cloud doesn’t. But none of those devils in the details has overcome the fact that it's definitely fun. Diablo 2's design has aged remarkably well as an example of a relatively uncomplicated isometric action RPG. Everyone has skills, yes, but they all interact with the same systems: Health, Mana, Stats. There's no unique currency or meter to learn for every class, and combos are things you build rather than things you get from chains of esoteric item abilities and arcane end-game progression mechanics. It's just a skill tree, a billion demons, and an infinite fountain of equipment. It is, as ever, a satisfying game.  Diablo 2: Resurrected updates the graphics of a great, classic action RPG for a new generation. It masterfully preserves the mood of a singular game, and at the same time it preserves the gameplay as it has been for over a decade – mostly for better, occasionally for worse. Unfortunately, parts of that gameplay that were standard 20 years ago just look bad now, or feel like a waste of our time. Those looking for the old king can find it right here, but they might want to politely bow rather than kneel. "
199,Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania ,6.0,"Nostalgia is a funny thing. It can be a comforting sensation, but it sometimes makes things from the past seem better than they actually are. Unfortunately, the latter is the case with Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania, which compiles over 300 levels from previous Super Monkey Ball games and updates them for modern consoles. I have fond memories of playing the GameCube versions with friends nearly 20 years ago, so I expected Banana Mania to be a welcome return to those carefree nights staying out past curfew and rolling down increasingly difficult courses. Sadly, rollin’ just isn’t as fun as it used to be. As the name implies, Super Monkey Ball is a series about monkeys in balls rolling their way through hundreds of stages and avoiding increasingly difficult obstacles – and yes, it’s exactly as silly as it sounds. The GameCube-era graphics have gotten an overhaul that makes the cartoony art style more vibrant than ever, and I found it hard not to bop my head to the arcadey theme music. It’s always refreshing to see games that don’t take themselves too seriously in this era of increasingly realistic graphics and serious subject matter, and Super Monkey Ball is anything but serious.  Because Banana Mania is a mash-up of several previous Super Monkey Ball games, there appears to be an almost overwhelming amount of content at first. There’s the Story mode originally seen in Super Monkey Ball 2, which is less a cohesive campaign than it is about 100 levels across 10 worlds loosely stitched together with brief, dialogue-free animated cutscenes. Challenge modes from the first two Super Monkey Ball games appear as well, although the separate modes have some startlingly similar courses. And of course, Challenge mode doesn’t feel significantly different from Story mode gameplay-wise because the only twist is that you can’t pick up where you left off — you have to get through all of the challenge stages in a single sitting. So it’s more a challenge of endurance than anything else. The problem with both the Story and Challenge modes is that, after 30 or 40 levels, they both begin to feel like a slog. The difficulty in Story mode really ramps up around the halfway point, going from light and breezy to a frustrating exercise in failure very quickly. Early levels might challenge you to make your way around a winding path or keep your momentum going long enough to clear a gap; later on, you’ll be thrust into the air by spring-loaded platforms and fail the level before you even have a chance to adjust the camera to see a hazard you didn’t know would come at you from that direction. That’s exactly what happened in one of the levels that made me want to pull my hair out: before me stood a towering theme park ride made up of platforms connected to a pole in the middle. Because you can only tilt the camera up so far, I couldn’t see where the finish line was — instead, I had to roll onto a ground-level platform that thrust my ball upwards and try to figure it out in the air. The first time, I was thrown directly into a connecting pole and bounced off the map before I even had a chance to move. Other attempts ended after I landed on one of the higher platforms and bounced right off again. When I finally managed to land in the right place and stay put, it didn’t feel like I’d mastered the obstacles of that particular level; it felt like a lucky run that I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to replicate. If only a few levels were designed like this it’d be easier to dismiss that feeling, but after the halfway point most of them start to feel this way. And while the environments and backgrounds might be fun and colorful, much of the playable level design is repetitive and uninspired. The more I played past a certain point, the more it felt like a chore. What’s especially draining is that after finishing a particularly difficult level, there’s no satisfying adrenaline rush that accompanies overcoming a challenge — just a sense of relief that it’s finally over. Super Monkey Ball could’ve learned a thing or two from Peggle about dispensing serotonin. It’s telling that the developers actually included a couple of ways to deal with particularly tough levels. There’s a Helper mode that doubles the time limit and provides a visual path to the goal, which can be useful but usually doesn’t negate the bigger issues. It’s usually not a matter of understanding where the end goal is — getting there through trial and error or dumb luck is the problem. I can’t tell you how many times I just blindly rolled forward as quickly as possible, hoping that it would get me closer to the end, because every other strategy ended in failure. There’s also the option to skip a stage entirely, which is especially nice because it ensures that you’re never stuck on one frustrating level for too long – assuming that you don’t run out of the points you need to pay your way. You can earn points in various ways, but the most prominent are simply beating levels and completing certain challenges, like collecting all of the bananas in a stage. The Point Shop is where you’ll use those to unlock new characters, adding to the initial six-character roster of AiAi and his monkey menagerie. (Every character plays the same, but at least they look different.) You can even unlock a few non-monkey characters from other Sega games, like Sonic the Hedgehog, Jet Set Radio’s Beat, and Kazuma Kiryu of Yakuza fame, and playing as one of them even changes the bananas on each level to items from their respective games — rings for Sonic, spray paint cans for Beat. It’s a thoughtful touch, although the flipside is that these special characters can’t be customized with new outfits like the monkeys can. Looking back at my personal experience, the Super Monkey Ball games have always been at their best as party games, and that continues to be the case with Banana Mania. Party mode has a dozen mini-games, and most of them are genuinely fun and have surprising depth when played against other humans; for example, the Mario Kart-esque Monkey Race game has 12 tracks and multiple gameplay modes, and Monkey Golf has regular and mini-golf variations. Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania is one of the few games to offer same-system multiplayer in a time when almost everything is online-only, making party mode easily its most redeeming quality. As a solo experience, however, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania falls flat. More than once, I found myself wondering why I had liked these games so much when they first came out. Playing on PS5, I even turned on motion controls to try to replicate the magic of the early Wii game Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz, but that was a complete disaster. The simplest tilt of the DualSense controller had stages careening to the left or right, sending my monkey balls flying. It’s a shame that Banana Mania didn’t live up to the Super Monkey Ball experience in my memories, but times have changed; maybe it’s time this series touched a strange black obelisk and evolved, too. With over 300 stages compiled and upgraded from previous games in the series, Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania has plenty to do, but not enough of it is half as fun as I remembered it. Its levels quickly become repetitive and frustrating, and the bright, cheerful environments and silly characters aren’t enough to combat the tedium of retrying aggravating levels. When you consider the various gameplay modes, difficulty levels, challenges, and unlockables, it could take dozens of hours before you see everything, though you’ll likely run out of momentum long before that point. It’s much more enjoyable as a local multiplayer party game, so stick to party mode — or skip it entirely. "
200,New World Review in Progress,6.0,"Amazon’s New World is finally available in our world (which is now technically the old world, I guess?) and its servers are so packed on day one that I haven’t been able to get in yet. However, I’ve spent the past week running around a finalized version of this colonial-era MMO, albeit without nearly the same player count or queue times that many are currently experiencing. Note that, since I’m also responsible for a large chunk of IGN’s official wiki guide, almost all of that time was spent running around as a pre-made level 60 character and poking various Corrupted bee hives to see what I could shake out of them so that you don’t have to. But that has given me some time to get the lay of the land and get a sense of how everything works, so here are my initial impressions of this long-awaited MMORPG. The premise of New World is pretty simple: You’re a member of a pirate ship crew that’s gone out searching for a mystical island called Aeternum, which is rumored to be full of treasures. You land yourself in the middle of a storm that’s been infused with the island’s dark energy, called Corruption, and then you end up beached on the shore with nothing but the rags on your back and must contend with creatures and the rest of the island’s human inhabitants (survivors from past shipwrecks). Basically, it’s kinda like a Pirates of the Caribbean MMO with some high fantasy elements thrown in. This is perfectly fine as an original setting, and it’s great that Amazon Games seems to be taking expert consultation in crafting the real-world cultures and influences that it depicts. At least, that’s what it claims on the splash screen. However, I’ve yet to dig into its main story quests – meaning that it’s too early to say whether it’s compelling enough to drive me through what will certainly be a long journey.  It’s worth noting early on that this all looks downright gorgeous on Amazon’s Lumberyard engine (based on CryTek’s CryEngine), which does a great job of rendering real-time volumetric lighting and handling a large number of characters and effects at the same time. Not only are the draw distances quite impressive for an MMO, trees and grass all sway in the wind and cast accurate-looking shadows on max settings. In its favor, I get strong Witcher 3 vibes from New World’s overall look. Take note that my machine is pretty souped up – I’m running an RTX 2080 Super on a Ryzen 3900X with a whopping 32GB of high-speed RAM. As in other MMOs, you’ll start off by creating your character – though New World has a relatively modest sum of different faces and hair styles – then you’ll choose your name and you’re off to go. It doesn’t get any deeper or more complex than that, and there are no additional races or classes to choose from at the beginning. If you like to keep things simple, this is just fine – but it certainly doesn’t offer nearly the bevy of customization options that fans of Final Fantasy 14 or Black Desert Online might be familiar with. As soon as you get to the island you’re introduced to combat and basic questing. Don’t expect anything groundbreaking in either case. When you speak to an NPC who has a quest for you, you’ll get a page of dialogue and a preview of the quest’s reward, which in practice feels about as deep as any interaction you might have in World of Warcraft or Destiny 2. But at least these conversations are decently voice-acted. I haven’t decided yet whether I think New World’s combat can hold up over the long haul. It’s not all that different from other hack n’ slash RPGs, although it does often make you block, dodge, and break your opponents’ defenses in order to be effective. Enemies, especially the Dryads which you encounter later on, are also a bit more fierce than standard foes in other action MMOs – they’re more clever, and don’t simply stand around while you take swings at them. They’ll dodge and sidestep your attacks, making fights more dynamic than I’m used to. On our end, weapons feel good to swing around – your position and timing have a major impact on your efficacy in combat, though you’re locked into an animation once you activate an ability. This can make combat feel stiff if you aren’t timing your attacks, dodges, and blocks at the right moment. However, New World’s combat isn’t without issues. For me, those started when a swarm of enemies ran up and spammed their attacks in unison, making it hard to get enough shots in before they stunlocked me to death. I’m taking into consideration the fact that I’ve thus far played entirely solo and these encounters may be suited to groups of players, but still, these swarms are pockmarked all over the map, including in the middle of roads that I needed to travel through to get to the next zone. That doesn’t bode well for anyone who was planning to venture out alone. The rest of my issues with New World’s combat stem directly from its lacklustre character customization system. The classless approach is fine enough – building up your character is a matter of choosing what interests you and focusing on those specific skills, much like in The Elder Scrolls Online. On paper, there’s a decent pool of weapons skills to pick from. But this stalled progress for me when I realized you can’t meaningfully mix and match several skills at the exact same time. It makes sense that you can’t use Hatchet skills with a Rapier, but it’s disappointing there are no interstitial skills or spells outside of those lines. You don’t get to have a weapon in one hand and a bomb or fireball spell in the other. It’s not like there are any passive skill trees or armor skill trees that help you in all situations either – if you’re developing a weapon skill, you’re playing within that exact skill tree with absolutely no interplay between that weapon and anything else. It’s just fine, then, that you can quickly switch between two weapons in the middle of combat. For example, if you want to lure your enemies into close range with a bow, then take them out with a giant axe, you can theoretically make that happen... but you may not want to. This is because New World’s character customization – and subsequently, its combat – is held back by its limited attributes system. It shoehorns you into using only a small, carefully selected pool of weapon types per build. For instance, the Focus attribute is completely useless for anybody other than a Life Staff wielder – putting your points into Focus is a huge opportunity cost that pulls you away from putting points into Strength, an attribute which would be useful if you wanted to use a War Hammer but, like Focus, is completely useless for anybody holding a Bow or a Musket. But since you muddy your build by attempting to split your points between the two, your options are remarkably limited if you want to be effective. It’s an irritating limitation on what seems like it should be a flexible system that’d allow for all kinds of builds. Mercifully, you can respec your entire attribute build whenever you’d like – even in the middle of dungeons – for just a few coins. Weapon skills and their associated abilities are a separate issue entirely. You still need to grind these individual skills, like the Sword and Shield skill or the Bow skill, in order to build them up, and even then, there are a tiny number of attacks you can queue up on your hotbar. You’re stuck with only three special moves or spells on your hotbar at any given time (by comparison, The Elder Scrolls Online gives you six, and other MMOs basically have no limit). And the ones you do get to play with are tied directly to the weapon you’re holding, which means that playing with a specific weapon type almost always feels exactly the same, with the only variation being two distinct skill lines that you can follow within each weapon skill tree. But if you want to be the best tank, for instance, you will always play with a sword and shield and you will always dive into the exact same shield-focused skill line. My level 60 sword and shield-wielder (again, a pre-made character I was using before launch) didn’t feel all that different from when I’d created a first-level character. New World’s other major focus is its player-based economy, which is heavily centered around its crafting and survival elements. If you’re not into survival and crafting elements ala games like Minecraft or Don’t Starve, you may be very quickly turned off by New World’s absolute reliance on these things. Practically every item you need must be plucked off of bushes or mined out of boulders, then refined or crafted at trade skill stations in town. The kicker is that there are no NPC vendors whatsoever in New World. If you can’t find an item being sold by another player at the local trading post, which is specific to whichever settlement you’re currently standing in, you’ll need to go out and craft it or find it yourself. This is cool, if you’re into that sort of thing, because it gives you a tangible reason to build up your trade skills. But again, New World’s economy isn’t a fun side-activity that you simply dip your toes into between quests if you feel like it – it’s your lifeblood as you trek across this gorgeous haunted island. Harkening back to older MMOs, New World is also a much tougher game to move across. There are currently no mounts whatsoever, making it something of a slog to get across each zone – especially when encounters on the road can absolutely kill you and send you back to your original starting point if no other settlements are nearby. Fast travel exists, but is heavily restricted by the scarce resource called Azoth, which is difficult to acquire (but not so unreasonably difficult that fast travel is useless). Regardless, as soon as the server queues allow it I’ll be jumping in to begin playing New World with a fresh character from scratch one. Be sure to stick around and keep up with my adventure as it unfolds, and let us know what you think of New World so far in the comments. New World asks for the same quantity of time investment as any other traditional-style MMO, which means it desperately needs far, far more story content and gameplay variety to fill the gaps in its massive and visually gorgeous yet otherwise unremarkable world. The PVP endgame is where things start to get interesting, but the grind to get there is brain-numbing, the quests are hyper-repetitive, and the combat – while fun in the opening hours – just gets boring even after the first 50 hours spent hacking away. You and your friends can absolutely have some good adventures here, but it’s conditional on your willingness to endlessly grind and harvest materials, as well as on the health of your server’s community and its ongoing faction-driven rivalries. What’s left in the absence of that is a candy-coated shell of an MMORPG that struggles to evolve past its opening. But hey, at least you can pet a dog. "
201,Hot Wheels Unleashed ,9.0,"Perhaps best described as a head-on collision between an itty-bitty Burnout and a tiny Trackmania Turbo, Hot Wheels Unleashed is an endearing arcade stunt racer that feels great and looks absolutely remarkable. With tracks creatively weaved through lavishly detailed, life-sized environments, and brimming with a catalogue of cars spilled straight out of the toy bucket, developer Milestone’s decision to double down on a brand of racing 64 times smaller than usual has been a consummate success. Highly accessible yet full of advanced techniques, devilish shortcuts, and creative tools to master, Hot Wheels Unleashed is one of the best, most customisable, and most imaginative arcade racers I’ve played in at least a decade.  Hot Wheels Unleashed recreates the world’s most popular die-cast cars in their authentic scale, and in environments where they’re dwarfed by barn-sized basketballs and boom boxes as big as buildings. This makes Hot Wheels Unleashed more in line with pint-sized peers like 1998’s Hot Wheels Stunt Track Driver or 2007’s Hot Wheels Beat That! as opposed to styleless duds like Hot Wheels Turbo Racing or Hot Wheels World’s Best Driver, which simply super-sized the toys to race them like regular cars. Staying tiny was a terrific choice, and not simply because the atmosphere is endlessly more charming at toy scale; the 1:1 recreations of Hot Wheels cars here are regularly nothing short of stunning. The range leans towards more recent models – or, at least, recent versions of classic castings, like the iconic Twin Mill, and even a 50th anniversary version of the quirky Dodge Deora, one of the first 16 cars Hot Wheels ever made. There’s also a handful of real cars in the mix, which I think is great for variety and perfect for anyone who may not be huge fans of cars shaped like giant hamburgers. The small selection of film and TV cars are easily my favourites, though, and I don’t expect I’ll do much racing in anything but the Back to the Future DeLorean now that I’ve unlocked it. Finishing the campaign has given me some ultra-rare original models, which are great picks by Milestone. I do still have quite a few cars to unlock, though, and doing so is slow going because cars are only purchasable à la carte from a selection of five random models which rotates every four hours of play – not real time. That simply feels like too long; the only thing I want my kids to do for four consecutive hours is sleep. The remaining option is winning or purchasing blind boxes (which, thankfully, can only be bought with in-game currency) to try and get something different. Of course, the last time I saved up a pile of these I opened four of the same car in the space of a few minutes, which was deeply unsatisfying. That said, the car models themselves are simply gorgeous, and every one I’ve collected so far is an unflinchingly faithful recreation of the miniatures they represent, down to the tiniest details: the texture differences between plastic and lacquered metal parts; the subtle mould lines left from the assembly process; the broad range of paint finishes; the stamped text beneath the chassis carrying the model name and production year. I’m still finding myself just rotating them around, stopped in my tracks by how fantastic they look. As impressive as they are out of their boxes, they look even better after some doorhandle-to-doorhandle action out on track. Here’s where they really start to resemble the toy cars strewn around my youngest son’s room: chipped, scratched, and play-worn by the demands of their seven-year-old automotive overlord. The most striking thing is that damage hasn’t been applied thoughtlessly or randomly; cars correctly lose paint on their vulnerable corners and raised edges, faint scratches appear on larger flat surfaces, black plastic is revealed under the silver coating, and printed tampos are partially rubbed away. Under the right light, child-sized fingerprints can be observed – especially on windscreens – and even their plastic tyres become ringed with the kinds of gouges a pristine Hot Wheels car will pick up after an afternoon of pounding the pavement. Milestone’s success in making the cars look so credible is a huge part of what makes Hot Wheels Unleashed so joyful to play. This ridiculously good level of detail also extends to the environments themselves, from the scuffed and etched surfaces of the iconic soft plastic tracks to almost unnoticeable flourishes like air bubbles underneath hastily applied guardrail stickers. The backdrops are excellent, too – especially the vast cityscape buried in cloud that surrounds the construction site. What especially sells it is the outstanding lighting, which regularly comes from multiple sources all around each map, whether that’s the neon of a jukebox, brash fluorescent tubes, or the glaring sun itself. The lighting seats the cars into the environments outstandingly well. The level of granular detail seems to speak volumes about how deeply everything has been considered here, and it all combines to create an extremely believable miniature world. It’s sometimes a little hard to soak in at speed, but there’s a brilliant camera mode included to ogle it all up close. My only issue with the camera is that it seems tied to the track rather than the horizon, so anytime my car was racing upside-down or vertically, the camera axes become muddled and adjusting it to find the shot was a bit of a brain-breaking exercise. “Okay, Luke,” you’re probably saying. “It’s pretty and tugs at the heartstrings of the Hot Wheels faithful. But how does it play?” Fair! And you’ve probably been waiting for the other shoe to drop... but in a surprise twist, Hot Wheels Unleashed handles very well, actually. Its arcade-typical brake-to-drift racing is intuitive and easy to pick up, but there’s a lot of nuance hidden in its air controls. Once mastered – or, at least, moderately tamed – the air controls can be exploited to uncover sneaky shortcuts, sail over opponents, or salvage a misdirected jump. Boost builds nice and quickly, though the higher your car’s core stats are the less boost you’ll have at your disposal. This creates an interesting balancing act, as opting for a weaker car overall will give you more boost to compensate. Personally, I prefer to upgrade my cars as high as possible and work with fewer boosts, because I think I’m faster this way… I think. There are four levels of AI, and the slowest seems very tolerant of mistakes and a good starting point for the young or the less experienced. Medium proved to be a surprising jump for the kids in my household – it’s far less forgiving and they often found it tough to catch the pack after even a single respawn – but it was much more satisfying for me. Hard and above really demands upgraded cars. Tracks range from simple to highly technical, but track design is brilliant across the board. Constructed with curving and twisting stretches of Hot Wheels tracks but linked with segments of the environments themselves, one moment you’ll be powersliding across orange plastic and the next you’ll be whizzing across benches, air vents, shelves, and the floor itself, flanked by tiny cones. Particularly impressive is the use of every axis, with magnetic track making vertical climbs, drops, and even racing across the roof possible. It means that, while six maps doesn’t sound like a lot on paper, in practice the way Hot Wheels Unleashed utilises the layers of each level – and every nook and cranny they contain – keeps it feeling fresh throughout the duration of its mostly kid-friendly campaign. Every event has a lower-end goal that it will reward you for achieving and allow you to continue, but there are tougher goals for completionists – and some of the later time trials really forced me to experiment and search for high-risk shortcuts. I can only speak anecdotally, but so far Hot Wheels Unleashed has done a good job at entertaining both kids under 10 and a 40-year-old car nerd, although I feel like a few more race types would’ve been nice. Pursuits in little cop cars, or eliminations, or just... something else. As it stands, there are just races and time trials, and the online options seem barren as a result. That said, my kids have taken to playing a makeshift brand of tag in splitscreen on the floors of the maps. Splitscreen is two-player – not four, sadly – but it runs very smoothly on Xbox Series X and has been an absolute hoot. Even if you do get tired of the available tracks, Hot Wheels Unleashed features an extremely deep custom track editor to let you build and share your own. You’re not limited to just clicking together pre-set corners and lengths of track, either; tracks can be shortened, lengthened, tilted, twisted, curved, and buckled in any way you see fit, and elevated or dropped anywhere. It probably took me a full afternoon to come to grips with the tools, which are quite complex, but once I really learnt how to bend the editor to my will I was able to create Mt. Barf-O-Rama, a monster that wrapped itself around and through virtually every piece of furniture in my Hot Wheels-themed basement. I am expecting big things from the user created tracks. Fun, fast, and damn near photorealistic at times, Hot Wheels Unleashed is a surprising and brilliant arcade racer. Carefully detailed, highly customisable, and buoyantly uncynical, this toy racer defies all expectations with remarkable attention to detail, excellent track design, and an accessible handling model that still rewards high skill. The racing may be tiny but make no mistake: this game is enormous fun. "
202,Kena: Bridge of Spirits ,8.0,"It makes sense that Ember Lab, the developer of Kena: Bridge of Spirits, started out as an animation studio. Just looking at this gorgeous world and Pixar-esque character designs tells you that this is a team that has a ton of experience in making incredible digital works, including their Majora’s Mask fan film, Terrible Fate. While Bridge of Spirits' gameplay doesn’t quite match the extraordinarily high bar set by its visuals for a number of reasons, including some bland storytelling and shallow progression, this 3D open-world action-adventure is still nonetheless an impressive achievement thanks to its exciting and deceptively simple combat and an excellent balance of action, puzzle solving, and platforming. Kena is a Spirit Guide who helps spirits who are unable to move on to the next life, whether because of lingering guilt or unfinished business. The story follows her as she makes her way through a beautiful but dying land in search of its sacred mountain shrine, guiding the troubled spirits she finds along the way. Not enough good things can be said about the character designs, facial expressions, and animation in Bridge of Spirits, which do an amazing job of making everyone you meet immediately endearing – especially Kena herself.  She’s so likable, in fact, that it actually makes it a bit of a bummer that we never really get to learn all that much about her. You get hints of her background and history, but never anything that lets you get to know her in the same way you get to know the spirits and other characters that she ends up interacting with. It’s a shame because she's the one we spend the most time with, and everything else about her is awesome and made me want to know more. In many ways, Bridge of Spirits is a throwback to the classic 3D Zelda style of games of having a large overworld that’s split up into major zones, and then guiding you through them in a linear fashion. Each zone will then require you to collect X amount of Y item, fight a boss, and then snag an upgrade that lets you travel to and explore the next zone. It’s very simple and formulaic, but it works elegantly: each area is home to a corrupt spirit that Kena needs to save, and as you explore the region you meet other characters who were close to the spirit, learn about the history of how things went wrong for them, find their personal effects, watch flashbacks, and then everything culminates in a boss fight that ties a nice little bow on the story arc. Combat, on the other hand, is absolutely nothing like Zelda’s. It’s fast-paced, deceptively simple, and surprisingly challenging on the normal difficulty level given its cutesy and colorful demeanor. You’ve got light attacks, heavy attacks, and the ability to use your staff as a bow for ranged attacks, and... that’s about it in terms of your primary offensive tools, from beginning to end. Combat options were so limited, in fact, that I actually was pretty let down in the early goings because most enemies could be killed with just one or two light attack combos, and I wasn’t given much reason to do anything else for a lot longer than I’d have liked in a game that only lasts about nine hours. Some nuance is introduced in the form of your tiny and adorable Ghibli-esque sprites, unfittingly known as Rot. These little dudes aid you in battle by swarming an enemy and temporarily locking them down, giving you an opportunity to attack their weak points, or just focus on clearing out the surrounding enemies. The ability to command them is tied to an amusingly contextualized Courage Meter that builds up as you deal damage, emboldening them to put themselves in harm's way to help you out. What really redeems Bridge of Spirits’ combat is that after a while it begins to introduce new enemy types that strongly encourage you to change up your tactics and explore some of the subtleties of its limited tools. Whether that’s making use of your bow’s time slowdown by jumping into the air and aiming at hard-to-hit weak points, using a parry against an attack that’s difficult to dodge, or using your Rot to immobilize a tough enemy so you can attack them from behind. There’s an impressive amount of enemy variety, and once they started showing up to the party I felt like I was constantly being challenged by new and interesting scenarios. That’s exactly how it should be in a game like this. You also have to manage your resources very carefully in battle once the difficulty starts to ramp up significantly later on in the campaign. Not only can you use Courage to lockdown enemies with the Rot, but you also need to use it to heal by cleansing specific areas in a fight. There’s rarely more than two of these healing spots in any given scrap were, which makes every bit of damage you take incredibly significant, and often you have to make the call of whether you want to use your courage to be able to survive another hit, or use it to cash in a bunch of damage on an immobile enemy or boss.  That said, it would have been nice to have a little more to do in a fight. Bridge of Spirts’ progression system doesn’t provide very many enticing options to evolve your fighting style, and made me feel pigeonholed in my approach to combat – especially because there’s one melee weapon, and that weapon never really got much better or different as I continued to play. You can upgrade your moves, but the impact of those upgrades is disappointing to say the least. Three of the four melee upgrades are abilities that feel like Kena should have from the outset (two dashing attacks and an overhead slam while in the air) the post-parry counterattack doesn’t feel much stronger than just attacking while the opponent is recoiling, and many other upgrades are just small and barely noticeable incremental improvements. I never once thought “It would be nice if I could fire five arrows instead of just four,” especially considering how fast arrows regenerate. There are exceptions, of course: a charged bow shot that deals big damage at the cost of one bar of Courage, a slow hammer strike that could take out a group of enemies at once, and the ability to activate slow-mo while aiming without having to jump in the air were the kind of new techniques I was looking for more of. But aside from these, I never felt excited by upgrades because they rarely ever seemed like anything that would be especially useful or make combat any more fun. Fighting baddies isn’t all you’ll be doing in Bridge of Spirits, and the fact that it balances combat, platforming, puzzle solving, and exploration so well is one of its strongest suits. You’re never doing any one thing for too long. After finishing up a challenging combat encounter, you’ll typically be challenged to solve some sort of puzzle to open the next area, sometimes commanding your small army of Rot like Pikmin to move objects in order to press down buttons, or give you a platform to stand on. Once you get the bomb powerup, you’ll regularly do fun platforming sequences where you must activate a series of platforms and figure out how to best get from point A to B before the platforms return to their natural states. And then on top of all of that, this is an open world with plenty of secrets hidden off the beaten path, though whether a majority of those secrets will be of interest to you is another story. My one gripe about exploration and collectible hunting is that, with the exception of meditation spots ( which increase your max health) none of the collectibles really made much of an impact on my playthrough. For context, I’m someone that really doesn’t care all that much about cosmetics, which is why I never felt super compelled to seek out Bridge of Spirits’ collectibles when most of the time they just ended up being either new hats for my Rot or currency that I could use to buy more hats for my Rot. Sure, there are Cursed Chests, which are fun to track down because they force you to complete a combat challenge in order to open them – but it's almost always disappointing when you go through a tough battle and your reward is… yet another a funny little hat to put on one of your funny little creatures. So I pretty quickly lost the motivation to do more of it. One final area that deserves a special mention is the boss battles, which are some of the most intense and challenging I’ve fought all year. Every fight feels distinct, the big ones have appropriately epic music, and there are a lot of them too. Some of the smaller boss battles even wind up becoming regular enemies that you have to fight against later, and that’s a nice way to revisit some of the most fun and difficult fights. Kena: Bridge of Spirits is a wonderful first game from Ember Lab, combining its outstanding pedigree in art and animation with some really solid combat, fantastic world design, and a great balance of action, platforming, puzzle solving, and exploration. The result is an open-world action-adventure that harkens back to the days of the N64/Gamecube-era Zeldas, Okami, and Star Fox Adventures, while also adding some modern sensibilities and a distinct personal touch. It is elegant in its simplicity, though sometimes that simplicity left me wanting more options to vary up my combat approaches, and I never got to know Kena herself as well as I wanted to. Even so, outstanding enemy variety and intense, memorable boss battles more than carry it through its nine-hour adventure. "
203,Eastward ,8.0,"A man and his adopted daughter find their way through a whimsical, post-apocalyptic landscape. Frying pan and psychic powers at the ready, they might stumble into saving the world as they explore it. With all the stylings of a retro JRPG, you might expect Eastward to play like one, but this chill action-adventure is more Zelda than Dragon Quest. John and Sam's triumphs and mistakes take place in a charming pixel-art landscape that's rich with lovely characters and intimately designed places. Even where the story dragged for a time, or the simplicity of the challenges felt patronizing, the parts of Eastward that spoke to me more than made up for them. Our headliners are John – a silent protagonist wreathed in messy hair and a bushy beard – and Sam, an outrageously precocious girl with budding psychic powers and a penchant for getting the two into trouble. They're lovable characters with a bushel of personality and a kind of timeless appeal. They set off from their home under dubious circumstances, and, eventually, find their way... eastward.  I loved switching between the two as they travel through a cute but dangerous apocalyptic world of small towns and dam-cities. Along the way you play through discrete story chapters and explore the stories of the people you meet. There are a lot – a lot – of silly little minigames along the way. Baseball, river rafting, slot machines, and ever-present cooking.  The trek to the east is pretty linear, but the areas you explore are laid out like little dungeons, with curling paths to find your way through as you battle goofy monsters and solve simple puzzles. John does most of the fighting via simple but satisfying hack-and-slash action, but Sam's powers – like freezing enemies inside big psychic bubbles – are useful for fights and vital for puzzles. It took me a few more than 30 hours to beat the main quest, but I know there are secrets to explore and little NPC storylines I skipped over that are worth going back for. In fact, Eastward's overall story is good enough that I've judiciously avoided spoilers in this review, to the point of being overly vague in some spots, but trust me, that’s for your benefit. There's also a pretty detailed roguelite JRPG game-within-the-game, called Earth Born, to play – and it was fun enough that I spent about six additional hours on it. Eastward's real draw is its world. The vibrant pixel art landscapes are so creative and so packed with detail that I often found myself stopping to just look at a city street or a new railway station. Much of it is alive with little animations like running water, glinting metal, or spinning fans. I loved details like laundry on lines between buildings, boats overturned and made into houses, and countryside in the distance from train windows. It's a loving rendition of a world that's somewhere between a Studio Ghibli film and a classic JRPG – Castle in the Sky meets EarthBound. It's all overlaid with a pretty low-key soundtrack that's nothing standout, but it’s good enough, with a variety of both instrumental and chiptune arrangements. It's not just the backgrounds that pop, though. The characters of Eastward have great sprites and animation that packs in a ton of personality. They're a cast of well-designed weirdos who all have something unique going for them, which is an animated style that's become all too rare. The style and personality of the people you meet differs wildly, varying from gruff ranch hands to a trio of lively aunties, a sleepy small-town mayor, or a cigar-puffing casino owner. That's not to mention the circus performers, train conductors, conmen, and funky robots. (My favorite robot runs a construction company and has a bad hip.) Little fetch quests make you run back and forth across the world, but that's not so bad when that world is pretty. A lot of the best Eastward has to offer is just smiling at the guy meditating on a roof as you pass by his part of town. I’ve passed him a dozen times now; what is he doing up there? I don't know. He's happy. Dude's just vibing and it's nice. Earth Born is Sam's favorite game, and she loves the tie-in cartoon, too. It's a retro throwback to the Final Fantasy 1 or Dragon Quest era of 2D RPGs with a randomized roguelike twist, and it succeeds in invoking that era while still being a modern game. Earth Born consoles pop up in most of the major settlements alongside token-operated dispensers that spit out Pixballs – toys-to-life doodads that give you reusable boosts while playing – which you use to get further and unlock new party members inside Earth Born. It's the icing on top of Eastward's cake, even though it's entirely optional. So I guess it's more like the chocolate sauce on Eastward's ice cream sundae. As rounds of combat go by, characters accrue action points that they can use to fuel their most powerful skills. Knowing when, and against what enemies, to use your skills is the key to progressing. As you explore Earth Born's little branching world you pick up new party members, and a larger party lets you swap through more characters during each combat and start with more characters each run. They've all got something unique going on: there’s the Monkey, who helps even when not on the front row during fights, or the Merchant, who doesn't use the action-point system but instead uses accrued gold to do battle. I quite liked the tactics available in the turn-based combat, though if it were a real-world game it’d quite honestly be a ""pay-to-win"" experience because getting more Pixballs makes it easier and easier each time you start a new run at it. It's hard to be upset when the bonuses are something you earn in the course of finding secrets in the main game. Either way, it's a welcome change of pace from Eastward's more sedate stories or fast-paced combat. For some, I expect it might even be the highlight of Eastward. It's a relief that the world is so attractive and the characters are so appealing, because Eastward's greatest weakness is its writing. Character dialogue is hit or miss, with more than a few cliche lines and real stinkers. I'm talking about unironic use of lines like ""I've been running my whole life."" Frankly, it's because the writing doesn't know when to step back and let action or movement convey words. It uses two sentences when one would do – or, more often, one sentence when none would do. Dialogue that should pop up in the background – laughter, exclamations – is more often than not in a bubble that requires a button to progress. The only time I felt impatient or bored with Eastward was during the drawn-out dialogues. Exploration and combat are a welcome break from all that staring and reading. Fights are simple, and most enemies can be easily defeated with judicious application of John's frying pan. Everything else is susceptible to the neon-colored shotgun or flamethrower. There are lots of weird enemies though, like a giant frog person, tentacle plants, or ultra-tough zombies, and they've all got their own attack pattern – but I usually took them down the same way, no matter what they were. But let me be clear: Simple isn't always bad. It was fun to weave around attacks, smack mutants with a pan, and blow them away with the shotgun. It's weird that while you swap to Sam pretty often to do puzzles, I rarely felt the need to use her in combat; her ability to put monsters in frozen bubbles comes in handy for a few things, but you don't absolutely need it to win. If you had a psychic sidekick, wouldn’t you want her to do a bit more? Likewise, it’s a bit of a downer that the puzzles Sam’s instrumental in solving are never too complex, only ever getting difficult when it's a challenge of timing or skill – or to get at a few tricky hidden chests. Most often, you'll have to notice something like a wall to blow down with a bomb, a puzzle of which cables to connect, or which obstacles to remove so a raft floats where you want it to. The harder puzzles will have a timing element – moving quickly after triggering a switch, or golf-swinging a bomb into a narrow opening from a moving platform. It’s not complex stuff. The simplicity did bug me sometimes. While parts of the fighting are good in their straightforwardness, others are just basic. Partially it’s because the single-stick controls feel inadequate for aiming weapons. It's fun to bash with a frying pan, not so fun to make sure the characters are both dodging incoming projectiles. The relatively infrequent boss and miniboss fights are an exception there, requiring a bit of finesse and switching between both John's weapons and Sam’s powers. I liked them a lot more than the platforming and puzzle bits, and a lot of them really tested my ability to use every tool in my arsenal for a clean victory. One in particular stands out, an enemy knocks away bombs that you try to place at a vulnerable point. To win, I needed a deft hand at dropping bombs as John, then to switch to Sam to use her powers to distract the enemy, then back to John to dish out damage after the bomb went off. That’s the kind of synergy Eastward’s combat needs more of. A delightful journey from beginning to end, Eastward has charming characters and beautifully animated vistas to explore. The story is nicely plotted and the chapters tell self-contained stories that are darkly amusing, if a bit overwritten. The simple combat, relaxed puzzles, and cute minigames keep gameplay variety high and the pace upbeat enough to carry you through to the end of the story. "
204,Lost Judgment ,7.0,"The Yakuza series and its spin-offs are renowned for juxtaposing simmering crime drama plots alongside quirkier complementary diversions, but Lost Judgment is the first time that the side dishes have turned out to be more satisfying than the main course. An intriguing murder case at its center doesn’t quite go the distance thanks to a lack of late-game twists and turns and puddle-deep detective gameplay, but a surprisingly absorbing series of optional investigations that place returning star Takayuki Yagami undercover at a Yokohama high school go a long way towards redeeming the overall adventure. When a body is found decomposing in an abandoned warehouse, the prime suspect has an airtight alibi: getting caught committing an entirely different crime at the exact same time the warehouse murder is believed to have taken place. It’s a provocative jumping off point to be reunited with private investigator Yagami and his likeable crime-solving cohorts, and it kept me enthralled in its opening hours as a series of contradictions were picked apart and modern concepts like deepfake technology were posited that made me feel like I was leading man in an episode of CSI: Shinjuku.  This initial intrigue doesn’t last, though, since all of the major parts and players in Lost Judgment’s main case have been identified and unmasked roughly by the start of the third act, which means any sense of mystery evaporates from there on out as the characters talk in circles and at length while re-examining the same pieces of evidence without revealing any new details. I kept waiting for a rug-pulling plot twist that never arrived, and despite the customary escalating boss fights in Lost Judgment’s closing chapters, I couldn’t help but feel like it was just going through the motions. I felt equally apathetic towards Yagami’s detective work which, despite some minor tweaks and additions, remains as disappointingly shallow and inflexible in Lost Judgment as it was in the original. Quick-time event-heavy chase sequences are repetitive and often ridiculous, running laps of the same small circuit and always seeming a few comedic toots of Yakety Sax away from being an actual Benny Hill skit. Meanwhile, the covert tailing missions are slightly less frustrating this time around thanks to the ability to press a button to “act casual” and hide in plain sight, but no less plodding. Then there are the parkour sections, which are clunky enough to make an Assassin’s Creed fan want to fall on their hidden blade, and the stealth scenes that force you to throw coins in very specific spots to distract guards before you can take them out (just quietly creeping up behind them greets you with a greyed-out button prompt and no course of action other than to scurry back to your overtly signposted hiding spot). The added detection gadgets, like a highly sensitive microphone and a detector for hidden cameras, are certainly welcome but in practice they’re effectively not that different from the simple crime scene pixel-hunting from Yagami’s first outing. The one aspect of Lost Judgment’s sleuthing that does feel a bit more involved is Yagami’s ability to eavesdrop on conversations between pedestrians in order to pick up certain words or phrases that can be used as search terms in the Buzz Researcher app on his phone. In doing so, he can sift through a feed of text messages and triangulate specific points on the map where new clues might be uncovered. It’s still relatively restrictive since you can only use the exact search terms you’re given, but as far as actual deduction goes it at least made me feel I was getting my hands dirty rather than merely having them held. And yet, despite all of these gripes, I can’t say that I didn’t end up enjoying my time with Lost Judgment overall, and that’s almost entirely thanks to the surprisingly meaty undercover side cases that Yagami can undertake at the Seiryo High School. Playing the role of a Japanese Johnny Depp in a 21 Jump Street-style high school sting feels refreshingly novel, and I enjoyed posing as a choreographer for the school dance squad or helping the robotics club refine their machines, while simultaneously sniffing around for clues to the identity of an unnamed professor suspected of recruiting students into criminal activity. These school stories often spill out into interesting places outside of the school grounds, and also do a great job of contextualising a lot of the mini-games found in Lost Judgment. The amount of time I spend in the virtual Club Segas found in Yakuza games has diminished with each subsequent sequel over the years; however, in Lost Judgment I was forced to brush up on my Virtua Fighter 5 skills in my efforts to endear myself to the school’s eSports team while I investigated one of its members accused of cheating in tournaments. I appreciated the way Lost Judgment cleverly takes previously peripheral ingredients and makes them feel vital. In all, there are 10 different school societies to be infiltrated and investigated, combining to add more than a dozen hours of compelling casework to the package. It’s shocking to me that these are all entirely optional, since I found them to be far more engaging and mechanically diverse than anything offered by the main story. This is despite the fact that, since they’re treated as ‘side missions’, they’re sadly not given the same level of slick presentation gloss as the fully-voiced cutscenes that flesh out much of Lost Judgment’s main mystery. My only major issue with the schoolyard subplots is that in a game that details the potentially horrifying ramifications of bullying, including youth suicide, you spend a surprising amount of time as a grown man beating the absolute snot out of teenagers. It only takes a few pranks played on the maths teacher for Yagami to morph into the meanest form of Mr. Miyagi and send a gang of troublemakers from the classroom to the emergency ward, which seems more than a little contrary to Lost Judgment’s virtuous main message. Thankfully, the majority of Yagami’s street fights are contested against consenting adult combatants. Unlike the turn-based battles of 2020’s Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Lost Judgment stays true to the real-time Streets of Rage-style beat-‘em-up action that the Yakuza series was built upon. That suits me, since my personal preference is for pulling off a swift combo-based beatdown rather than get bogged down in menus puzzling over which defense spell to cast next. In addition to the Tiger and Crane fighting styles that return from the original Judgment, Yagami now has a Snake style, which is heavy with slippery parry moves, and I gravitated towards using it more often than not thanks to the satisfying counter-attack opportunities it consistently creates.  However, Lost Judgment just can’t compete with Yakuza: Like a Dragon when it comes to sheer enemy variety. Whereas Like a Dragon packed in enough colourful characters to overcrowd the world’s angriest-looking Where’s Wally? poster, Lost Judgment just pits you up against more or less the same stock-standard street punks in the vast majority of its brawls. The scraps certainly increase in challenge as you go on, with gang members swelling in numbers and bringing in more deadly weapons like katanas and flamethrowers, but it ultimately feels a bit stale when the thousandth head you crack has the same scowling facial texture as the first. Speaking of textures, the Kamarucho and Yokohama settings from Like a Dragon remain every bit as detailed in Lost Judgment, and as dazzling as ever to walk around – particularly at night. Yagami has access to a detective dog named Ranpo who can be used to sniff out hidden secrets, but I also enjoyed the simple pleasure of just peacefully walking him through the neon-lit streets. However, it’s a shame that Lost Judgment’s environment isn’t quite as functional as that of the last Yakuza, and indeed while vending machines are on every other street corner, you can’t actually buy items from them like you could in Like a Dragon. Instead you need to hustle to the nearest Poppo anytime you want supplies, ironically making these convenience stores seem somewhat inconvenient by comparison. That extra legwork is mitigated somewhat by the inclusion of a skateboard, which ex-lawyer Yagami can magically whip out at any moment to go from lapsed legal eagle to wannabe Tony Hawk. However, it’s unfortunately pretty clumsily implemented. The button you hold down to run is the same one that activates the skateboard, and so I frequently found myself accidentally skating into a cluster of pedestrians and stacking it when I was merely trying to sprint past them. That made getting around substantially more stop-and-start than I’d have liked. Besides, cash is so easily earned that I was more inclined to just order a taxi from Yagami’s phone than I was to try to reach anywhere on foot. In fact, while Lost Judgment has an incredibly long list of features and some of them are really well done, skateboarding is just one of many that looks good on paper but is not so good in practice. It’s true that you can race in violent Road Rash-inspired motorcycle races, try and grind your way to high scores in a warehouse skate park, and go undercover at a Russian school for ninjas. But it’s also true that the motorcycle races are hampered by stiff controls and an impractically low chase camera, the skateboarding tricks are on rails (and not in the good way), and infiltrating the ninja school basically amounts to playing a game of darts and getting dragged along into yet another monotonous chase sequence. In some ways, Lost Judgment is a bit like a gacha machine – all those toys sure seem enticing and varied when you look at them through the glass, but once you dispense a capsule and crack it open you realise they’re surprisingly cheaply made and you’re suddenly not sure whether you actually needed it in the first place. By that same 100 yen token, there are a lot of really fun activities that only emerge over time. I was over 30 hours into my playthrough and well beyond rolling credits on the main story before I unlocked a robust arcade boxing mini-game, complete with 24 different opponents and its own levelling system and unlockable special moves, for example. I've still only uncovered three out of the 12 game cartridges you can play on the Sega Master System in Yagami's office. And what’s this? A hilarious mini-game where you have to drunkenly chat up barmaids in the local nightclub? There are certainly a lot of hidden delights to be found digging around in Lost Judgment's sandbox, as long as you’re prepared to invest the time and take the good with the bad. Despite its intriguing whodunnit premise, Lost Judgment’s main story fails to sustain its suspense all the way to the finish and its detective methods remain only slightly less superficial than those of the previous game. However, its meaty undercover side stories set in and around the Seiryo High School kept me playing for hours and hours well after the main story credits had rolled, in doing so revealing a lot of fun surprises that I might never have found had the classroom cases not kept me on the hook. This Yakuza spin-off feels far from being considered case closed, but here’s hoping that Sega can show some better Judgment in the series' future. "
205,Skatebird ,5.0,"One-part tiny Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater and one-part Micro Machines, Skatebird is a little bit like a Photoshop Friday pun parody brought to life; it’s extremely small birds riding Tech Decks on small-scale stunt ramps scattered around a messy bedroom, plus various locations around an office. Beneath the joke is an ambitious attempt at a 3D arcade skateboarding game, and it’s heavily inspired by the early Neversoft Tony Hawk games. The result is cute, earnest, and undeniably eye-catching, but it’s also pretty unrefined, light on content, and regularly irritating to play. The general vibe is as though someone brought up the legendary aforementioned Birdman and someone else sprang up from their empty pint glass and exclaimed, “Birds, man!” – only instead of cobbling together a crude JPEG of a pigeon doing a 900 they spent several years building a bona fide video game based on a loose gag. Developer Glass Bottom Games has obviously injected a boatload of bird-themed touches throughout, but the studio sticks largely to the Tony template: big air, wild tricks, and an assortment of maps sprinkled with tasks to complete and letters and tapes to collect.  The key influence appears to be Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 4, where Neversoft dropped the iconic two-minute timer in favour of allowing players to cruise the maps searching for individual mini-missions. Like THPS4, Skatebird doesn’t supply an overt list of challenges before each level and time every run; you need to skate around the environment and find NPCs – or NPBs in this case, I guess – scattered around the map to discover the challenges you need to complete. While challenges themselves are timed, the lack of a countdown clock on general exploring suits Skatebird’s relaxed nature – an atmosphere that’s served very well by its catchy set list of original, bird-themed tunes. The soundtrack itself is easily the most polished part of Skatebird, and it’s stacked with relaxing, skate-friendly earworms full of bird calls and samples of overzealous nature filmmakers from public domain documentaries. It’s very well done; even the birds enjoy it, bopping along as they skate. Unlike THPS4, however, Skatebird doesn’t highlight fellow birds with missions to assign you in any particular way, so skating around searching for the next mission can sometimes be a punishment. They’re not hidden, but you do just have to coast about until you happen upon them. Also, sometimes the birds disappear after you’ve completed their mission, and sometimes they don’t – but there’s no distinction between the birds who remain on the map after you’ve done their mission and have nothing further for you to do, and the ones that do have a new task for you. This meant I often found myself skating up to (and directly through) birds with no objectives for me while combing the map for the one that did. The tasks are generally very easy, and the time limits Skatebird provides to collect stuff and build scores are mostly very generous. Items and letters required for individual objectives are often placed quite close together in a single area of the map, but even if they’re more spread out an onscreen marker will lead you directly to them. Unfortunately, this tends to make a lot of Skatebird’s challenges surprisingly boring, with collection closer to a formality than a challenge (except whenever some dodgy hit detection decides you didn’t grab an object despite literally banging it with your beak, or skating through it several times). There were a few challenges I did get hung up on for a few extra attempts, but the headache in these instances was mostly related to the jankiness of the camera and the controls. The camera often struggles to smoothly track the avian action onscreen, and there were plenty of occasions when I got temporarily trapped in 90-degree corners or other random parts of the level, sending the camera into a tailspin. It’s also a bit taxing to get out of a tight squeeze; having the birds flutter to turn on the spot may look authentic but in practice it just makes it cumbersome and sluggish. There’s a huge amount of imagination on show in Skatebird, from the greasy pizza box ramps, to the fake issues of Thrasher rip-off ‘Thrusher’ magazine bent into quarter pipes, to the plastic straws acting as coping, even if the overall art style is a bit basic and angular. It’s cute, too, and there’s certainly something to be said about a game that lets you be a galah wearing a piece of bok choy for a hat, or a cockatoo cosplaying as the first guy to always get arrested at a music festival. Glass Bottom Games has leaned hard into the feathered framing of Skatebird, and I certainly can’t accuse it of lacking originality, even if I’m way too old for heckin’ satirical zoomer misspellings of words like “birb” and “screm.” Once the novelty of birds on toy skateboards wears off, however, the skating itself is revealed to be quite rough. It’s easy enough to bash out a few flips and grabs, but the tricks seem quite limited and they’re neither very exciting to watch or easy to distinguish from one another. Grabs in particular are boring, and the way birds instantly snap into stalls makes these feel noticeably unfinished. What’s more, there are also only five levels available, including a small, barren, and boring rooftop level that’s disappointingly plain and really a poor showcase of Skatebird’s shtick. With no multiplayer and minimal maps there really isn’t a ton of game here. Skatebird is a cute and original arcade skating game supported by great music, but the skating itself is crude by modern standards, the objectives are generally uninspired, and the camera is a regular hassle. It has a lot of charm, but overall it’s not really worth raven about. "
206,I Am Fish ,7.0,"I Am Fish is without a doubt the weirdest game I’ve played this year and appears to have been made by insane people. In other words, I really enjoyed it. It’s an intentionally frustrating physics-based platformer and a literal fish-out-of-water story that challenges you to overcome ridiculous obstacles. Escaping captivity is not always as fair or forgiving as I’d hoped and sometimes can be downright infuriating, but overcoming its preposterous challenges is frequently a thing of beauty. As a glutton for punishment, I found I Am Fish to be a challenging, entertaining ride that had me laughing, cursing at seagulls, and occasionally sobbing uncontrollably on the carpet as I had to restart a section yet again. This is a bizarre, over-the-top tale of a quartet of fish who eat sentient bread (which you might remember from I Am Bread) which awakens human-like sentience and intelligence in them. Naturally, they use this to wreak havoc on their human overlords and absolutely destroy entire towns, like a nihilistic retelling of Finding Nemo. It’s truly one of the weirdest premises I’ve ever beheld and it kept me laughing and shaking my head in disbelief the whole way through – around 10 hours.  Perhaps weirdest of all is how I Am Fish develops and expands upon the stories from I Am Bread and Surgeon Simulator, giving lots of backstory and exposition to those games in what appears to be an incredibly ill-advised attempt to establish the BGU (Bread Gaming Universe, obviously). And honestly, I’m here for it. The completely absurd attempt to create a cohesive series out of a tongue-in-cheek bread game only adds to the charming stupidity that called to me in the first place. Like I Am Bread before it, the main obstacle you face in I Am Fish is that your playable characters are just really darn difficult to control, yet precision is almost always required. And when you’re constantly under threat from everything, like cars running over you or, oh, I don’t know – coming into contact with air for more than a few seconds, you should expect to die a lot. As I floundered to direct a rolling fishbowl or flopped my way into a body of water, I never felt like I was completely in control of the aquatic animals, which is equal parts annoying and hysterical. If I added up all the times I shouted something like “Oh, give me a break!” at the screen and gave you the number you’d probably think it was my least favorite game ever, but it’s all by design. I cried tears of joy when I finally made it past a particularly annoying section where seagulls were trying to kill me while I rolled around in a glass bottle, and I cracked up as I was repeatedly run over by cars. I Am Fish has four playable fish, three of which have unique abilities that must be mastered to solve puzzles. The piranha, for example, can bite and destroy just about anything in his path, while the flying fish can, well, fly. The introductory levels for each fish are total highlights, where your new abilities are fresh and puzzles gradually become more challenging as you learn to make the most of your latest set of fins. There are some really stellar levels, like one where you’re swallowed by a drunk man at a club and have to make him stagger to a bathroom from within his stomach before he barfs you up. Or when you roll your fishbowl over the rooftops of a town using the electrical wiring like guide rails. Figuring out how to think like a fish and overcome absurd obstacles is a completely worthwhile experience, even when you’re dying a ton. That said, not all the frustration thrown your way is fun; some sections cross that delicate line from being entertainingly annoying to just making me want to turn it off and play something more casual, like Demon’s Souls or Battletoads (1991). The bottle sections in particular just feel downright cheap sometimes, as I found myself wriggling helplessly in a very unwieldy bottle while trying to navigate extremely precise landscapes. In another, I found myself painfully inhibited by my own AI-controlled allies who eagerly followed me wherever I went and constantly got in my way, causing me to die half a hundred times or so. These kinds of extreme and uncalled for frustrations actually made up a not-insignificant amount of my time with I Am Fish, enough for me to develop a kind of love-hate relationship with it. To make matters worse, some sections go way too long without a checkpoint, which forced me to replay parts repeatedly, each time more irritating than the last. It’s unfortunate that it tried so hard to tick me off sometimes, because when things came together I didn’t mind or even notice how much I was dying just because the obstacles thrown at me made me laugh. But I Am Fish pushes those limits pretty regularly and laughter is replaced with deep sighs and stress eating. iframe allowautoplay="""" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/i-am-fish/49772/gallery/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery49772"" scrolling=""no"">
If the normal controls are somehow not difficult enough for you, there’s also the Bossa control style, which makes you flap the thumbstick around like a fish’s tail in one of the most insane control schemes I’ve ever used. For masochists interested in a swift kick in the pants, this can be pretty entertaining, though I can’t see myself ever wanting to put myself through that kind of agony for longer than a level or two. I Am Fish isn’t very long, with only 13 levels that I was able to beat in 10 hours or so with a fair amount of goofing off, but there’s quite a bit of replayability to it. Levels are mostly linear, but usually have a few different paths you can use to reach your goal. You can also chase star ratings by finding the fastest route through levels and completing speedruns with as few deaths as possible. Naturally, collectible pieces of bread provide an optional challenge – they’re found on the most difficult or out-of-the-way routes to encourage further pain, if you’re into that sort of thing. Collecting enough pieces of bread and earning higher star ratings also unlocks one bonus level, which makes replaying levels and honing your skills a worthwhile endeavor. I Am Fish is wacky, hilarious, and sometimes agonizing, but still well worth the time for those with a stomach for it. Its intentionally maddening controls and platforming are gimmicks that sometimes overstay their welcome, especially when bad checkpointing and cheap deaths undo all your progress, but most of the time it does a good job at balancing difficulty and rewarding persistence. Even after hundreds of humbling deaths, its lasting charm stuck with me the whole way through. "
207,Lost in Random ,8.0,"Imagine stepping into an original D&amp;D setting that’s been lovingly written and DM’d by Tim Burton or Shel Silverstein. Instead of elves and dwarves, you have a giant card shop that’s also a person, a decadent duke, and a scary-looking upside-down guy who only dreams of being able to rhyme – just to give a few examples. That’s the wildly creative premise of Lost in Random, a wholly original action-adventure game that thinks outside the box. Its combat wears thin, but exploring its worlds never does. You play as Even – one of two twin sisters, Even and Odd – who are fated to roll the Queen’s mystical six-sided dice at age 12. The resulting roll determines which of the six worlds in the kingdom of Random they’ll spend the rest of their lives in. Long story short: Odd is sent off to the Queen’s world but Even isn’t willing to let her go without a chase.  The world-spanning adventure that ensues after you manage to escape the dreary starting zone of Onecroft, takes plenty of nods toward films like The Nightmare Before Christmas, Corpse Bride, Coraline, and other similarly gothic-inspired stop-motion films. Despite the entirety of Random being drenched in dark hues of black and green and gray, each world still offers completely unique and decadently layered settings. For example, Two-Town’s denizens feature two directly opposite personalities that can shift each time the Queen rolls her dice. This has resulted in the construction of a separate Two-Town, called the Upside-Downtown, which completely obscures the town’s skyline, kinda like that one scene out of Inception. It makes Two-Town feel that much more immense, and you can tease apart as much or as little of the zone’s background story as you’d like through side quests, or by speaking to the many interesting NPCs hanging around town before moving on. Meanwhile, Threedom and its people are trapped in a perpetual state of war over a series of petty squabbles between the three outlandish Triplets. The other, equally otherworldly characters of the world react to them in weird and unexpected ways that keep you guessing. For instance, you’re constantly told about Lost in Random’s appropriately named and visually terrifying Shadowman. You hear snippets about this terrifying monster that stalks the shadows and snatches lost children who wander too far from home, but when you finally meet him he’s frustrated that the war is too distracting and no one’s paying attention to him. This is just one of many ways that Random feels lived-in and richly detailed. And these otherwise creepy characters are made lovable through the genius of Lost in Random’s writing. Incredibly memorable characters like Mannie Dex, Seemore, Herman, Ooma, The Nanny, and so many others make moving to the next world kind of like watching the next movie in a 20-hour series of timeless holiday classics. Then there’s the semi-real-time combat, which as you probably guessed from the name, leans heavily on dice rolls and cards. It’s sort of like Final Fantasy 7 Remake’s combat system, but it’s a bit simpler once you get used to these very random rules. You start each battle with your trusty slingshot, which allows you to shoot crystals off of the faces and bodies of your foes. Once you’ve collected enough of them, a new card is added to your hand – up to a total of five cards. The part that makes this interesting is the fact that each card in your hand is randomly pulled from your much larger deck – which lets you store up to 15 cards at a time, including duplicates if you want a few cards to show up more regularly than others – and you have no way of predicting which cards will appear when you roll your dice. Don’t worry if this sounds too weird, because most of the cards you can equip in your deck include the usual mix of swords, healing potions, and bombs. The real-time part of combat kicks in when you spawn a weapon and button-mash your foes to death or until your weapon breaks. All of this “cards” business would shuffle Lost in Random’s real-time combat around and make it more appealing than the average button-masher if the enemy’s AI wasn’t so easy to outsmart with such minimal effort. There are two issues here. The first issue is that you’re never prompted to select a difficulty level unless you go digging into the menus after already having spent some time playing. The other issue is that, on the default difficulty mode, each foe is packed with a lot of hit points, and a single battle might still take about 20 minutes or longer – simply because of how many of them will spawn before you’re finished. Regardless, each of these enemy types are pretty slow and predictable, and it’s easy to use any damage-dealing card to beat them down without thinking too hard. It feels great for the first few battles, especially when you’re playing with interesting card combinations like Blacksmith’s Blink and Crystal Curse – the former giving you the ability to deal damage when you dodge roll your way through enemies, which causes crystals to break off of them, and the latter giving you the ability to deal damage each time you break those very same crystals – but the novelty does eventually wear off. Combat encounters end up appearing a bit too often, slowing down the pacing of the otherwise excellent story and dialogue sequences that make Lost in Random truly shine. This sprawling action adventure has way more meat on its bones than you may first expect if you’re only looking for a quick dive into a Tim Burton-esque wonderland. Lost in Random is loaded with tons of side quests, interesting lore, and a decent semi-real-time, semi-turn-based combat system that ends up getting bogged down by dumb enemy AI. Beyond that, the five worlds that follow the relatively drab intro section each offer their own unique quirks, struggles, and characters that won’t be forgotten any time soon. "
208,Call of Duty Vanguard Multiplayer Review in Progress: Beta Impressions,7.0,"Call of Duty Vanguard sees Call of Duty returning to its roots… once again. It does that a lot. The first multiplayer beta opened up this weekend for anyone who preordered on PlayStation, and I spent a fair number of hours getting my feet wet ahead of its November 5 release date. If you, like me, have been playing the last several iterations of CoD, you will probably feel a sense of familiarity with Vanguard's multiplayer. Actually, let me rephrase that: you might feel like this is last year's Call of Duty MP with a WW2 skin. The only thing keeping me playing Vanguard instead of going back to Black Ops Cold War are a few interesting new modes. Team Deathmatch, Kill Confirmed, and Domination are back, as you’d expect. However, Hardpoint, a mode I never really liked, has been changed to a new Patrol mode, which I definitely like. Rather than capture and hold static points, Patrol has you protecting a small circle of territory that moves along the map (hence the ""Patrol"" moniker). When a team of internet randos comes together to cover and capture this moving target, it's really fun. It's far and away my favorite addition to this year's multiplayer, as it encourages both active and passive team coverage and discourages camping.  Well, long-term camping at least. Since the contested area is constantly moving, it's in the best interest of long-range shooters to post up in a sniper nest for just a few minutes. The area moves from wide-open spaces, to inside buildings, and back out again. It's great, actually. It requires using all your shooting skills: close-quarters, mid-range, and long-range, all within the course of a few minutes. In all modes, close-quarters combat is where I'm finding the most frustration with Vanguard's multiplayer because it’s tough to tell who’s on which side. Last year's Cold War pitted NATO forces against Warsaw Pact forces, whereas this year (at least in the beta) both teams are made up of the same Allied characters. More than once, particularly in the Hotel Royal map, I didn't know who was who. If you're melee-close to someone, the indicator over their head just can't be seen, and even at a distance the muted red indicator often disappears into the muddy ochre and brown tones of the map. Thankfully, friendly fire is not a concern here (there's no Hardcore mode in the beta) because there are split-second moments where I’ve made the wrong call. Also, plenty where I’ve hesitated when I shouldn’t have and got smoked. I understand in 2021 no one wants to play as the Axis powers, but some sort of distinguishing feature between the two teams other than a small dot with their name in red would go a long way. I like being able to tell when I'm being approached by an enemy player by their character model rather than their Activision gamer name, and I don't want to have to git-gud at increasing my speed glancing up at the words floating above their head. One mode where this isn't a problem is the new Champion Hill mode, a cool twist on the battle royale formula where instead of fighting to be the last team in an all-out war, you're instead running around in what's basically a glorified paintball battlefield. The premise is simple: you join a two- or three-person team, get dropped into an arena, and work to eliminate the other teams. There are 10 teams in all, each randomly battling one another 2v2 or 3v3, until only one team remains. During the matches you earn money you can use during breaks in the competition to buy upgrades like weapons, perks, and buffs, or spend during the match to upgrade your weapon. It's fun, but matchmaking took a long time no matter what I tried. I’m not sure if that's due to lack of interest or because it's still in beta, so I can't really fault it for that unless it persists in the final game. Speaking of maps, the three that’re available in the beta are... just okay. Of the three, Gavutu, a rain-soaked South Pacific location, is probably my favorite because it has most of the features I like in a mid-sized MP map: a corridor up the middle, a wide-open space on one side, and a more clustered group of obstacles and buildings on the other. It still doesn't quite feel right because in spite of the wide-open nature of the seaside of the map, it still feels a touch too small for the features it uses and during the course of the beta I never really got a feel for the ""flow"" of it. Hotel Royal, a small map with lots of CQC, is my least favorite of the bunch (in part due to the aforementioned friend-or-foe issues), while the Stalingrad-based Red Star gives me no strong feelings one way or another. I did appreciate how much Red Star reminded me of Call of Duty 2 from way back in the day, but other than that nothing really stood out to me about it. My opinion on the maps may change as I get more familiar with them, and week 2 will also open up The Eagle's Nest, a map based on Hitler's mountain stronghold (where it will be even weirder to not be fighting people dressed as Nazis). Rank and loadout progressions have returned and appear to be exactly the same as they were last year, which was, in turn, very similar to how they felt in 2019's Modern Warfare. You create your loadout with primary and secondary weapons, lethal and non-lethal weapons like grenades and Molotov cocktails, three perks, and your killstreak bonuses. Using a weapon during a match unlocks upgrades like optics, magazines, and different barrels, among others. Gaining rank with your Activision account opens up more weapons and modifications and… yeah, it's pretty much exactly the same thing as last year, so it’s difficult to get excited about. One thing missing from the beta are unlockable skins, which add nothing to the gameplay itself but always push me to grind at least a couple of my favorite weapons to their highest levels. Hopefully those come back for the final game. There’s a very thin line between a nostalgic experience and an archaic one, and it’s a line that Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War's Multiplayer has not quite managed to balance on. It feels like an old-school shooter at times which sometimes feels great but all too rarely, with simple map designs and underwhelming additions to playlists failing to hit the mark. If you’re looking for a quick burst of fun multiplayer action then there’s just about enough here to keep you entertained for an evening, but not much more than that. With some weapon balancing on the way and hopefully more maps and modes available in the future, there will be more to enjoy in Cold War’s multiplayer; I just can’t see it taking my time away from Modern Warfare or Warzone anytime soon. I did notice some weird ranking issues in both my profile XP and my weapon XP. Sometimes, for several matches, I'd accrue no XP whatsoever, in spite of all my efforts. Then, without warning, it would ""catch up"" and all the experience from the last 20 matches would suddenly appear at once. All the unlocks would come in a huge, delayed wave, which meant I wouldn't be able to apply any upgrades to my weapons, or use new weapons, for extended periods of time. It meant missing out on the satisfaction of progression level to level, which is hopefully something they iron out before release. The weapons also feel pretty much the same as well, which is to say that they feel modern and not World War 2-era at all. I understand the reflective sight actually predates World War 2 by a lot so it’s not technically historically inaccurate, but it still feels very odd to have them on small arms. The kill streaks, like the Recon Plane and Glide Bomb, are just the Spy Plane and Cruise Missile streaks from last year (and those were just versions of the UAV and Cruise Missile streaks from the year before). I appreciate the feeling of familiarity from year to year, but part of me hoped for new, more novel killstreaks to feel more era-appropriate instead of just relabeling them. Additionally, skill-based matchmaking returns to Call of Duty in Vanguard and you're probably not going to like it if you're an old salt. Playing on PS5, which I'm admittedly not great at, I appreciated it. I usually play on PC and have a hard time adjusting from the joy of mouse and keyboard to controller-based play. For less competitive players like me, who just use CoD as an excuse to play online with friends for dozens of hours each fall, SBMM is a great way to ensure you win some and you lose some. But because you always play people of the same relative skill, there's no way to know where you stand in the great player database in the sky. There's also no way to shut it off, so it looks like a VPN remains your only option to skirt the algorithm if you'd rather not be matched with the same caliber of player. In short, I enjoyed myself during my weekend with Vanguard – especially in Patrol mode matches – but not as much as I’d hoped I would. It's hard to know if it's the so-so maps, playing with a controller instead of my preferred mouse and keyboard, or because it just feels so much like Black Ops Cold War with a WW2-era skin on it. It's still fun and I know I'll put in many hours when the final game comes out, as I do at the start of every Call of Duty cycle, but there's nothing really new here to get me excited about it. Hopefully my opinion will change as multiplayer evolves before its November launch, but if I had to score it right now I'd probably give Call of Duty Vanguard MP a 6. Remember, this is a beta and that score is in no way final, so be sure to check back around launch. With a strong cast of characters used to varying effect throughout to tell a tale that puts just about enough of a spin on the stories it's paying homage to, Call of Duty: Vanguard’s single-player campaign is an impressively cinematic depiction of World War II. That said, aside from a few standout moments sprinkled over its fleeting five hours, for the most part it plays it a little too safe in regards to mission variety to feel like a standout in the series. It may look and sound spectacular, but it could’ve used more stylish sections like Petrova’s to distinguish its gameplay from the many battles we’ve fought before. "
209,Tales of Arise ,9.0,"I’ve got a long history with the Tales series. I was absolutely obsessed with Tales of Symphonia back on the GameCube, beating it at least four times, and I’ve been chasing that special kind of JRPG love for years – mostly without success. I’ve played Abyss, Graces, Hearts, and the acclaimed Vesperia, but they all felt like too much of a retread. Even Berseria, which felt like a good refresh for the series, didn’t do much for me. But Tales of Arise has finally rekindled that flame, feeling both like a brand-new game with an outstanding story and excellent combat while also making good use of the best ideas that have kept the series going for this long. The Tales series is known for how well its stories are told, and Arise is no exception. In fact, Arise is now my favorite in the series, exceeding Symphonia. It centers around Alphen, a slave with a mysterious past who cannot feel pain. He is charming and helpful, going out of his way to assist anyone in need and acting as a protector of his fellow slaves. He shares the lead role with Shionne, a member of the slaver race who cannot be physically touched without cursed magic thorns erupting from her body. Watching their relationship grow from contentious but necessary to actually becoming friends is one of my favorite parts of any game in 2021.  The other characters also learn and grow, which felt good to witness. There are not just worldwide stakes but interpersonal ones as well; everyone has their damages and they must learn how to cope and deal with them. Without spoiling anything, the story touches on the horrors of war and slavery, the long-lasting affects of colonization on indigenous peoples, the realization of one’s own privilege and how it relates to others and the less fortunate, one’s purpose in a damaged world and what they can do to help, and more. But that’s not to say everything is dour – there are plenty of moments that made me laugh out loud or smile because of how charming the well-rounded and flawed characters can be, and they’re made even better by a stellar voice cast. Tales of Berseria is a surprisingly strong showing for this long-running series. Its tragic story of broken people fighting on the wrong side of history makes it utterly compelling, and its well-tuned combat more than makes up for its lack of interesting environments. Simply put, this is a tale too heartbreaking to miss, or to forget. Devil May Cry or Bayonetta. For instance, the perfect dodge mechanic gives you a second of slow-motion after an enemy’s attack and teleports you into range for a counterattack. The classical and rock-inspired music during fights goes along well with this, making it all feel exciting. Arise continues to use the free camera that debuted in Berseria, which makes the use of Artes, or special moves, much easier to aim in the midst of a fight. Using Artes and perfect dodges will build a meter that puts your character in an overdrive state that gives you a costless use of Artes and access to a Mystic Arte, a kind of finishing move. On top of that, Alphen has a risk-reward mechanic of expending his health in order to strengthen his attacks. Another of Arise’s clever new additions is that all six characters come with a special skill mapped to the D-pad that is used to counteract anything an enemy can do. For instance, Rinwell the mage has an interruption ability that not only stops an enemy from casting a spell but steals it, allowing Rinwell to cast it during that fight. Or, if you run into a shielded enemy, Law’s ability can break through that shield, opening the enemy up for damage. And while you can only have four of the six characters in battle at a time, you can still use all six of their skills at any time. (You can also open up the menu during battle and switch out any character you’d like, or even change out what Arte a character has equipped, so letting us use all of their abilities at once just saves us the hassle of manually switching them out.) This combat sundae is already expansive and wonderful to engage with (there were many moments where I said, “Cool!” out loud, to no one but my dog) and they’ve topped it with the cherry of flashy combo moves between two characters which looks more like something out of Guilty Gear Xrd instead of an RPG. There are so many extravagant effects and flourishes that I worried at first that it would be easy to get lost in the chaos of it all, but it remains so readable that I never once lost track of what I was doing or where my character was. It’s very friendly to learn, too – whenever one of these new mechanics pops out, a tutorial comes along with it to get you more familiar with it while adding an entry into the menu in case you, like I did, forget how to pull something off. (This kind of thing isn’t all that uncommon in modern games but I always appreciate it.) Further along, an arena becomes available where you can tackle solo and group challenges, which helped me understand the flow of combat even better. After grasping the new combat system, the ultimate test of skill comes in the form of two things: big monsters that you can find in the open world, and boss battles. Usually coming at the end of each area, bosses typically have a wider combat arena than normal and area-of-effect skills that can take out your whole party if you’re not careful. While these fights might take more effort, they never overstay their welcome or feel unfair. Every boss fight feels like a culmination of the area it takes place in, from making good use of the new abilities you’ve learned there to expanding how the enemies you’ve fought there use their attacks. Even when you’re not actively fighting, everything you do feeds back into the combat. There’s a crafting system for making better weapons with materials found from ore around the map and from items dropped by enemies. There’s a cooking system that gives various bonuses from attack to defense and even buffs for finding better materials. There are cute little owls scattered about that give you costume customization pieces, which in itself does not give you any sort of combat bonuses, but collecting enough will unlock other useful things to use in combat. And that’s not even mentioning walking off the beaten path to find items and rare monsters that drop even better loot. I never once felt like anything I did was wasting my time; in fact, I intend to go back for more so that I can play at a more leisurely pace and soak in everything I want. Though exploring the world is fun to do, Arise does have an expansive fast-travel system that takes a lot of the slog of backtracking out of the equation. It’s just one of the many quality-of-life improvements over previous Tales games that kept the pace of the story and action going over the entire 50 hours. I’m very pleased to say that Bandai Namco has hit the mark in reinvigorating the 26-year-old Tales RPG series. Tales of Arise brings to life a beautifully realized world with a story that isn’t afraid to tackle heavy subjects and knows when to take its foot off the gas for a bit. Its characters feel real and relatable even in fantastical situations, and a fresh and fun combat system livens up their battles. Combined with plenty of quality-of-life improvements ironing out some of the series’ long-standing frustrations, this is an easy recommendation to not just fans of the long-running series but anyone interested in diving into an expansive action-RPG. "
210,WarioWare: Get It Together! ,7.0,"If Mario Party is a full meal, WarioWare has always been more like a bag of popcorn: a quick, delicious snack, but try to eat it for dinner and you’ll be craving something meatier before long. WarioWare: Get It Together! is no exception, with rapid-fire microgames that are a delightfully wacky test of both reaction speed and problem solving – this time with the interesting new twist of using unique characters that control differently. But while Get It Together! looks great and can be a lot of fun, some dud characters and its fleeting multiplayer modes keep it from being a regular part of a balanced party game diet. All of Get It Together!’s madness is introduced through a brief but entertaining story mode, the entirety of which takes about two hours to complete. The story itself involves Wario, now a game developer himself, and the employees at his company getting sucked into the video game they are making to do battle with its bugs. That setup has nothing to do with playing the actual microgames, which give you a word or two of instructions and just a few seconds to follow them before throwing you to the next one, but the short cutscenes that kickoff each stage and the conversations between them can be very amusing.  But we’re not here for the plot, and WarioWare’s single-player modes have always been more about going for high scores in a variety of ever-escalating themed playlists rather than beating them once and moving on. That’s a fun challenge, particularly with the later playlists that have a larger pool of microgames to throw at you. The story levels are also playable in co-op this time around, which is certainly a nice inclusion, if one that can feel like a “little brother mode” since the games seemingly haven’t been adjusted for two simultaneous players. Solo or co-op, however, Get It Together!’s assortment of microgames provide exactly the kind of madcap hilarity I want from this series. One second you’ll be removing a statue’s armpit hair and the next you’re scrambling to feed baby birds. The fan-favorite, Nintendo-themed games are also a joy, asking you to do things like deliver a present in Animal Crossing or complete a teatime in Fire Emblem. There’s a healthy mix of ridiculous moments and quick challenge here too, which allows you to tangibly improve as you begin to recognize levels. That familiarity is mitigated by the new unique characters. There are more than a dozen to use, each with abilities and movement styles that can give the same microgame a different flavor when you swap between them. For example, Wario himself can fly anywhere on screen freely and punch left or right with the press of a button, while his pal 18-Volt is stuck sitting still as he shoots discs from his head to affect the level from afar. They each have their strengths and weaknesses for certain microgames, and story levels ask you to pick a roster of three to five characters that you’ll randomly swap between, adding some additional spice to stages you’ve beaten a dozen times. Both the characters and the animations accompanying these playlists also deserve a shoutout for just how good they look. Get It Together! isn’t trying to push the bounds of modern graphics or anything, but the elaborate backgrounds between each microgame and the overall art direction are vibrant and full of personality. Tons of life has been poured into areas that could have otherwise safely blended into the wallpaper – including with the characters themselves, who use adorable 3D models that are made to look like chibi 2D sprites, making them wonderfully expressive despite their minimal designs. But while the roster is visually diverse, some of these characters are just objectively worse versions of others, mechanically speaking. Why would I ever want to use video game enthusiast 9-Volt, who is stuck constantly skateboarding left-to-right and can throw a yo-yo directly upward, when the robot Mike can also shoot upward but fly anywhere on the screen freely while doing so? Similarly, the dog-cat duo Dribble and Spitz can fly but only shoot right or left, respectively, whereas ninjas Kat and Ana have the exact same directional restriction… but can never stop jumping up and down, making them far worse. Meanwhile, the popular witch Ashley blows all the folk I just mentioned out of the water by being able to fly while shooting any direction she likes, and a unique option like the terrifying mother 5-Volt can be borderline unusable for some games since she only moves and attacks by teleporting. As a result, despite being given free choice of the roster, it felt like I was avoiding half of my options like the plague. There are definitely still enough good ones to keep the story levels interesting, but it’s a shame that “the same but worse” was used as a template so often. The other half of the WarioWare coin is its multiplayer, which is hit and miss in Get It Together!. There are a total of 10 modes in a section called the Variety Pack, which range from head-to-head microgames to co-operative score-attack minigames to other oddball entries like a fighting game. The three score-attack modes are largely dull (including a super boring side-scrolling platformer, which I never actually finished a full run of without quitting because it was just so mind numbing), but the PvP options can be a lot of fun… at least, for a little while. Apart from one of its two solid 1v1 modes and a janky volleyball minigame that’s only good for a couple rounds of entertainment (hot tip: 18-Volt is completely busted in this one), none of the four-player PvP modes actually let you pick your characters. Instead, they’re usually randomly picked and frequently changed, which feels like a truly baffling decision. That includes a clever territory-capture game with its own small set of unique PvP microgames (which are cool, but unfortunately get old fast since there are so few) and a Smash Bros.-style fighter that had promise but is let down by forced mid-match character swaps, causing it to devolve into the bad kind of party game chaos. Only two of the seven modes that allow for up to four players are even about completing the regular microgames (one of which is WarioWare’s returning balloon inflation mode) which leaves Get It Together!’s multiplayer in a very strange spot. Everything about completing these games and the zany, unexpected madness of adapting on the fly can be a good time with friends, but you are given so little control and things are so random that none of it holds its shine for more than a few rounds. I absolutely enjoyed myself while I was playing, but after trying everything the Variety Pack had to offer, there’s not enough of lasting interest here to ever make Get It Together! a staple of my party game rotation like past console WarioWare games were. To give credit where it’s due, Get It Together!’s story mode manages to make good use of its characters (at least the ones that don’t suck), and the genuine appeal of chasing high scores solo is further emphasized in the Wario Cup mode – a weekly unique score challenge with ranked leaderboards. It’s hard to tell how much long-term appeal this mode will hold having only seen two brief but entertaining challenges so far, but it is another neat inclusion to keep things fresh. That said, for having a ranked option, it’s a little strange to me that your score is partially influenced by how much you’ve engaged with Get It Together!’s cosmetic gacha system. Don’t freak out: there are no microtransactions here whatsoever, so that’s good. However, completing games will earn you coins that can be spent on loot boxes that contain “Prezzies” of various rarities that are then given to characters to level them up and unlock cosmetic recolors. It’s a relatively ignorable system for those who don’t care and a decent (if perplexingly convoluted) way for dedicated players to be lightly rewarded for their time – but your character’s level will also increase your ranked score in Wario Cup for some odd reason. That’s not the end of the world in a goofy single-player score-attack mode with no real-money way to buy Prezzies, but it is a confounding decision all the same. WarioWare: Get It Together! is an absurd delight, testing your ability to think quickly and adapt on the fly in a series of ever-escalating microgames. That tried-and-true formula is still a lot of fun here, looking better than ever and introducing unique characters that can either bring interesting twists or mechanical frustration to familiar games depending on who you’re using. It’s a shame that Get It Together!’s multiplayer options somewhat drop the ball though, enough for an evening or two of laugh-out-loud fun with friends but lacking the staying power for many more beyond that. "
211,WRC 10 ,8.0,"2021 officially marks the 49th season of the World Rally Championship, making WRC 10’s 50th anniversary content… a fraction premature. Of course, after nearly two years of total turmoil it’s hard to blame anyone for wanting to celebrate their birthday early – the World Rally Championship included. To mark the moment, WRC 10 arrives armed with the most retro content to grace developer KT Racing’s series so far, with a new mode featuring cars and stages representing five decades of rally racing history. Combined with a deep career mode, the result is the spiciest and arguably the strongest official WRC game to date – though that’s a narrow victory, since it still hasn’t changed dramatically since the already very good WRC 8 and WRC 9, and it’s still making some of the same minor mistakes.  That big 50th Anniversary mode is an important part of this year’s game, and it’s by far the biggest injection of historical content to the series since KT Racing started adding classic cars in WRC 8. With its own separate menu and period photography it does feel quite special at first, although there’s ultimately not really a great deal to it. They’re just a small collection of time trials with a little bit of text to explain the historical context of what you’re about to do. One significant issue that some may have with the Anniversary races is that the time requirements don’t scale with the global difficulty setting. Inexperienced racers can dial down the intensity of their career and quick race difficulty, but at the time of review, Anniversary mode cannot be changed. I thought I was cruising when I notched up the first two events on my first attempts, but that changed on the extremely tough third event (which is actually the fifth event, because confusingly the third and fourth event got skipped and remained unavailable). At least a couple of the time requirements I’ve subsequently encountered in this mode so far have been surprisingly stiff; certainly severe enough for less experienced racers to bounce right off this mode entirely. It seems strange for WRC 10 to cater for new and novice players with a variety of settings, driver aids, and tutorials, but opt for a hardcore, one-size-fits-all approach for the marquee Anniversary Mode. The good news for anyone stumped by the taxing time limits in Anniversary mode is that all of these cars – and the historical stages – can be used in identical fashion in quick play without any such pressure. WRC 10 allows us to put any car on any stage, historical or modern. The older historical stages are a fun addition because KT Racing has stripped out the contemporary advertising and safety features of the modern stages and replaced them with crowds of more period-authentic spectators, many of whom are poised dangerously close to the roadside. WRC 10’s old-school crowds aren’t anywhere near as thick as they were in the heyday of Group B bedlam but they definitely contain a few folks whose lifelong dream is to be killed by a rally car. Things obviously don’t get that grim, but the often-cramped crowds do make the historical stages a compelling challenge because just the tiniest touch to a stupid spectator will instantly respawn you on track with a stiff penalty. KT Racing has done very well selecting a range of rally cars that really matter, and a lot of world championship-winning cars are represented. The classics garage stretches from the Alpine A110, the winner of the first WRC in 1973, all the way to Ott Tänak’s 2019 Toyota Yaris, which famously ended 15 years of the championship being won by blokes called Sébastien. There’s plenty of iconic metal in between, too, like a pair of fire-breathing Audi Quattros, several Lancias (including the mighty Intergrale), the Peugeot 205, the Toyota Celica and ’99 Corolla, the 2007 Ford Focus RS, the Volkswagen Polo R, and a handful of successful Citroëns. Colin McRae’s 1997 Subaru Impreza and Tommi Mäkinen’s 1998 Mitsubishi Lancer Evo V are two other legends you may have access to, but as of launch they’re currently tied up as either console pre-order incentives or deluxe edition content. Broadly speaking, however, it’s a very good spectrum of both drivers’ and manufacturers’ championship-winning cars; there aren’t too many major winning models missing. Annoyingly, WRC 10 instantly makes one of WRC 9’s more irksome missteps, which is demanding that everybody begins the career mode in either the WRC Junior or WRC 3 series, with no way for those of us who’ve done a few laps already to skip past these feeder series and get straight into the main WRC championship. I get that climbing the motorsport ladder is a natural part of a career mode process, but it just feels a little punitive to make the faithful redo it every year. I suspect I would’ve had more patience for it had WRC 10 let me dive straight into the new Private team career option, which lets you build your own race team and buy and design your own team car with the welcome new livery editor, but KT Racing has locked the most interesting new element of WRC 10’s career mode behind the completion of Anniversary mode, which I don’t get. On top of that, the baffling bonus objectives have survived another iteration without being kicked to the curb, meaning you’ll still need to put up with your manufacturer suggesting daft things like “don’t use hard tyres for this rally”, which slightly undermines the interesting new tyre strategy layer KT Racing has inserted this time around. Not only must we choose a stockpile of tyre types to take into each rally, but tyres can even be cross-mounted if you want to experiment and potentially discover some extra speed on drastically mixed surface stages. Opting to complete the new shakedown before each rally will give you four additional tyres in your stash. Tyre strategy becomes very important if you opt for the new realistic rally length, which better resembles real WRC rallies (which, in real life, are generally run over hundreds of kilometres). You can name your co-driver this year, which is a fun touch, and KT Racing has added both an English-language female co-driver and a range of extra co-driver chatter for a bit more flavour out on stages. They probably could’ve done with a wider range of comments because they get repetitive quickly, and they’re not always correct, but I quite admire WRC 10’s ability to get a rise out of me. If you find it irritating, the so-called immersive voice can be toggled off. There’s definitely been work on car audio this year, too; all the components and layers are there from WRC 9 but it sounds denser and I’ve encountered none of the volume bugs I ran into in WRC 9. WRC 10 includes the new Estonian and Croatian rallies, but there are a few rallies missing from the roster. The last-minute Arctic Rally won’t be featured (the cancelled Rally Sweden remains in WRC 10 in its place) but KT Racing has explained that Belgium and modern Greek stages will follow after launch. I think Estonia is the highlight of the new rallies so far, with its fast, skinny stages and lush and gorgeous colour palette. Slower speeds expose some of WRC 10’s intermittent visual weaknesses, like squared-off curves and some occasionally plain trackside props, but it’s otherwise a very handsome racing game. Things look especially nice when low sun pierces the thick tree lines, and night stages look excellent. Gravel rallies like Estonia are still my preference; I prefer them over tarmac rallies as it’s the type of looser driving I enjoy. There have been some changes to the handling this year and I find the better sense of consistent momentum while sliding cars on the throttle quite satisfying. It also feels more challenging to make very small steering adjustments at high speed, meaning I really have to finesse the car on straights. It does quite a good job of letting you know when you have the wrong tyres on, and the change in grip across surfaces seems more noticeable than ever. I think wheel feedback this year is probably the best it’s been, but I’m still faster on a controller. KT Racing’s stage design remains fabulous, although it’s a shame so much of its excellent work from WRC 8 and WRC 9 has been dropped thanks to calendar changes. There is actually a bonus tab for other rallies, which I excitedly thought may have been KT Racing’s way of including rallies from the last couple of games that aren’t being run in 2021 – like Poland, Germany, Mexico, Turkey, or Australia – but the tab is inaccessible so instead I’m just confused. WRC 10 is a great rally game and a lovely, if a fraction flawed, ode to the… 49-year history of the World Rally Championship. The end result isn’t streets ahead of the already impressive WRC 9 – and it’s still making some of the latter’s minor mistakes – but WRC 10 is another successful example of KT Racing’s commitment to fantastic stage design and frantic, fast-paced, and occasionally unforgiving fun. "
212,King's Bounty 2 ,6.0,"King's Bounty 2 is a tired sigh of a Euro-style tactical RPG. Not the kind you make when you're frustrated or relieved, though; it's more like when you sit down after walking up a long flight of stairs and feel sort of distantly content. For the most part, it's fine. The tactical combat is actually pretty enjoyable, the music is great, and the world looks nice. But it feels janky and unpolished in a lot of technical aspects, and the mediocre storytelling rarely got me motivated to see how the next step of the adventure might unfold. In a lot of ways, this long-overdue sequel is comparable to RPGs like ELEX or The Technomancer: a mid-budget contender that really wants to be something like a blockbuster BioWare game but doesn't really have the resources or the expertise to get there. King’s Bounty 2 is a bit less ambitious than either of those other two, and probably the better for it – it doesn’t try to do anything wild and sticks to the fundamentals. But from the general glitchiness of the camera to the phoned-in story cutscenes, I still got the sense that the developers at 1C bit off more than they could chew.  The voice acting, for one thing, is very inconsistent. The sorceress Katherine, one of the three playable characters and the one I spent the most time with over 40 hours of adventuring, has a pleasing timbre with a haughty, aristocratic delivery. But some of the random NPCs scattered throughout the world sound more like they’d just grabbed someone who hadn't been in front of a mic before and handed them a script, if the distractingly bad performances are anything to go by. And those moments detract from the worldbuilding. Characters are introduced very abruptly, just like everything else in the story, and you're sent ping-ponging from one clue to the next with little room for anybody to develop relationships with others, much less as individuals. There were a couple of surprises that felt worth the wait, but in general the motives of the various leaders and factions were always presented with so little nuance that nothing that happened left much of an emotional impact. It feels very by-the-numbers, like all of the heart went into building out the setting and very little into the cast and story. That's a bit of a shame, because the fantasy world 1C has put together is pretty slick for a project this size. The graphics are a bit dated-looking, especially with the lighting, creature animations, and some of the faces. Compared to even a six-year-old game like The Witcher 3, it comes up short. However, they've gone with an art direction that's just stylized enough it didn't bother me all that often. Zooming in on individual units reveals a lot of depth and detail, especially on some of the bigger monsters, and I particularly liked how increasing a squad's veterancy would spiff up their equipment visually as well. While large portions of the map can feel a bit samey – a lot of it is just hilly green woodland – it's also packed with little lore tidbits like discarded notes and history tomes that were entertaining to paw through. If only getting around weren't such a huge pain. Your default run speed is just slow enough to be thoroughly irritating from the first moment to the last, and for some reason there's a walk button but no sprint. Why anyone would want to move through this sprawling country even slower than you move by default sure beats me. You do get a horse fairly early on, but it has clunky controls, it's restricted to walking speed in larger towns, and it has a lengthy animation to get on and off that freezes you in place. That never ceased to be frustrating. What saves King's Bounty 2's bacon is the turn-based tactical battles. Granted, there are some unpleasant difficulty spikes, especially if you're playing a magic build in the early game. But they're actually pretty good fights once you get into the swing of things. You take an army of up to five units into each one, with dozens of choices from human knights, to gruesome undead, to deadly mythical beasts that result in practically endless interesting compositions. They're divided into four factions of Order, Anarchy, Power, and Finesse, and normally you'll want to stick to one to get the best synergies – but there are ways to build your character to be more faction-agnostic, at the cost of not being able to focus on beefing up one faction to their max potential. While King's Bounty has some issues, there's a lot to like about the game. It's a familiar, yet refreshing RPG hybrid. You're going to spend a lot of time with the combat system and that's a good thing because it's simple, intuitive and filled with strategy and depth. The fighting requires players to adapt to the situation, and will constantly keep gamers on their toes. Yes, the difficulty can be very unbalanced at times, and sure the tutorial needs work, but as it stands, King's Bounty is a great game for all types of RPG fans. The talent tree has an interesting twist to it as well, in that higher-level talents are tied to ethical decisions you'll make in both the main story and side quests. To unlock the most powerful magic spells, for instance, you'll have to choose Finesse over Power when given multiple ways to complete a mission. It turns out, though, that this is a better idea in theory than in practice. Finesse options tend to be the better choice in almost all cases unless you really want to put yourself in unnecessary danger for the sake of a challenge, and Anarchy vs Order typically ends up boiling down to moustache-twirling bad guy versus righteous hero. I would have liked to see a bit more complexity and nuance that could have led to more difficult decisions. Where this got a bit awkward is when I realized that there are only a finite number of battles, and a finite amount of treasure, throughout the entire world. That means you can't grind out weaker enemies for experience and better gear if you're stuck, so some sections felt like I was running around from side quest to side quest looking for a fight that I could actually win with my current power. It also means you can technically get a “game over” by losing all of your units and not having the money to replace them. King's Bounty 2 lets you save anywhere at any time, so this is more of a theoretical issue. But it's also kind of a poster child for the handful of awkward design decisions that just don't seem well thought-out. The feeling I keep coming back to with King's Bounty 2 is simply that it's fine. And sometimes that bugs me more than if it were really flawed or broken in some kind of interesting way. The tactical battles punch above their weight, and I might have felt better about it if that's all there was: a series of interesting combat encounters with maybe a bit of flavor text and some shop menus in between. But all the plodding around to get to the good stuff is mostly a drag, and I couldn't muster any enthusiasm for the story even when I was trying my hardest. I wouldn't warn anyone away from checking it out if you're really interested, but I wouldn't advise you to go out of your way for it either. "
213,Sonic Colors: Ultimate ,8.0,"Originally released back in 2010 for the Wii, Sonic Colors marked a return to form for the Blue Blur. It righted the ship of Sonic’s 3D missteps by focusing entirely on what makes the series fun: feeling like you are the fastest thing alive. Sonic Colors: Ultimate is that same game, remastered for modern platforms with improved lighting, 4K/60 FPS support (except on Switch, of course), a remixed soundtrack, and a couple of other minor gameplay additions. None of these upgrades make Sonic Colors: Ultimate a must-buy for returning fans, but for anyone who missed it due to being put off by the likes of Sonic 06 and Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 1, it’s still good enough that this trip to Eggman’s Interstellar Amusement Park is already an easy recommendation. Regardless of whether you’ve played before, the story of Sonic Colors won’t be a surprise to anyone: Eggman is up to no good, seeking to harness the power of alien energy to fuel a mind-control weapon, and it's up to Sonic and Tails to stop him. The plot obviously isn’t what anyone’s here for, but it’s at least well acted and sprinkled with a few chuckles here and there – especially thanks to Cubot and Orbot, Eggman’s two robot henchmen, who have their own little running gag of Cubot’s voice chip constantly getting damaged and replaced, much to the chagrin of Eggman.   What is important about the story, however, is that it introduces the Wisps, the small multicolored aliens that Eggman is hunting down. These Wisps are the main thing that separate Sonic Colors from every other mainline console Sonic game, both past and present. Think of them as transformation power-ups along the lines of what you’d find in a Mario game, only you get to choose when to activate their powers. Pink Wisps can turn you into a Spike Ball that allows you to cling to walls, yellow Wisps turn you into a drill that can dig underground, and teal Wisps turn you into a laser that can bounce off prisms and travel at the speed of light. They’re unlocked as you progress through Sonic Colors, but you can always revisit old levels and replay them with Wisps that you unlocked later on to access new paths, which is something that we’ll circle back to. There are a total of nine Wisps that you can unlock over the course of Sonic Colors: Ultimate – including a brand-new Ghost Wisp that wasn’t in the original game – and they primarily enhance the two things that are key to a great Sonic game: your speed (duh), and the multiple paths that allow you to find your own way through a level. A pink Wisp might give you the opportunity to completely bypass a slow platforming section by zipping up a wall, a Drill Wisp might lead you to a subterranean path that’s way faster than the one above ground, and a Laser Wisp can instantly shoot you across a section lined with enemies, taking them all out at the literal speed of light. These particular wisps do a great job of varying up the level design without ever slowing Sonic down. Then there are Wisps more geared toward secret collecting, light-puzzle solving, and platforming. While these are certainly less exciting than the ones built around speed, they still make exploration and revisiting levels with new powers a lot of fun, as they can help you discover new paths that dramatically change the flow of a level, and even help you improve your time or score. The new Ghost Wisp is probably the weakest of the bunch, as it’s really only used to mix up the locations of some hidden Red Rings compared to where they were in the original game. With it, you can float through walls by pulling yourself to an anchor point, and... that’s about it. Unlike the other Wisp powers, it’s never really used in any sort of clever or satisfying way. The one downside to the Wisps is that, because they’re drip fed to you one at a time over the course of the whole game, the first time through the early levels of Sonic Colors isn’t nearly as fun as they are when you’re able to replay them with all the Wisps unlocked. This causes the first few hours to be kind of a drag because you’re often forced along paths that are slow and tedious. That’s an issue that carries over from the original, but one that Sonic Colors: Ultimate introduces for the first time is related to its remixed soundtrack. The first three levels of any world play a newly remixed theme and the last three levels play the original versions. The bummer is that there’s no way to choose which version you want to hear, which sucks because I’ve found that most of the original themes are far superior to the overly produced remixes. The soundtrack is still great all around, don’t get me wrong, but it seems strange to have both versions and not give you the option of selecting which one you want to hear on a given level. The other big gameplay addition is a Rival Rush mode that lets you race against Metal Sonic in what is essentially just a dressed-up time trial. It’s a fun way to challenge yourself to beat a level quickly, but it feels like it should be something you can do on every level instead of there just being one per world, a total of just six races all together. Cosmetic items were also added in this remaster, giving you the ability to customize Sonic’s shoes, gloves, aura, and boost effect by spending a new currency that you can collect throughout each level. None of them are particularly noteworthy though – it’s just some straight recolors, simple visual effects, and tacky patterns. I found myself sticking with the classic look. On the graphical side of things, Sonic Colors: Ultimate holds up reasonably well for a nearly 11-year-old Wii game. The one sour spot is the cutscenes, which were not redone and are super low-res on a modern screen. But the actual gameplay runs at a steady 60fps in 4K on the PlayStation 5, and there are some nice improvements made to the lighting and character models. Most importantly, Sonic Colors: Ultimate benefits from having been a gorgeous game to begin with. Its levels are among the most imaginative the series has ever seen, from the Rainbow Road-esque Starlight Carnival that has Sonic speeding through space while an intergalactic war plays out in the background, to the dreamlike Sweet Mountain that’s made entirely of junk food. Every world is beaming with creativity and the unifying theme of it all being part of an amusement park is just icing on the cake. As a remaster, Sonic Colors: Ultimate throws in a decent amount of new stuff, but nothing beyond the frame rate and resolution bump really add up to anything that elevates the experience beyond what it was on the Wii. That said, it was already great in 2010, and still holds up as one of the best modern Sonic games to date thanks to its imaginative level designs, a laser focus on the things that make the series fun, and the addition of power granting Wisps that add a ton of variety to each level without compromising the speed that should define a Sonic game. "
214,Psychonauts 2 ,8.0,"It may have been 16 years since the first Psychonauts came out for us, but for Raz and his friends it’s only been a couple days. Psychonauts 2 picks up right where the 2005 original (and 2017 VR follow-up The Rhombus of Ruin) left off, and it does so in a way that feels fresh and modern while still maintaining everything that made its predecessor so special – from its strange but lovable characters to the fantastical mental worlds inside their heads. Sure, it’s brought a little bit of that clunky mid-2000s platforming along with it too, but even with a few rough edges Psychonauts 2 is pretty much everything I could have hoped for from this long-awaited sequel. Those who understandably haven’t played a 16-year old platformer and its short VR-exclusive follow-up will have to get caught up through a charming animated recap at the start of this new adventure. It does an entertaining job of providing the important info needed to make Psychonauts 2 work well enough as a standalone story, one that explores both Raz’s family and the history of the Psychonauts as a whole far more than the specific events of Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp. That said, this sequel is also littered with important callbacks, exciting character reunions, fun Easter eggs, and a whole lot of juicy backstory that made it all hit harder for me as a long-time fan.  Picking up just the day after Rhombus of Ruin (itself set only a day after Psychonauts), your newly deputized 10-year-old hero Razputin Aquato arrives at the Motherlobe, the headquarters of the psychic spy organization known as the Psychonauts, to learn he hasn't actually been made a full agent, just an intern. As such, he’s got some more training to do to truly earn his stripes, this time while running around the facilities of the Motherlobe and the wooded area surrounding it. Of course, as with the first game (and without any spoilers), things quickly escalate from there into an excellent story that’s simultaneously high-stakes and deeply personal. Developer Double Fine has done a phenomenal job of expanding the Psychonauts universe while recapturing that signature “psychic James Bond goes to summer camp” vibe of the original. You may start off in a high-tech spy base, but it isn’t long before you’re allowed outside and given free reign to roam its lakeside exterior, hidden caves, and a nearby campground full of gorgeously stylized redwood trees. That outdoor openness means Psychonauts 2 still offers a heaping helping of Whispering Rock’s folksy feel alongside the fancier interior of the Motherlobe, but it never relies on references or nostalgia alone to impress either. And of course, all these locations are still dotted with collectibles to find, tricky side tasks to hunt down (including another item scavenger hunt), and amusing characters to talk to. The original’s cast of quirky campers is replaced by three slightly smaller groups here: the adult agents of the Psychonauts, the charismatic teenage members of the intern program that eventually become Raz’s friends, and the entire Aquato family camping out in the nearby woods. Every single character in Psychonauts 2 is delightfully unique, incredibly well-written and voiced, and just an absolute joy to get to know. The facial animations can occasionally look awkward and stiff outside of the more tailored cutscenes, but it’s hard to overstate how fun it is to simply explore these platforming playgrounds and talk to people. The Aquato family, in particular, is a true highlight of this sequel, giving Raz far more depth and shining a different light on the events of the first game. The fact that Raz abandoned them to join the Psychonauts isn’t really addressed much in the original, but here you get to learn how each of his relatives feel about what happened. That could be his loving mother Donatella, who is just glad he’s safe, his older brother Dion, still bitter that Raz left them (which is fair, given it’s only been a few days), or his older sister Frazie, herself struggling with a secret spurred by his departure. Meeting all these characters and completing small activities like setting up the family circus tent with them is a treat, and the same can be said for just about everyone else Raz meets. The real world is only half what you get to explore, however, and Psychonauts 2 manages to deliver both physically and mentally. While you aren’t diving into every brain you see (that would be rude), the real meat of the platforming and combat takes place inside the psychic worlds of many of the more troubled characters you meet. And much like the people who house them, those brains and the reflections of their owners' psyche that they represent are wonderfully creative and consistently surprising across the board. Levels tend to follow a bit of a formulaic structure, with most revolving around getting three of some MacGuffin before reaching a flashy boss fight with a similar three-hit pattern. That would hurt their novelty if it weren’t for the fact that their awesome art styles, top-notch music, and diverse gameplay mechanics are so different that each one is still a refreshing delight. One moment you might be playing life-size pachinko in a neon hospital casino, while the next you’re cooking anthropomorphic food in a timed gameshow, and after that you’re entering a library book and running across its words in 2D. There isn’t really a bad world among the roughly dozen or so you’ll explore, with a particular standout being a psychedelic music-themed stage where you’re accompanied by a hilarious ball of light voiced by Jack Black. These worlds also distinguish themselves from the originals’ mental levels by tying more directly into the story across the board. I might remember Psychonauts’s Milk Man and Bonaparte board game stages fondly, but completing those ultimately meant little more than opening a door, story-wise. In contrast, every single one of Psychonauts 2’s levels are tied not just into the psyche of their host character, but to the plot as a whole. Early on, Raz is even forced to reckon with the responsibility of being able to enter someone’s mind and change their mental state, an important conversation that the first game never really had. Moments like this got me more invested in every stage, even the goofier among them. Both the platforming and combat have also been expanded to be deeper than those of its predecessor, and all of Raz’s animations are brimming with personality. Moving, jumping, and attacking are generally responsive and satisfying, but they can also be a little clunky at times. That might mean classic 3D platforming issues, like not quite knowing if you’ll grab that bar you’re jumping for, or little fighting idiosyncrasies such as enemies not always always responding to attacks like you'd expect. None of these irritations are so bad that I ever stopped having fun, especially since checkpoints are largely forgiving when something does go unexpectedly wrong, but Psychonauts 2 definitely doesn’t have quite the same level of polish as a fellow 2021 action-platformer like Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, either. That all said, both the mental and real worlds are flush with creative jungle gyms to hop your way around. In classic Psychonauts fashion, they’re full of trapeze bars to swing from, trampolines to jump on, and rails to grind – and those are all fun to navigate whether you’re in the treetops of the real world or over the dream-like swamp of someone’s psyche. While most of the mental levels are fairly linear, Psychonauts 2 also loosens the reins occasionally too, presenting multiple paths or problems and letting you decide which order to tackle them (or potentially which to ignore, if you’re more interested in hunting for its plentiful secrets first). Combat itself is a mix of mashy brawling and more nuanced strategy, depending on the enemies in front of you. This sequel does a great job of expanding the roster of enemies you’ll face, quickly growing past the original’s Censor baddies with flying Regrets that can be shot out the sky, goopy Doubts that will muck up your movement and need to be burned, lightning-fast Panic Attacks that have to be slowed down to be hit, and plenty more. Dodging and spamming attacks can still be effective at times, but I like that most mental adversaries have a specific ability designed to answer them, pushing me to be nimble on the battlefield and constantly swap my strategies depending on what I was fighting. It’s not trying to be Devil May Cry or anything, but that ever-increasing variety throughout the campaign certainly kept combat entertaining. However, that need to change up your attacks frequently also makes one small shortcoming that tagged along from the original a little more obvious: only being able to equip four of your eventual eight psychic abilities at once, one of which is the all but essential Levitation that you’ll frequently use to sprint and hover-jump. It’s silly that Levitation isn’t always accessible, feeling less like swapping weapons in other games and more like if your basic punch took up an ability slot too. It’s not hard to pause time and change abilities on the fly, but that can get a little obnoxious in the later encounters that cleverly throw multiple enemy types at you at once. The abilities are all good fun to use at least, with returning powers like Telekinesis being made into a more practical combat tool and impressive new options replacing the less interesting ones of the original. One of my favorite new additions was the Mental Connection ability that lets you hop between points in the air while platforming or pull enemies toward you in combat, as well as the Archetype power that creates an adorable paper version of Raz to assist him. (A cute Easter egg with the Archetype being its voice, provided by Rikki Simons to compliment Raz’s already top-notch performance from Richard Horvitz, a duo that played a similar pair as Gir and Zim, respectively, in the Nickelodeon cartoon show Invader Zim.) Psychonauts 2 also deepens character progression in interesting but slightly uneven ways. Increasing Raz's rank by grabbing certain collectibles will provide points you can use to improve his abilities permanently, while the Psitanium currency can be spent on equippable pins to modify them further. The rank upgrades offer a nice bit of simple but satisfying personalization to how you level Raz, giving you control of the order you unlock extras like a dodge attack for your punches or a charge shot for your PSI Blast. Meanwhile pins can grant either sillier or more unique effects, from altering the color of your Levitation ball to changing your PSI Blast from raw damage to a stun effect… assuming you can afford the ones you want. Simply put, the economy here is a little bit out of whack. You get Psitanium slowly (and trust me, I was trying to collect it), and have to pay to upgrade how much of it you can hold, pay for pricey healing items, and constantly pay for PSI Cores to actually use the rank-increasing PSI cards you find. You can only equip three pins at a time, too, but I couldn’t afford the three pins I really wanted until pretty much the very end of the story anyway. It also feels odd that those three slots are shared between practical pins that can do things like up your damage and jokier options like making Raz dance while standing still. There are certainly cool customization choices scattered throughout this system, I just wish it were more generous so I could have taken advantage of that variety sooner. Thankfully, the door is left wide open for the completionists who want to buy every single pin or find every last secret in a world covered in them. While completing most of the side activities and hunting down collectibles to a degree I would call “thorough but not obsessive,” it took me roughly 13 hours to reach the credits – and I still have more to find. Without spoilers, you’re given the freedom to finish up anything you might have missed after completing the main story, and some entertaining new conversations even open up with a few characters. That meant the first thing I wanted to do after beating Psychonauts 2 was keep playing. Psychonauts 2’s weird and wonderfully written story is full of interesting, nuanced characters that I instantly fell in love with. Most of its fresh ideas go a long way toward elevating the Psychonauts formula into the modern era, though its enticing new equippable pin system can be a little too stingy. Double Fine has also done a great job of expanding this universe toward both grander and more intimate threats without losing the joyous childhood adventure vibes of the original. It may bring a bit of that mid-2000s action-platformer clunkiness along with it, but Psychonauts 2 is still just about everything I could have hoped for from a sequel to one of my favorite games. "
215,Ghost of Tsushima: Iki Island DLC ,9.0,"a href=""/ghost-of-tsushima-ps4/38070/review/ghost-of-tsushima-review"">Ghost of Tsushima was an amazing game when it came out a year ago, with a meaty campaign, stellar samurai combat, and arguably one of the most gorgeous open worlds ever created. This Iki Island expansion is its first paid DLC, which is also included as part of the new Director’s Cut, and it delivers a brand-new island, a new story chapter, new sidequests, and a healthy heap of new secrets and collectibles to discover. And while none of it goes any further than just “more Ghost of Tsushima,” in my book, more Ghost of Tsushima is always a great thing. In order to play the Iki Island content, you’ll need to progress to at least Act 2 of the main campaign (you can also circle back and do it after beating the story).  That’s when Jin discovers that a group of Mongols, led by a woman named The Eagle, are planning an invasion of Tsushima from the neighboring Iki Island. Wanting to nip the invasion in the bud, Jin heads to Iki Island himself, which is a mostly lawless land inhabited primarily by bandits who are also suffering at the hands of The Eagle and her tribe.  Iki Island is a place of great significance to Jin because it’s the place where his father died, which makes the story deeply personal. We get to see Jin’s character explored to a degree far beyond what happens in the main campaign, which is great. There are certainly one or two head-scratching plot reveals that border on illogical, but all things considered, I enjoyed the tale of Iki Island and the way it forced Jin to reconcile with his past. But story aside, the best part about this expansion is the whole new island to explore. Once again you begin with a map that’s almost completely blank and are free to set out in any direction to discover its many landmarks, areas of interest, and some of the coolest Easter eggs I’ve seen in a while. Many of these landmarks are identical to the kind of thing found in the main campaign, like bamboo shoots, hot springs, lighthouses, and Haiku Spots, but there are plenty of entertaining new distractions to discover, too. That includes archery challenges, animal sanctuaries, playable flashbacks, and a handful of sidequests. Two new Mythic Tales are also awesome, and have especially worthwhile rewards – even to someone like me, who already had 100% completion in the base game. While the context of every quest varies, the content feels very familiar. You’ll infiltrate lots of Mongol camps (whether by stealth or standoff), follow footprints to track people and animals down, and charge through open fields for large-scale battles. It’s all well-trodden ground, since we’ve done these same types of quests before, just in different locations and for different characters, but a year later I was far enough removed that it was fun to do them again. The one way where Iki Island truly shakes things up is in its enemies. There’s a new type called the Shaman that is not only a formidable fighter, but will also buff all nearby enemies with their song and dance. In addition to that, there are now enemies that will switch up their weapons mid-fight. That means you might begin a fight in Water Stance to deal with an enemy that’s wielding a shield, but then have to swap to Stone Stance once they strap that shield to their back and pull out two swords. It sounds simple, but it can actually be a good challenge to juggle when you’re also worrying about the crowd of enemies surrounding you, all wielding different weapons. It’s just another layer to think about that makes combat even more enjoyable. Ghost of Tsushima is an enormous and densely packed samurai adventure that often left me completely awestruck with both its visual spectacle and excellent combat. By steadily introducing new abilities instead of stat upgrades, its swordplay manages to stay challenging, rewarding, and fun throughout the entire 40 to 50 hours that it took me to beat the campaign. A few aspects are surprisingly lacking in polish in comparison to other first-party Sony games, especially when it comes to enemy AI and the stealth part of its stealth/action split. Still this is an extraordinary open-world action-adventure game that solves several issues that have long gone unaddressed in the genre, while also just being an all around samurai slashin’ good time. It took me eight hours or so to get through the main storyline of Iki Island, even while taking my time and doing a healthy amount of exploration and outpost clearing to expose the map. I’ve since put in another four or five hours to clear out all the landmarks, and at this point I feel like I’ve generally experienced everything substantial this DLC has to offer, making it a small but relatively dense package.

216,Twelve Minutes ,8.0,"Twelve Minutes doesn’t seem all that unique on paper. When you boil it all down, it’s a fairly traditional point-and-click adventure game that takes place in one setting. But where things get interesting is that it’s also a time-loop mystery, so even though you have all of your puzzle objects at your disposal from the jump, they’ll need to be combined in intentionally different ways over the course of dozens and dozens of loop resets during the full six- to eight-hour story in order to unlock new information. It’s a fresh twist on a genre I’ve loved since the original Monkey Island days, and the story is good enough to make me immediately want to talk to someone else who’s also finished it.  Think of Twelve Minutes and its time loop as a house of cards: you can build it using anything in the deck, but if you make one mistake, it’ll collapse and you’ll have to start all over. Sometimes you’ll knock it down on purpose in order to get something you need for your next proper attempt to finish it. It’s also somewhat flexible: when I talked to two other people who played it, I found that each of us took a slightly different path to arrive at the conclusion. That story sees your character, voiced by James McAvoy, walking in the front door of your apartment at the beginning of the game, where your wife, played by Daisy Ridley, is eager to share some news. She greets you and offers a dessert she made. A few minutes later, though, a cop voiced by Willem Dafoe knocks on the door claiming to have a warrant for your wife’s arrest; one wrong move and things go awry fast and the loop starts over. You also can’t leave the apartment, as doing so also resets the loop. That confinement sometimes felt comforting as I tried to figure out what to do next and discover why this cop was so hostile, since I knew the answer was in the room somewhere – there were no other locations I could’ve missed something in. But of course, if you do get stuck (which I did once until I stumbled onto a new path by accident), that same one-bedroom flat can feel frustrating too. Things can get Groundhog Day-levels of dark if you want them to, and it’ll be up to you to see if those are just clever ways you’re allowed to take out frustration when you get stuck, or if they can be used as legitimate ways to move the story forward. Of course, you’ve got items scattered around the apartment you can pick up, use, and combine with other objects: things like coffee mugs, a kitchen knife, spoons, the aforementioned desserts, and your cell phone, just to name a few. You can pick any of them up and they’ll be added to your inventory in classic point-and-click adventure style, and figuring out how – and when – to deploy them is key to advancing the plot. The small but star-studded voice cast does a great job of bringing the story to life, and Dafoe is particularly menacing as the cop. There’s also a subtle, drama-enhancing score that complements key moments nicely. Also, the ability to fast-forward through dialogue you’ve already heard many times in previous loops is invaluable for keeping things from getting too repetitive. Visually, meanwhile, Twelve Minutes is very simplistic, and eight hours is a long time to be looking at the same top-down view of your apartment. The frequent clipping issues and very rudimentary Sims-like animations don’t help, but it’s the kind of nitpick I learned to live with as I became engrossed in the central mystery. And that mystery absolutely pays off. Writer-director Luis Antonio deftly paces the peeling of the story’s onion layers; I was surprised when Steam showed that I’d played for seven and a half hours on my initial run-through; it didn’t feel that long, and I mean that in a good way. It’s difficult to convey my enthusiasm for Twelve Minutes’ time-loop mystery without discussing what happens at the end, but like Inside, I’d be doing you a grave disservice by giving anything away. What I can say is that the payoff is worth it, and the clever way in which writer-director Luis Antonio flips the traditional point-and-click adventure on its head makes for a compelling bit of unconventional storytelling that could only have worked as a game. Throw in great performances from three respected actors and the result is a memorable crime worth solving. "
217,Humankind ,7.0,"I don't want to spend an entire review comparing Humankind to Sid Meier's Civilization, but it's very clear that this is Amplitude's riff on that classic 4X melody. While I was delighted by some genuine improvements and innovations on my turn-based march from the Stone Age to the Space Age, most of the basics felt pretty familiar. And more than once, that left me wishing it had pushed the boundaries a bit more, like the studio's previous Endless Space and Endless Legend games did. One of my favorite little new ideas in Humankind is the Neolithic Era, which starts each run with a small band of nomadic hunter-gatherers who have to collect enough food or science to advance and become a settled society. I enjoyed this unorthodox playstyle so much that I wished I could have spent more time with it, or even remained nomadic. But you eventually settle into a more traditional 4X routine of expanding cities through districts to collect food, science, production, and cash, against up to nine other AI or human-controlled empires.  There are two new resources that mix things up a little. Influence limits how much you can expand externally and spreads your culture to neighboring cities, while stability limits how much you can expand internally, as urban centers that sprawl out further and further become more difficult to govern. These considerations made planning out my empire's path to prosperity an interesting and often challenging puzzle. As a chill tile-painting game in which I can watch my civilization spread across the gorgeous world map, Humankind stands up well against its competition. Influence is also used quite a bit in the diplomacy system, and this is probably the cleverest idea Humankind brings to the genre. You can just declare war out of nowhere, but doing so gives a large bonus to your enemy's war support, which is a measure of how enthusiastic their people are to fight you. If you instead spread your religion or culture to one of their cities, you can gain a grievance against them for ""oppressing"" your people, which will slowly tick up your side's war support over time. So to truly be a successful conqueror, you need to be exporting your gods and your top radio hits, not just have the biggest army. As neat as this system is, it didn't put a lot of pressure on me unless I went looking for a fight. Even on the higher difficulties, I never had a war declared on me even once over the course of three campaigns. That included when I had a very small army that couldn't have stood up to my neighbors if they’d come knocking. And the Independent People who sometimes gave me trouble were all too easy to pacify with money or influence compared to Civ's sometimes nasty barbarians. It's altogether too trivial to keep everyone happy by making trade agreements, paying bribes, and forgiving your grievances against them. And while Humankind's battle system has a nice pacing to it, since multiple battle turns can take place within a single world turn, the AI is consistently disappointing. They'll often spread their attacks out over multiple units and then get obliterated when they could have focus-fired and at least cost me a unit on the way out. Not that Civ’s AI is exactly legendary, but the recent Old World showed us that this can be done a lot better. The wars I fought were full of interesting tactical considerations thanks to how much things like terrain and line of sight factor into each engagement, but the fact that I rarely felt like defeat was a possibility made my victories feel rote rather than triumphant. And while the zoomed-in 3D map looks fantastic, Amplitude has tried to go the route of replacing map overlays with a system that gives you different information the further you scroll out. The problem is that both of the higher-level ones look atrocious and you can't turn them off. The mid-level zoom view is a soul-crushing gray void that doesn't give me any useful info I couldn't get on the 3D map, and I'd enjoy Humankind more if they just removed it entirely. And the top-level view, which is at least useful for seeing political boundaries, looks like disorienting neon vomit and gives me a headache. I hate looking at them, and I hate that they hide the rather attractive and realistic terrain and cities. I would compare it directly to Crusader Kings 3, which uses a very similar system, but each of its zoom levels has a clear job and looks great doing it. The other headline feature is that you'll be choosing a different culture for every era, rather than one that sticks with you through the ages. I really liked this on a mechanical level. For one thing, it means you have a unique unit every era, instead of only for a small part of each campaign. The design of these units and bonuses felt very safe, though. There's nothing as wild or game-changing as some of the more out there civ and leader abilities in Civ 5 and 6, and they typically just provide new ways to generate resources. However, since cultures all have niches like Expansionist or Scientist, you can focus on a different playstyle every era, which is nice in a long campaign where you might get bored of being type-cast as a warlord or a brainiac. And that won't hamstring you, since victory is based on a Fame system that adds up all of your deeds, from conquest to building the biggest cities. There is a religion system, but only just. Like the era bonuses for each culture, the bonuses you can add to your faith are mostly simple modifiers to resource generation or modest military buffs. Religion only spreads passively, and unless I was looking for a reason to go to war, I usually forgot it existed. There is a kind of interesting late-game wrinkle in that you can pursue tolerant secularism or militant state atheism, modeling changing ideas about the nature of the universe. The problem is, while this is cool for roleplaying and can generate new conflicts in the case of atheism, it felt like taking away some of my toys since neither of these belief systems get anything to replace holy sites or tenet bonuses. The culture system also doesn't exactly solve the roleplaying problem of telling a coherent, historical story like I’d hoped it might. Sure, we could say my Khmer realm was conquered by the Ming Empire when I chose them as my next culture, but where did these Chinese bureaucrats come from? Were they hiding in the forest? Outer space? They weren't on the map anywhere before I decided to play as them. This is of course, no siller than Civ's version of this same problem where you have American tribesmen founding the city of Washington D.C. in 4,000 BCE. But it's not necessarily a lot more logical, either. I was also fairly disappointed with the late game. There is an event chain related to climate change, but in my games it only cost what was at that point less than one turn's worth of income to avoid any consequences at all. And even ignoring it completely only gives you a -30 to all resource production in your cities for 10 turns, which isn’t much by the time it comes up. The map doesn't even change to reflect rising sea levels or growing deserts. Similarly, there is a Pollution mechanic that kicks in once coal becomes available, but hell if I know what it does. The tooltip doesn't explain it. There's no encyclopedia entry about it. And even when I was trying to produce as much of it as possible in my Soviet run to find out, it never got above ""Level 0"" or had any effect on anything. Downplaying the climate crisis in any game about humanity's near future is not only factually incorrect – it's also really boring game design, giving up on the chance to mix things up and introduce new challenges at a point when you're probably just taking victory laps. That being said, these narrative events are a nice touch throughout the other ages. They might ask you whether you allow priests of both genders or only one, or if your monarchy should be absolute or constitutional. These decisions will move you along ideological axes like Liberty vs Authority and Tradition vs Progress. Just like the cultures, though, the bonuses for doing so seem like very small tweaks to resource generation most of the time. I didn't get the sense that being Collectivist vs Individualist greatly transformed my society or allowed me to roleplay in any very meaningful ways. And while your ideological distance from another empire is supposed to generate diplomatic tension, the sheepishness of the AI to declare war meant this never really affected me much at all. I also can't go without mentioning some bugs and performance issues. Especially if I tabbed out of the game and back in, I would often have issues like the wagons and semi trucks travelling along my roads starting to flicker in and out of existence until I did a clean restart of the program. More rarely, audio would start to skip and become garbled. And worst of all, in one of my campaigns, I hit a point where ending the turn would simply hang forever and not allow me to continue. Amplitude is apparently aware of this last issue and told me they plan to fix it in the day one patch, but the workaround they provided me didn't prove useful and I had to abandon that run. I don't dislike Humankind – far from it. But as the sun sets on my attractive empire, I'm not that impressed with it either. It certainly has some strong ideas, and the diplomacy system, at least in theory, is excellent. I loved the flexibility of being able to specialize in something different with each new culture I adopted. But especially against the passive and tactically inept AI, I kept feeling like I'd rather be playing Civ 4, or Civ 5, or Civ 6. To be fair, if this were a Civilization game, that would almost be expected – they've each come out in a state that was a bit underwhelming compared to where their predecessors ended up after multiple expansions. And maybe with time and DLC, Humankind will stand alongside the best of them as well. For now, it's an intriguing, though not always excelling, offshoot of a time-tested formula that succeeds at making me want to keep clicking one more turn… "
218,Boyfriend Dungeon ,6.0,"When I first heard the delightfully wild concept of Boyfriend Dungeon, I was keenly interested in the idea of playing a game that gives the dating sim formula a different kind of action: Hades-style isometric battles in which your weapons are also your love interests. That’s an exciting concept because games in this genre are often defined by romances that are longer and more choice-based than what you'll find in something like Mass Effect. But while the combat is entertaining enough while the enemy variety lasts and Boyfriend Dungeon certainly has a cast of pleasantly designed characters, it fails to offer much nuance in its relationships. Even worse, its roguelite structure tied to romance systems meant juggling spending time with who you like versus the weapon you actually want to play with. Limited dungeons, having to interact with an antagonist in an uncomfortably close way, and an awkwardly rushed romance system kill the mood, too. In Boyfriend Dungeon, you assume the role of a person who's never been on a date before and is sent to a cute beachside town for the summer to find love. It turns out the dating hot spots are on the beach or in the town's nightlife, but excitingly, they're in ""dunj"" or (what the cool folks here call dungeons) where people can go dungeon crawling for money — and romance. You're not dungeon crawling alongside another fighter, but are instead wielding potential partners and using them to slice or bash enemies into submission. In Boyfriend Dungeon, some people can magically transform into a cool weapon that reflects their personality: a cautious and artistic woman named Valeria can transform into a pretty dagger, while a K-pop idol morphs into an awesome lasersaber. Wielding someone isn't inherently romantic, but these weapon-people aren't hesitant about getting flirtatious.   It's a fun setup, though some moments in the romantic journey get a little bumpy given how inconsistent your character is with their available dialogue options. They go from not even being able to say they can stand up for themself in one instance to suddenly navigating rather intensely flirtatious situations. Talk about whiplash! More divergent dialogue options would have made more sense and let us consistently roleplay as either the naive romantic novice or the suave natural — or maybe even a character who had a shred of dating experience. As it is, these romances escalate far too quickly; if I were in their very inexperienced shoes, the way they go about approaching their partners' problems and romantic gestures would only make sense if they had far more disastrous outcomes. Things get even weirder in the beach town when weapon-people start going missing, so naturally, you delve into the dunj only to find them and, of course, date them. By typical dating sim standards, romance is exceptionally quick and easy in Boyfriend Dungeon. Since they’re almost all in your debt for your heroic rescue efforts you’re not starting from the point of having to win anyone’s favor — you’re choosing who to reject, if you decide to deny anyone — so already we’re cutting right to the chase and skipping the introductory phase we see in games like Hatoful Boyfriend and Hakuoki. Every weapon-person has six levels of romance, each with a corresponding date encounter, which increase as you gain experience with the weapons in the dunj by slaying enemies. The first is a surface-level and often heavily flirtatious introduction; the second is where you choose if you’re keeping it friendly or going for a more intimate relationship — and you'll usually get another chance at the third level to romance if you denied their first advance. There’s just not enough time to get to know your date before having to decide to engage romantically. There are quick interactions with the weapon-people while exploring the dungeons at special rest spots, but their reactions don't change as your relationship grows. A cold character that warms up to you can suddenly be aloof when you get back to the rest spot in the dunj. It's fine, and they do provide some nice context for the characters' thoughts on random subjects, but they're not substitutes for more meaningful time with each character while first establishing a romance. The rules of when you have to choose romance aren't clear either, so I went along with being flirtatious with everyone at first out of worry I'd miss something. For others like me who prefer one romance at a time, it may be a bit overwhelming and uncomfortable to accidentally find yourself juggling romantic involvements with five of the seven weapon people. I was especially unhappy knowing certain characters I was romancing probably wouldn't be cool with me making lifelong plans with others, but there were never any consequences for those unfaithful actions. (Which is also disappointing – shouldn’t I be called out for my two-timing ways by the characters who would be uncomfortable with that?) There are options to soften the intensity of the relationship and occasionally disagree or go against something the character would like, but not a ton of opportunities in terms of moving back to friendship. After I found out a character was into a relationship style I personally didn’t vibe with, I found it basically impossible to say “thanks but no thanks.” I could ignore her, but that’d also mean sacrificing the resolution to her story – and growing her abilities as a weapon. Which brings us to yet another problem: your affection level is the same as the weapon’s level in their skill tree. Weapon level progress stops at each level up and requires you to go on the next outing with the weapon-person before you can start earning XP toward the next. Progressing through skill trees is important because it unlocks bonuses and abilities specific to each weapon, like chain lightning that bounces between more targets for the electric blade, or amping up bleed duration that damages enemies over time. I wanted those upgrades, especially for my favorite weapons, but I just wasn’t into some of them as characters. The weapon-people vary in their preferred kind of relationship (poly, casual, monogamous), and the quality of their stories and personalities varies, too. With the exception of one of the more grounded characters’ stories, those whose stories push the boundaries of realism had the most interesting arcs. Sure, they're all weapon-people, but that magical part of them rarely plays into their personal stories. An extra dash of magic like witchcraft and other fantastical themes definitely enhanced their tales. Though their stories were, to an extent, relatable (I helped someone cope with death and another learn how to live a healthier lifestyle), I also got to see how a cat juggled its life indoors and on the streets. (Yes, you can ""romance"" this cat and it's maybe the best of Boyfriend Dungeon’s storylines – which is a bit of commentary on dating in and of itself when you think about it.) The limited number of interactions cut short my enjoyment of their paths, but they were enjoyable all the same. Some, however, were less than fun. One individual basically boiled down to being defined by their poorness and basically couldn't do much for themself. You'd think someone in college would understand that cooking for yourself is a way to save money, yet this character was oddly oblivious to that. And yet again, I didn't feel I knew them as a person well enough to enjoy being able to help them out of their occasional unfortunate situations. Another had serious family issues that were awkwardly made to be intensely goofy. For instance, the man's father would berate him for simple things like texting or, I don't know, the quality of his water. I liked his story otherwise, but it was an inconsistent experience. Again, you can skip engaging with characters you don't enjoy, but that also means you skip growing them as a weapon. The antagonist is Eric, a guy your cousin actually sets you up with for your first date. Eric is unabashedly rude and judgemental, so it’s not unreasonable that regardless of how you choose to approach him, you’ll only be able to treat him with disdain after a certain point. The problem with him as the villain is how you’re forced to interact with him, which is the same way you interact with everyone else: you have to text him. And that gets weird, because shortly after your initial meeting, this guy goes out of his way to pester, stalk, and intimidate you. Even weirder, he owns a materials shop you can choose to go to too. I was made massively uncomfortable by responding to his creepy messages, so as soon as I realized I could just ignore him I did, and went about my character’s summer. Only after completing the dungeons and finishing three character paths did I realize that you can’t, actually, bypass his creepiness; if you don't answer the texts of an asshole, you don't get to finish the story. Yikes. This realization was genuinely off-putting for me. There is a warning at the beginning of Boyfriend Dungeon about potentially uncomfortable situations, but it didn’t say I’d have to take part in them. I know many may not have the same response to having to interact with someone who is actively trying to harm you, your friends, and others because of their romantic interest in you, but even still, the design fails there. Physical notes, additional challenges in the dunj, or myriad other threats would have been better than forcing us to give space — and by replying to Eric's messages and choosing to engage, that is giving space — in order for him to continue his gross ways. If it were me I’d just block him and be done with it. I might’ve felt differently if the ending put some kind of twist on things that made it make sense or had something to say about abusive relationships beyond ""it's bad,"" but no – the resolution with his story is frustrating and unsatisfying, too. It's a shame the dating structure and some large leaps in relationships are largely disappointing because there is actually a lot to like about Boyfriend Dungeon. The music everywhere is consistently great, with catchy original pop songs and fun weapon romance themes in the lyrics. It's a perfect mix for the unique kind of dungeon diving you'll do while still maintaining the fun beach town vibes. The character designs are nicely diverse, gender-inclusive, and of course, attractive (please just look at Seven and Valeria). Their weapon abilities are fun to learn, too. Each weapon has its own specialization: Rowan, the scythe, creates a black hole that draws enemies and eventually earns you a damage multiplier; Valeria, the dagger, is all about confusing enemies, letting you roll your way out of a sticky situation; Isaac, the estoc, grants a shield and parry ability. You can slightly tweak certain perks at select love levels, too. Again, they only go to level six, so their growth is limited. That said, I appreciate that the weapons offer different movement speeds too – the dagger, for instance, made me nimble while the scythe was slow and heavy.  The combination of the weapon variety plus the random challenges of the procedurally generated dungeon floors made me happy to return to them early on and try my hand at fighting my way through odd monsters like flip phones and old boxy TVs. Dunj monsters are manifestations of a person’s fears and, as one weapon in particular won’t shut up about while fighting, the first is about fear of change. So having monsters be designed as old technology that gradually becomes more monstrous as you descend makes a fair amount of sense. As you’d expect for a roguelite-style action game, it's easy to lose a run quickly early on. The only ways to leave a dungeon are by running out of health or by leaving through an elevator. Naturally, progression after each defeat or exit was made easier with XP spoils that went to my weapons and my character. With each run, I satisfyingly saw my HP increase and did noticeably more damage. I enjoyed learning each weapon and appreciated that I could change which weapon I had equipped between each floor. If I had maxed out a weapon's level and needed to go on a date to move on, I could then switch to another and work on their level. That said, there are only about 12 or 13 floors depending on the dungeon, counting a mini-boss on the way down. They're fun to get through, but it's a bummer there isn't at least one more to play. The two dungeons get a little stale if you aim to complete everything Boyfriend Dungeon has to offer. By the time I had maxed out two weapons, I already completed the available dungeons. There is a double XP bonus for the remaining weapons after completing the first, but the lack of enemy variety meant all my interest had to come from how weapons played differently. And for the weapons I didn't like playing with – and if I didn't like their character’s story either – it was just getting through it for the sake of doing so. (Normally I'd skip character paths I don't enjoy, but for the sake of this review, I wanted to see all the storylines through. Finding everything and completing all paths took about 12 hours.) There are other ways to dish out damage: Zines give you the power to toss fireballs, summon a bug ally, or even place a cute little turret to help do damage. Zines have to be crafted, and their recipes are randomly given out as you explore the dunj. You can also make gifts using a simple crafting system to give to romance partners and increase their experience faster. There are also clothes you can make to deal bonus damage, a slew of other bonuses, or even unlock alternate music. Running back through the dungeons to try and find all the recipes did give them a little incentive of extra replayability. Some of the Zine powers do unfortunately introduce gameplay bugs, though, like getting destroyed by your own weapon's power or getting stuck behind walls. Recipe hunting was my main motivation toward the end as I finished up the remaining character stories quickly. I was glad to focus on something other than their problems and the awkward romantic interactions I accidentally got myself into. Also, it seems that the weapon you beat the replayable final battle with sort of gets the last word in with you, almost cementing them as your final ""choice."" Almost. The messiness of dating everyone at once meant I didn't really feel all that close to anyone – if anything, I just felt a little guilty. Boyfriend Dungeon could have been a cool combat-heavy spin on the dating sim genre, but its uncomfortable forced interactions with the villain, inconsistent dialogue options, and limiting dating structure make it a disappointment. The fun weapons deserve more to cut and destroy and we deserve more time to decide whether or not we want to jump into a romance — or dump it. "
219,Axiom Verge 2 ,7.0,"Axiom Verge 2 heard you liked Metroid, so it put Metroid in your Metroid so you can blast baddies and hunt for hidden goodies across two sprawling 2D maps at the same time. Granted, opening a game review with an Xzibit reference in 2021 might be a bit outdated, but Axiom Verge 2 is anything but: it infuses its retro-inspired sequel with contemporary ideas like fast-travel to minimise backtracking and an optional approach to the bulk of its boss fights in order to make progression smoother for players of all skill levels. This focus on accessibility comes at a cost, though, resulting in a Metroidvania that’s consistently rewarding to explore but noticeably lacking in combat challenge and diversity. Axiom Verge 2’s story is fleshed out by countless hidden notes and computer terminal messages, but I won’t even attempt to summarise it since it’s dense with the same sort of pseudo-scientific technobabble that pervades its 2015 predecessor. Lingo-heavy lore aside, I found the basic plight of its main character, Indra, more than enough to propel me forward through the roughly eight-hour adventure; after she arrives at an Antarctic research base looking for her missing daughter, one thing leads to another and she suddenly has the power to absorb the unique abilities of nanomachines known as Arms. That’s really all the setup and motivation I needed.  Axiom Verge 2 may feature an entirely new lead character and setting, but what really sets it apart from the original game is the ability to phase in and out of the Breach; an alternate dimension running parallel with the main overworld sort of like Stranger Things’ Upside Down if it was being emulated on a Game Boy Color. Each side of the dimensional divide has its own unique map structure and feel; Indra’s world features arcane ruins and dimly lit caverns to explore, while the more abstract Breach consists of chunky, hypercolour platforms and pulses to the sound of a bouncing chiptunes soundtrack. This contrast doesn’t just make for appealing shifts in aesthetics, it brings a literal extra dimension to navigating your way through Axiom Verge 2. Not only do you need to puzzle your way to unlock gates and uncover hidden power-ups within each separate world as per the tried-and-tested Metroid template, but you also use interdimensional tears to hop back and forth between realms to circumnavigate obstacles in one dimension by finding an alternate path in the other. Orienting yourself in two places at once inspires a degree of non-linear navigation that’s a consistently absorbing challenge as a result. It’s also a mechanic that continues to evolve over the course of the journey. Initially, you can only shift from one world to the other at predetermined Breach gates on each map, but eventually Indra is given the ability to both reveal hidden tears and also manipulate the placement of a tear in order to crossover to more precise areas. Not being able to see exactly where you’re going does introduce some trial and error, but the ability to fast-travel to any previously discovered save point gave me the freedom to experiment with blind leaps between worlds, knowing that I could beam back for a do-over if I accidentally blinked into the wrong spot. Even with double the map to cover, I found Axiom Verge 2 to be far more intuitive to explore than the original game. Each area of both maps feels far more distinct in terms of terrain, and a compass found early on subtly steers you towards your next objective. Any backtracking I did was typically with a clear purpose, to return to that suspiciously fragile-looking wall after I’d unlocked Indra’s shockwave power, perhaps, as opposed to pacing back and forth across multiple rooms because I had trouble distinguishing one from the next. Meanwhile, Indra only grows more fun to control over the course of the journey, consuming a steady diet of power-ups that transform her over time from humble platforming heroine to shapeshifting Swiss Army Knife equipped to scale almost every structure in her path. However, compared to its clever dual-world exploration, Axiom Verge 2’s combat is fairly one-dimensional. There’s certainly a healthy variety of enemy types to contend with in both maps, with mechanical kill-bots of all shapes and sizes in Indra’s world and a gaggle of more amorphous organisms in the breach, but the arsenal you’re given to tackle them with is surprisingly conservative compared to the the two-dozen or so different projectile types that could be bolted onto the original game’s transforming Disruptor rifle. Indra begins with a pickaxe for close-up attacks and a boomerang for ranged assaults, while her drone – which she must pilot remotely through the Breach zones – can swing a tethered spinning blade and use a grappling hook to launch itself at enemies like a pinball. But despite the handful of additional melee weapons to find and the inclusion of a skill tree to upgrade basic attributes like attack speed and power, my simple slash-’em-up method for fighting didn’t ever change – because it didn’t need to. I never stopped to ponder if I should be using the bronze axe or if I should switch to the sickle sword because the right tool for the job always seemed to just be whatever I happened to have equipped at that moment. There were certainly visceral thrills to be had smashing my way through each roomful of robotic hordes, and the fighting is certainly fluid, but I wish I’d felt as inspired to cave in heads as I was figuring out ways to head into caves. Axiom Verge 2 attempts to inject some strategy into fights by giving Indra the ability to hack enemies and other objects, but I found this feature much more useful for passive jobs like triggering switches to open doors or to hijack moving platforms than I did for any meaningful combat gains. If you’re close enough to latch onto an enemy within Indra’s small hacking radius, you’re likely close enough to slash them to bits rather than take that extra step to hack their movement speed in order to slow them down first. And if you happen to take a few blows in the process, you can be guaranteed that seemingly every other enemy you dispatch will leave enough health orbs behind to keep you continuously topped up anyway. Boss fights are similarly straightforward, should you choose to take them on. While the standard approach to boss fights in Metroidvania games is to trap you in a fenced-off area and force you into a claustrophobic confrontation with a monolithic monster, Axiom Verge 2 allows you to take a pacifist’s approach if you’d prefer. With rare exception, you can just evade each boss entirely and continue on your way to your next story objective, which will likely be a welcome feature for people who tend to bounce off these kinds of games when the going gets tough. (The couple of boss encounters that are mandatory grant you with unlimited respawns to help get you through.) The problem is that if, like me, you relish the tension and eventual dopamine hit of toppling a towering behemoth often by the skinniest sliver of your health bar, then you’ll likely be disappointed in Axiom Verge 2’s boss battles. While they certainly look imposing, from a marauding mechanized bull to a downsized Death Star, few require much in the way of strategy beyond maybe a quick hack to short-circuit their defence systems followed up with some frenzied slashes until they explode. There are no distinct waves of attack to analyse and adapt to, nor is there any requirement to experiment with Indra’s expanding set of abilities in order to overcome them. I went into Axiom Verge 2 hoping for the next Hollow Knight, but what I got instead was a series of hollow victories.  While there aren’t individual difficulty modes to select, you can hop into the pause menu and increase the enemy damage multiplier to up the challenge a bit. But this just makes the combat more attritional as opposed to making it any more dynamic. I found the boss fights to be so underwhelmingly innocuous and repetitive, in fact, that I didn’t actually realise I was fighting Axiom Verge 2’s final boss until after I’d beaten it and was suddenly watching the credits roll. It brought the experience to what felt like a very abrupt ending, and left many of the power-ups I acquired deep in the latter half feel significantly underused. I admittedly went back to my pre-end boss save game and spent another few hours hunting for secrets by using these late-game abilities, like breaking up into a cloud of nanites to pass through steel grates into walled-off areas or piloting a remote-controlled boomerang to hit otherwise unreachable switches. These power-ups were certainly fun to use, but scouring the two maps for more skill upgrades after I’d already comfortably beaten the biggest enemy threats only felt worthwhile mainly from a completionist’s standpoint. Axiom Verge 2 is a dual-dimensional Metroidvania that’s genuinely engaging to explore. Phasing in and out of the Breach to unlock new paths through the overworld – and vice versa – presented me with consistently stimulating environmental puzzles to solve, a process that evolved in surprising ways over the course of the campaign as hidden dimensional tears were uncovered and the manipulation of their placement was introduced. The same sense of accomplishment can’t be derived from the simplistic combat and mostly toothless boss fights, the last of which is responsible for the story stumbling to an anticlimax. Ultimately, Axiom Verge 2 is a sequel that largely delights thanks to its dual-world design, but I wish the developer could have polished it without having to file the difficulty spikes all the way down. "
220,Assassin's Creed Valhalla: The Siege of Paris ,6.0,"As the last planned expansion in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s first season pass, The Siege of Paris feels like the series going out with more of a whisper than a shout. New and interesting activities are in short supply while content that is functionally identical to the rest of the main game flows like wine. And even the return of the fan favorite more open-ended assassination missions and strong character performances can’t save the story from feeling run of the mill at best. As with the previous expansion, Wrath of the Druids, two new visitors to Ravensthorpe arrive with the intention to butter Eivor up and convince them to sail to a faraway land and solve their problems. After a little wining and dining, Tolk and Pierre, charming representatives of the Elgring Clan, succeed in commissioning the Wolf-Kissed to ship off to Francia and help in their plight against the Mad King, Charles the Fat. Assassin’s Creed Unity’s Black Box missions (coincidentally, also based in France). These are welcome additions to the formula, adding multiple avenues of progress to your target and the freedom to complete missions the way you want to. They offer some hard to miss prompts to get you started before branching into various opportunities to gain intel and find shortcuts that you wouldn't get otherwise. Infiltrations also often result in particularly brutal cinematic assassinations if you follow all of the leads correctly. It’s not quite Hitman-levels of freedom, but the relative openness is a call back to the series’ history that I didn’t know I missed until now. Even with the satisfying creative freedom of its Infiltrations and the brisk bite that scythes add to combat, The Siege of Paris doesn’t feel like an essential addition to Assassin’s Creed Valhalla. Its story provides a truly memorable menace in King Charles, but otherwise doesn’t stand out much from what we’ve already seen, substituting Breton soldiers with Frankish ones. Valhalla of course remains fun on its own merits, but the base adventure already has Mjolonir’s weight in nearly identical content. "
221,Grime ,9.0,"Grime is rock hard. A Souls-influenced take on the side-scrolling Metroidvania, sprawling in scope yet intricate in detail, it stands resolute, patiently waiting for you to reveal its secrets while testing your mettle with bouts of tough combat and rigorous sequences of platforming. Progress is earned in increments where lessons are not just learned but fully internalized. You chip away, chisel in hand, until Grime eventually reveals itself as a thing of beauty – a monument to whatever we're calling this genre today – and one of the best ""Souls-vanias"" of recent times. For all its difficulty, what's more notable is Grime's generosity. Killing enemies and discovering secrets earns you mass, the primary currency and the equivalent of souls. But unlike most other similar games, in Grime you don't lose your mass when you die. You keep it.  This one design choice has a profound effect. By letting you retain mass upon death, Grime lets you level up after you die. You respawn back at the last surrogate (Grime's term for a Dark Souls-style bonfire) and can immediately spend mass to increase your health or stamina for a little extra survivability, or boost one of the three damage-dealing stats (strength, dexterity, and resonance). The returns here aren't enormous – they're improvements at the margins, at best a few percentage points with each level-up – but the process feels significant in terms of the sheer relief. Sure, you died, and you're gonna have to repeat what is in all likelihood a large section of the level, but you get to hang onto everything you picked up along the way and gain the benefit of being slightly better equipped to tackle its challenges on your return. It's liberating. The additional stress of the corpse-run, of retracing your steps to recover your lost cash while knowing that another death means permanent loss, is absent here. It doesn’t make Grime easy by any measure, but it does mean you never feel punished for failure. Instead, you're afforded an infinite supply of missteps, and each time you’re picked back up again, dusted off and delivered a little pep talk before you’re sent on your way once more. More than that, though, the lack of penalty encourages experimentation and exploration. I never felt that nagging doubt over whether I should press on into uncharted territory or retreat to the last checkpoint to cash in. I simply explored. Grime's map is a dense network of tunnels, chambers, and nooks and crannies, all looping through and around each other, interconnecting in places both expected and surprising. I greeted each junction with an inquisitive confidence, keen to discover what lay ahead rather than the almost paralyzing anxiety over which path is the right one to take that often accompanies more punitive Soulslike design. This approach dovetails with the areas where Grime adheres more closely to the Souls template, such as storytelling. Echoing From Software's restraint, NPCs speak in riddles and metaphor, alluding to grand-sounding beings and events whose mystery is deepened by the impression you're only barely scratching the surface. Other characters are even less coherent – muttering away, unconcerned by your presence, lost in their own little worlds. Even your overall goal is unexplained beyond the impishly cryptic utterings of the few NPCs who seem invested in your journey. Silent as a stone, Grime sustains mystery and heightens moments of revelation by wilfully withholding information. And because it encourages you to explore and experiment, it was so rewarding to discover all of its little secrets and nuances and intricacies on my own terms. While the basics are explained, much is left for you to figure out. Each of the Metroid-style abilities acquired after defeating a boss have their primary function explained, but they all possess a secondary use or variation that may not become apparent until hours later. Unlocking these tiny epiphanies – ""Wait, that's how THAT works?"" – provided some of the most delightful moments of my time with Grime. But there were also plenty of moments when I thought about giving it all up. You may notice that this review is going up more than a week after Grime came out, and that’s largely because it is very difficult to beat (also because I hit a game-breaking bug and had to restart, but that was fixed before release). It's a tough, demanding experience, and of course there are no difficulty options. Even with the salve of being able to spend mass upon death, there were still plenty of occasions when I feared I wouldn't make it to the end. The combat is tough. Enemies hit hard and often, and your stamina bar depletes rapidly. Get yourself in a bad spot and you'll quickly find yourself dead. But enemy attacks are readable – even telegraphed – and you're equipped with useful moves to avoid them. Dashing can be used to put distance between yourself and an enemy, or to dodge through them and their advance, thanks to an ample period of invulnerability. Attacks can be parried with the correct timing, and eventually a staggered enemy can be absorbed as you literally seize its final breath. Killing enemies by conventional means is usually quicker than absorbing their breath, but sometimes you'll want to get in an early parry to eliminate their shield before switching to your preferred weapon to finish the job. There's considerable variety here, with the numerous swords, axes, and clubs, each falling somewhere on a granular spectrum from ""hits light and fast"" to ""hits hard but slow."" Even within a category, similar weapons are distinguished by their moveset and it's worthwhile keeping two equipped in case one is more suitable to the task at hand. I played a ""strength build"" at first, settling on a club and sword that were both described as slow, and output a similar amount of damage, but the distinct arcs of their respective attacks – both light and heavy – meant I found myself switching between them constantly and really enjoying having to think about which weapon was going to be more effective at any given moment. Underlining the complexity Grime wrings from its weapon variety, on a second character I opted for a ""dex build"" and was pleased to realise I had to rethink the tactics I adopted during combat, even finding enemies that had given me trouble previously were now dispatched more easily (and vice versa). The handful of arms that scale with the resonance stat are more exotic – to the extent that I didn't even understand how they worked during the brief time I spent with them – and left me anticipating what new discoveries a third character would bring. The fine balance of combat is the tension between absorbing and attacking. Parrying is risky because a mistimed attempt leaves you open to counter-attack. Successfully parrying will do some damage but it's nowhere near as effective as attacking, and trying to parry more than one enemy at a time is usually a terrible idea. But some enemies need to be parried before you can hit them with your weapon, and you need to parry to be able to absorb an enemy's breath – and that’s a maneuver vital to both replenishing your ability to heal and unlocking traits that boost your performance. It's a lot to think about in the heat of the action, especially when you're trekking through lengthy areas where the combat feels relentless, multiple enemy types are testing you with wildly different attack patterns, the platforms are littered with harmful environmental hazards, and you're still expected to perform some deft acrobatics. It's, well… it can be A LOT. But gradually applying order to chaos is such a satisfying process; learning to read enemy behaviours, when to prioritize absorbing and when to start attacking, which enemies to take down first, how you're going to make time and space to use your heal, and how you're going to escape if necessary. It all helps distil a sense of clarity in the face of what can feel like overwhelming odds.  The boss fights are tougher still. With the exception of the first, every boss is a stern challenge; even the easier ones required me to make double-digit attempts, and I was stuck on the hardest for an entire weekend and countless deaths. Even so, I enjoyed every minute of it. The boss designs are visually arresting and, at first, feel like nothing you've encountered before. A couple of late-game bosses, in particular, initially seem impossible, leaving me wondering – even after many attempts – how anyone could conceivably avoid that attack or when I'll ever get a chance to deal it some damage. But I soon started to discern familiar elements, began to appreciate its attack patterns, and recognised sparse windows of opportunity. I realised there's nothing unfair about them, nothing I couldn't have anticipated and avoided if I’d done your homework and remained vigilant. And yet, if anything, the platforming is toughest of all. Not consistently so, I should make clear – most of the time I explored Grime with ease, running along solid ground and performing simple jumps and dashes. But when the platforming ramps up, it raises the overall challenge to its peak. For me, at least, the difficulty here is derived from the sheer length of the trickiest platforming sections, not because they demand precision. They're tests of endurance, of whether you can string together screen after screen of jumping, dashing, and just generally flinging yourself in between all manner of deathtrap without missing a beat and falling to your doom. And they're exhausting to undertake, right up until the point you finally clear them and that exhaustion is swept away by exhilaration. This became the cycle for me throughout Grime: exhaustion then exhilaration. It's a draining experience since for much of the time it demands all of your attention and concentration. Many sections and encounters, whether heavy with combat or platforming or occasionally both, initially feel impossible. I put down the controller many times, thinking to myself ""I'm never going to get through this."" But I persisted, I paid attention, I experimented, I regrouped, and then I tried again and again and again, learning a little more with each failure. Each daunting new challenge I broke down into its constituent parts, identifying how I'd evade that attack or how to position myself for the timing of that jump, and I was able to conquer the challenge by putting those parts back together, piece by piece. In the end I felt like a master craftsman. I'd spent dozens of hours chipping away at Grime, steadily knocking it in to shape, revealing its textures and contours. Grime is still rock hard, but as the credits rolled, I could put down the chisel, sit back, and admire its beauty. Grime is an exceptional Souls-inspired take on the 2D Metroidvania. An intricate, stone-carved world full of mysteries provides a sure-footed foundation for deep, finely-balanced combat and breathless, devious platforming. Best of all, it's a Souls-like that forgoes punishment in favour of encouragement, happy to lend a helping hand whenever you fall. "
222,Tribes of Midgard ,7.0,"If you took Torchlight, mixed in a heaping helping of Norse mythology, and topped it off with the looming apocalypse countdown from The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, you'd have something that looks a fair bit like Tribes of Midgard. This fast-paced, colorful action RPG doesn't give you a lot of time to breathe and explore its exciting world when you’re racing against time. But when you work together with friends to overcome its challenges, that tension can be rewarding. There are two distinct ways to play Tribes of Midgard, and both revolve around protecting a seed of the World Tree at the center of an upgradeable settlement. Endless mode just lets you see how long you can last against infinitely increasing waves, but it's the less interesting of the two. I'll mostly be talking about the story-based Saga mode, in which you have about two hours to complete a set of objectives and defeat a final boss before an endless winter overtakes the map and renders it uninhabitable.  By day, you'll roam around a set of diverse and increasingly dangerous areas completing simple quests, levelling up, and gathering materials and souls to upgrade your gear and your settlement. The quests themselves are pretty straightforward and predictable: Go kill something, bring me some items, clear out a mini dungeon. The satisfying combat holds this all together, but Midgard soon reveals itself to be more of a time management game than anything. Get as much done by the light of day as you can, because every night you'll have to warp back to your settlement to defend it from the minions of Hel. Given how diverse, detailed, and intriguing the world can be though, I often found this hindered my ability to really explore and enjoy it. Throwing a comically oversized wrench into this routine are the lumbering jotnar, who will appear from time to time at the edges of the map and slowly plod toward your village. They're not the most challenging bosses in the world, with slow and obvious attack animations that are fairly easy to avoid. But their massive health pools present a strategic challenge: waiting too long to take them out might mean you can't topple them in time before they wreck your base. Of all the tribulations Tribes of Midgard sent my way, these were probably my favorites. The issue is, even though single-player is listed as a feature on Steam, this is all just too much to keep up with by yourself. Tribes of Midgard is very clearly intended to be a co-op game, and it definitely works much better when you can get a big squad of up to ten vikings together with a clear plan and good communication. But alone, it feels like if I'm not sprinting from objective to objective with the efficiency of a speedrunner, there's no way I'm going to be able to finish everything before the Fimbulwinter sets in. Being able to increase the time available before the Apocalypse in solo mode would make it much more enjoyable, since certain things like gathering speed don't scale when you're alone. On your way to doomsday, you'll have to personally harvest a lot of resources like wood and stone that can be used to build new base structures, upgrade defenses, and level up your NPC crafters. This is an interesting resource management layer, but it often felt like a lot of the upgrades weren't worth my time. Since certain materials like stone are so rare, if I spent them to strengthen my base rather than on critical objectives like repairing the bridge to a boss area, it seemed like I was setting myself up for failure. Especially in a group, it seemed easier to just defend the base ourselves and save on materials. The indignity of losing your Tree or freezing to death is mitigated a fair bit by the fact that you still earn profile XP and account-bound currency based on how many days you survived and how many bosses you killed, even if you die or have to abandon a session. You can also unlock new character classes by completing certain achievements. Eventually you can earn the ability to start with better gear or more resources, but the benefits for grinding out profile levels drop off after a while since you'll mostly be unlocking side-grades and crafting recipes, where I would have liked to see some even stronger starting gear for all that time investment. At least new playstyle options offer some incentive to keep at it. The starting Warrior is a good all-arounder with an upgraded dodge roll that will let you avoid trouble. I really liked the Berserker, who does more damage the longer she stays on the attack. And you can open up some really nice synergies later on with support classes like the Warden, who can decrease crafting costs and teleport back to base on a reduced cooldown. I should also mention that there is a premium currency you can buy with real money, but it’s only used for cosmetic items, there are no randomized loot boxes or gambling elements, and you can unlock everything without paying other than the Deluxe Edition exclusive cosmetics. When you're playing with your whole clan, Tribes of Midgard is an exciting, hectic, co-op rush to hold off enemies and the elements – It's just a bit too unforgiving if you want to go it alone. Slaying a mighty jotun and racing against the coming of Ragnarok makes for plenty of Norse-flavored fun, but I longed for the chance to explore and interact with its world and systems with less constant upkeep, and at my own pace. "
223,Crowfall ,5.0,"Most modern MMOs have their own take on the usual questing, exploring, and dungeon crawling, with player-versus-player combat as an afterthought, but Crowfall skirts all of that entirely. Instead, it focuses on relatively short PvP campaigns that last for at least 30 days – seasons, basically – that are meant to culminate in full-on, guild-vs.-guild warfare by the end. If you stick with it that long you might even experience a siege or a fortress battle. And if you’re especially lucky, you might even get to build your own realm. However, much like the similarly PvP-centric EVE Online or older games like Dark Age of Camelot, it’s unlikely that the average person will ever get to do that without joining the most powerful guild on the server – or being willing to pay for the privilege of decking out your custom realm via Crowfall’s cash shop. Crowfall’s single best feature is its character creator. Among the 12 fantasy races and 11 classes are some genuinely interesting picks, like the giant Stoneborn and the gerbil-esque Guineceans. All of them offer totally unique abilities and the class system is versatile, allowing you to switch your role on the fly by slotting Major and Minor Disciplines in and out at any time. This system is especially robust thanks to the highly detailed Crowpedia, which you can pull up directly from the talent tree menu and get an overview of each area of specializations your classes, races, and Disciplines can follow. There is a bewildering quantity of traits and abilities you can mix and match, and it’s always fun to play around with and experiment with different traits. It’s also cool that each class also features three different Promotion Classes, which are subclasses that allow you to push your customization that much further.  However, all that choice doesn’t always amount to a great experience in the end.  There's an introductory leveling arc from one to 30 that encompasses the tutorial, and it's pretty short in practice. But the thing MMO fans have to be aware of is that this tutorial is the only place in Crowfall in which you’ll find any quests at all – and even then, they only amount to basic “run here, do this” kind of stuff at best. While it’s important for you to learn your class before being trusted to lead a full-blown siege, this whole tutorial section feels like a meaningless buffer. For one, until close to the very end, it’s only teaching you how your class operates when fighting small groups of PvE enemies and no other players. It’s great then that with subsequent alt characters, you can simply use the Sacrifice mechanic - where you can sacrifice items and gold to shrines in exchange for experience points - to simply exchange your way back up to level 30. But this is hindered by the fact that sacrificing too many items at once and reaching the next level stops you from receiving more experience points. That’s right: if you drop an entire pile of gold into the sacrifice altar, you only receive enough experience to level up one time. If you use too much at once, that’s too bad, because the rest of the stack disappears into the ether. You can work around this by deliberately splitting up your items and planning it all out, but the fact that you would need to do that 29 separate times to go from one to 30, is a testament to how clunky this interface is. But even if you train your character all the way up to that level by doing the PvE tutorial content, once you get out into the PvP zones, it’s clear just how unprepared you actually are to fight other players without switching up your playstyle or even reworking your entire class specializations. Builds that promised to be interesting against the AI enemies you fought in the tutorial quickly melt down into min-max territory, since domination in PvP combat ultimately boils down to who can hit the hardest the fastest, and who has the numbers on their side. Since the tutorial skims over the important facets of guild-vs.-guild and faction-vs.-faction warfare, it’s easy to immediately feel lost if you weren’t taking notes. There’s really no bridge between Crowfall’s tutorial and Crowfall itself; you have to find one in the form of other players, and this is hit or miss. What I soon discovered is that whether you have any fun in Crowfall is determined by how much you're willing to grind, and the most interesting facets of Crowfall’s endgame – castle and keep conquests, and the Eternal Kingdom system where you can eventually design your own zone – are locked behind a herculean undertaking of many players grinding in organized repetition. Or you can just join a faction and run around in the Skypoint zone and its neighbors, like The Solarium and The Arboretum, where you can casually gank other players. But this is boring, since Skypoint is a small zone without much room for any kind of tactical engagements, often leaving you running in circles while you capture the same points and kill the same group of players for loot and gold. Strongholds exist in Skypoint, but they’re not quite as captivating or rewarding to engage with as their endgame counterparts. A step up from Skypoint is the faction-vs.-faction game mode called The Shadow, which is theoretically more player-friendly than the guild-vs.-guild-focused endgame, but ends up falling flat in that regard. On one hand, it’s impossible to coordinate with the rest of your faction in-game if nobody is responding to the specific “Faction” chat channel. If that’s the case, good luck organizing at all, since the maximum number of players you can invite to your party is six. Even if you do manage to coordinate enough support, you still need to wait hours or potentially days for the next keep to become available to siege. On the other hand, despite The Shadow being a supposed “bridge” between the tutorial and The Dregs, it’s easy to spin your wheels here for hours with very little to show for it. This is especially aggravating given that the rewards you get for winning an entire 30+-day faction-vs.-faction campaign are equivalent to what you can earn from a few hours of farming low-effort targets in The Dregs. For this reason, most guilds worth their salt will still end up steering clear of The Shadow anyway, other than to troll new players – which completely defeats the purpose of having an “easily accessible” faction-vs.-faction mode in the first place. As it stands, the real end game is supposed to begin in Crowfall’s guild-vs.-guild area, called The Dregs. Again, if you’re the kind of MMO player who likes to go solo most of the time, you need not apply. In fact, everything in Crowfall's guild-vs.-guild area is designed to be effectively inaccessible to solo players. But the shift into joining a guild – let alone finding one that’s both welcoming and active – is jarring when first ascending out of the unclear and monotonous tutorial section. But okay, let’s assume you’ve gotten your group together: it still doesn’t seem like there’s much to do besides rove around the open world and gank smaller groups of players while capturing outposts and attempting to dominate parts of the various disconnected zones located across your server. That might be entertaining enough for a few hours, but it doesn’t hold up for long. The only two meaningful alternatives to this are sitting in a circle and harvesting ore and wood for hours to build your guild’s stockpile, or farming the same boring elite enemies and bosses for loot. That’d be fine if any of those systems were fun to engage with, but they’re simply not. For a game that is so focused on PvP above all else, Crowfall’s battles lack a feeling of rhythm and deliberate pacing. You can simply hold the left mouse button near an enemy and it will eventually die. In Crowfall’s best moments, it’s slippery; at worst, it’s brain-numbing. Despite all of the different skills and abilities I could dole out to my character through the Discipline system to liven up my humble Guinecean Duelist – or my later alt, my Stoneborn Champion – each and every battle boiled down to a frantic button mash where I held my left mouse button down while randomly tapping the assortment of DPS abilities on my hotbar, some of which at least used a secondary resource called Pips that would refresh intermittently as I attacked. However, this was still too lenient to afford any interesting interplay to my skills, especially since none of them needed to preempt one another in order, a la Final Fantasy 14. Some Major Disciplines - equippable skill sets that can augment your class - do offer up combo skills that need to fire off in sequence, but it still takes a lot of extra work to find the right match of Disciplines that keep your character effective and fun to play. Granted, Duelist is a class that is supposed to be able to do a ton of melee or ranged damage in a short period of time, but playing as one gets old quickly; every fight in the open world boils down to a skirmish where you and your opponents basically slide around and whittle one another’s health bars to zero without much more strategy, nuance, or class interplay beyond the basic “Healers heal, tanks take a lot of damage, DPS stabs things.” This simplicity undermines all that aforementioned customization that makes the character creation so interesting. The only clear caveats here are the Ranger class, which can see much further than the average character, and the Assassin’s (and the gerbil-like Guinecean’s) ability to move around undetected by enemy players. Both of these feats make it viable for some players to slip off to the side and go on scouting missions, which is interesting in theory, but doesn’t actually help much once the fighting starts if your side is grossly outnumbered, and especially if the opposite team has the funds to bring in siege weaponry. Crowfall might’ve been onto something here with its player-versus-player metagame as well, but the unfortunate reality is that there’s a deep, empty divide between the repetitive tasks that make up the nuts and bolts of what you’re actually doing moment-to-moment compared to the theoretically much more interesting Eternal Kingdom system and siege events. Those are dotted across each map, beckoning you to join them, but they only happen at specific times of the week and are only really available to hardcore players: yes, it’s possible for a casual group to eventually work their way up to building an empire in Eternal Kingdom or fighting in castle sieges in the Dregs, but good luck with that. On paper you can earn it, but in practice it’d take weeks of organized effort, harvesting materials in the wilderness, and repeatedly grinding outposts and forts around the clock for a reasonably-sized guild of at least 30-40 players to even touch upon the interesting parts of the endgame, let alone win a campaign. Sure, you can always join the biggest guild on the server and coast on their success, but that’s hardly a great solution considering that the whole appeal of Crowfall in the first place is building up your own guild and guiding it to success. If you want to circumvent that amount of dedication, you can always just disappear into the PvP-lite Eternal Kingdom (where no faction warfare happens whatsoever) and buy your empire via Crowfall’s cash shop. But even purchasing VIP status – which costs at minimum $15 per month at the time of this review – gives you a meager amount of premium currency. It’s not much compared to the price of even a single house for your custom kingdom. Besides the VIP subscription, Crowfall’s cash shop offers many of the items that you would eventually need to build up your own kingdom in your custom Eternal Kingdom realm. It does avoid the sense of being pay-to-win because it’s impossible to gain a competitive edge in guild-vs.-guild or faction-vs.-faction PvP by building up a zone, and it’s impossible to buy your way directly into power via the cash shop. It’s also not pushed onto you or advertised heavily as you play. But it’s worth noting that the absolute grind to make any progress in the Eternal Kingdom system - namely, by establishing your war machine through repetitive organized labor and consistently excelling at sieges in The Dregs - is enough to incentivize just going to the cash shop and buying your way past it because it simply isn’t any fun to do as an individual. At least these zones look great: Crowfall’s minimalist art style is colorful and clean, making it simple to parse in the heat of the action. But the animations are stiff if not downright cheesy, aggravating the earlier issues I mentioned I had with the combat system. Crowfall’s interface is clean-looking as well, but it doesn’t function as well as it first appears. The map is difficult to make heads or tails of, and that makes coordinating with your allies tougher than it should be. It’s extremely minimalistic, forcing you to scroll over its various quadrants and call out coordinates to your teammates in order to figure out where they are if there are more than six of you playing together at once. On top of that, Crowfall’s in-game text chat system is not viable for communicating with your party or to your broader faction or guild when you’re trying to coordinate anything in the moment. This is because you need to tab all the way to your inventory screen in order to switch chat channels. And, instead of collating them together, there’s a unique channel for each type of communication, making it easy to completely ignore critical messages from your faction or guildmates if you simply leave the default General channel open. Worse, the built-in voice chat system rarely works at all. If you can, go with Discord or some other app to talk to your friends as you play. And it goes without saying that your experience hinges upon who you play with. The right group of players (if you can find it) will make this process much more enjoyable. Crowfall can be the type of game where you turn off your brain, sit around with a group of friends, and joke around while grinding your way through The Dregs or Skypoint. The fact that it’s possible to lose all of your loot when you die – especially in The Dregs, where it can take a long time to cover ground – adds just enough tension to make things interesting for a group of engaged players, and I was lucky enough to find my way into a rather casual guild that did exactly that. But I stumbled around for almost a week and a half, skipping from one inactive guild to another, before I finally discovered this group that actually seemed to genuinely enjoy Crowfall despite all its faults.  Crowfall is a hardcore PvP MMORPG that centers around deep guild and faction-building systems, but it doesn’t do much to draw in anybody beyond its most loyal and dedicated players. Sure, if you simply want to run around and kill other players while joking around with a group of friends, this is as good a place as any to do that, if you’re okay with the clunky interface and similarly clunky combat system. The open-world, faction-based PvP systems that it’s built around are clearly designed to pull everybody together to contribute toward a broader goal, but there’s so much grinding involved that it feels like the most engaging gameplay is reserved for only the most dedicated. "
224,Pokemon Unite ,6.0,"The concept of a free-to-play Pokemon MOBA probably sounds like a dream come true to some people and a shameless cash grab to others. As a longtime fan of both Pokemon and Dota 2, I had my doubts about whether Pokemon Unite could successfully mix the best parts of these disparate gaming worlds, but my skepticism turned to delight after seeing how much fun this mobile brawler could actually be... at least for a little while. Unfortunately, Pokemon Unite only partially sticks the landing, resulting in an enjoyable casual MOBA with some dubious microtransactions and little interest in pushing the boundaries of the genre. Pokemon Unite’s premise will be instantly recognizable to anyone who has so much as glanced at a MOBA in the last 10 years: two teams of five players, two symmetrical lanes littered with auto-defending towers, and a “jungle” full of neutral enemies filling the space in the middle and around the edges. Each player takes direct control of a single Pokemon from a decent roster of 21 (including favorites like Greninja and Garchomp) that gets stronger as the match goes on. You’ll clash along the lanes, killing your opponents and pushing toward enemy towers until one team has been driven back to their base, forced to watch helplessly as their towers fall.  Except they don’t actually fall, in Unite’s case. Rather than ending with the spectacular destruction of the enemy’s base, Unite’s matches are on a 10-minute timer with the winning team being whichever squad scores the most points before the buzzer sounds. These points, called Aeos Energy, are collected by defeating the wild Pokemon that spawn around the map, then banked by dunking them Space Jam-style into the enemy team’s Goal Zones, which are Unite’s version of the towers that defend each lane. It’s a cute spin on the established genre mechanics, but the match timer and simplicity of these static objectives eventually left me feeling like I was replaying the same match over and over no matter what Pokemon I selected. I quickly started to notice parallels between Unite and another MOBA that tried to make the genre more accessible: Blizzard’s Heroes of the Storm, which has been quietly plugging along since development was slowed in 2018. Both games have a similarly simplified take on character progression, with each of Unite’s Pokemon having access to just two activated skills during a match (in addition to two set passives and a slow-charging ultimate ability). Each activated skill can branch into one of two options as you level up, allowing you to lightly customize your playstyle mid-match. Take Cinderace, a speedy ranged attacker who, at level 8, can choose between Flame Charge, a damaging dash attack, or Feint, an evasive buff perfect for outplaying. This pared-down system makes your customization choices slim compared to games like League of Legends or Dota 2, but each Pokemon at least feels distinct from the others even within these strict confines, and I was able to find two or three Pokemon that fit my playstyle in just a few matches. After an hour or two of playing, your Pokemon will gain access to three Held Item slots and a Battle Item that add some much needed pre-match depth to the strict A/B nature of leveling. You might take Leftovers, Shell Bell, and a Potion into battle to give yourself extra healing in a pinch, or X-Attack, Scope Lens, and Muscle Band to increase your Pokemon’s burst damage potential. There's even a helpful option to see what builds high level players are using. Pokemon are all slotted into different roles, such as Defender or All-Around, but with the right approach many can break out of their intended playstyle. For example, Held Items are impactful enough that the Support Pokemon Eldegoss can use its superior speed and healing skills to become a formidable fighter too, which is a rewarding level of flexibility to have if you are a player who likes to experiment with unique builds. In true free-to-play fashion, Pokemon Unite launched with a full suite of purchasable Pokemon, cosmetics, and upgrades just waiting for mom’s credit card to set them free. After completing the tutorial and collecting the Day 1 rewards, you will own five Pokemon out of its current roster of 21. Only Pokemon you own can be used in Ranked mode, whereas Standard and Quick matches give you access to an extra set of four rotating daily Pokemon. After that, you can unlock Pokemon for free at a notably slow pace through in-game currency or login rewards – otherwise they will cost you $6-10 each (unsurprisingly, beloved Pokemon like Lucario, Greninja, and Gengar are the most expensive and seemingly some of the most powerful). Thankfully Pokemon selection rarely feels like a major issue with regards to game balance since both teams can use the same Pokemon simultaneously, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t pay-to-win concerns elsewhere. The effects of the aforementioned Held Items can be improved significantly with a currency called the Item Enhancer. You slowly earn this currency as you play, but spending enough real money will let any player gain instant access to a full set of max level Held Items and a noticeable advantage over a free-to-play field with the same playtime. For reference, after dozens and dozens of games I'm not even close to having a single held item maxed, where spending roughly $40 could let you max one out right away. Early community estimations indicate that a single maxed Held Item like the Muscle Band could increase your DPS by up to 10% at level 1. It’s incredibly concerning that a game which encourages competitive play (Held Items are freely allowed in Ranked mode) would allow you to fast track such an obvious advantage for real money, even if these items can be slowly leveled without it. Of course, 10% is not nearly enough to guarantee an instant win, but knowing a small number of players are out there battling with any paid advantage is enough to leave a sour taste in my mouth. Rounding out the microtransactions is the cosmetics store, which allows you to purchase skins for your trainer and Pokemon using the different currencies earned through playing. These outfits have no impact on the matches, and the trainer items even feel a little silly considering how rarely other players will see them. But it is worth noting these are some of the most expensive in-game purchases, with some of the featured outfits costing $10-20 each. Once you find a Pokemon and build that works for you, the actual PVP combat is very satisfying. There are plenty of opportunities to outplay and outsmart your opponents using a combination of your skills, items, and the terrain itself. Escaping a sudden gank or wiping the enemy team with a well-placed ultimate is just as satisfying here as it is in any other MOBA (although the chance you are ruining a literal 10-year-old’s day seems much higher), and it's even more fun when you’re pulling those moves off with your friends using the lobby matchmaking system. Thankfully Unite’s quick matches, small maps, and low cooldowns provide plenty of opportunities for glorious combat, but a good individual performance doesn’t always translate to overall success. The more Aeos energy you gather, the longer the animation takes to dunk it, which can be cancelled by taking any damage. It's frustrating to dominate your lane and build up a healthy supply of Aeos only to be locked out from scoring by the smallest attacks from the opposing team. Perhaps by design, Unite encourages you to move with your team, find your objective, then fight as a unit. This encourages good teamwork fundamentals, but also results in a noticeable lack of strategic variety – especially when the Ranked mode only has a single map. That feeds into my biggest complaint with Unite, and another issue it shares with Heroes of the Storm: map objectives are too powerful to ignore. In a game like Dota 2 there are many ways to win. The team you draft, your lane configurations, and even small decisions like where you place a ward create the story of the match. In Unite, too many games can simply come down to Zapdos, a powerful wild Pokemon that spawns in the middle of the map in the match’s final minutes. Whichever team lands the killing blow is given a massive amount of Aeos energy and the ability to score instantly for a short time. Paired with the decision to reward double points during the same time period, this advantage is too powerful to ignore, offering an insurmountable win for the leading team or an instant comeback for the trailing team with no time left on the clock for a response. Unite’s short match time alleviates some of that pain, but it still hurts to watch your hard-fought battle fall apart over one bad engagement. Of course, this sort of last minute swing can happen in many multiplayer games, but what makes Unite uniquely frustrating in these high pressure moments is its sometimes unwieldy controls, which quite literally takes some of your control away. As of right now Unite can only be played with a controller on Switch, using an impressively slick scheme that undoubtedly makes it the easiest MOBA to quickly pick up I’ve ever played. Even the most inexperienced player should be able to understand the basics of moving, attacking, and using abilities thanks to the informative (and occasionally overbearing) user interface. But the lack of a cursor means you rely on “smart” targeting, using a series of customizable options buried in the settings to decide how your character behaves. Even after tweaking those options, I noticed my Pokemon might choose to target the enemy tank instead of the escaping healer, or my skill reticle may snap to a nearby wild pokemon instead of the approaching ganker. In dire moments, like the aforementioned Zapdos fights, this unlucky targeting may be the factor that decides the entire game, leaving me wondering which option I needed to toggle to prevent future flukes. Some of these complaints may be a little deep in the tall grass for a game that clearly hopes to be a beginner-friendly introduction to the genre – and based on the near instant queue times I have experienced so far, that angle seems to be doing a good job of drawing people in. (The online experience in general is incredibly smooth when using a wired connection, and even features the invaluable ability to reconnect after a dropped connection or rare game crash.) There are even less complex 3v3 and 4v4 Quick match modes that feature smaller maps and slimmed down objectives to really let the combat shine. But Unite’s over-dedication to simplicity can occasionally feel more obtuse than accessible. For example, you cannot see either team’s score during a match, so how close a game is largely remains a mystery until the end. There’s no indication of which attacks deal Physical or Special damage, and item descriptions can be similarly vague. And while the six in-game tutorials are enough to get you started, they don’t explain some of Unite’s own core concepts like lane assignments, jungling, or teleporting, leaving MOBA newcomers underprepared. The disorder continues outside of matches as well due to Unite’s labyrinth of laggy menus, reward paths, and customization options. After spending way too long digging through your battle pass and daily rewards, you have to figure out how to spend your five different currencies at one of the three different in-game stores. A “Claim All” option for your quest rewards and a simplified storefront would do wonders for navigation, but Pokemon Unite is content to follow the industry norms rather than imagine ways they could be better. Pokemon Unite is an entertaining introductory MOBA that checks all the genre’s boxes but has very little of its own to add to the conversation – and questionable free-to-play choices like being able to pay for power even detract from it. Its bite-sized battles and cute presentation can make it a genuinely enjoyable brawler, particularly with a team of friends. But I was feeling the limitations of its oversimplified mechanics before my playtime reached a dozen hours, which made its fast matches start to feel a little too similar. "
225,The Ascent ,7.0,"I’m always up for a good old-fashioned Diablo-style action-RPG. But The Ascent spices things up by setting its horde-hunting, XP-grinding gameplay in a beautifully realized cyberpunk world, then adds another unique layer on top of that by virtue of the fact that combat is more twin-stick shooter than melee clickfest. The result is a game I feel like I haven’t played a thousand times already – and a good one at that. And while it does suffer from some frustrating design choices, it’s nevertheless a fun way to spend 15-plus hours. The first thing you’re likely to notice about The Ascent is that the developers at Neon Giant absolutely nailed the cyberpunk aesthetic. The world of Veles feels grimy and lived in, from the bustling city areas that are crawling with NPCs to the corporate high-rises of the upper class cccbeing literally above everyone else to the aptly named deepStink sewers at the bottom of the world. At least one of the following are on-screen at any given moment: vibrant colors, beautiful rain (it isn’t cyberpunk without rain, after all), and excessive violence. The story, meanwhile, isn’t particularly engaging or memorable, which is a shame given how well-realized the world is. But it’s hardly bad, and I certainly never got bored of looking at The Ascent.  That’s also mostly true about playing it. The Ascent takes a little while to get going – its first couple of hours are a bit dull in the gameplay department, where you’ll be shooting the cyberpunk equivalent of rats, but before long you’re in the power band of this 15-20-hour quest to (what else?) take down a monolithic corporation. All of the tried-and-true action-RPG mechanics are here: a character creator, upgradeable primary and secondary weapons, customizable armor and skills that can each also be leveled up, and sidequests aplenty. Weapon and skill upgrades are the big highlights here, as you can make significant boosts to your health, reload speed, energy level, and other tangible things that have a direct and enjoyable impact on gameplay. Armor never really felt like it could be built up the way your weapons can, but at least I looked like a badass hulking tank by the end, and you’re able to enjoy your build after the closing credits roll because you’ll be dumped back into the world to continue working on sidequests, if you want to. All of this feeds The Ascent’s core gameplay loop. Aim, shoot, dodge, kill, and repeat. Crouching or aiming above your head also factor heavily into combat, though those can sometimes be annoying, such as when you get hung up on a decoration in the environment when trying to roll or when you try to shoot someone who’s on some stairs. Still, most of the time it’s sadistically fun to pull your gun’s trigger here, as many weapons have potent knockback effects or straight-up tear the limbs from your foes. Enemy variety is also deep enough such that you’re encouraged to keep a number of weapons on-hand to take down particular foes, be it a target-seeking energy rifle against a hovering miniboss or a rocket launcher for large spider-bot mini-bosses. While combat stayed relatively entertaining most of the way through, the last stretch of the campaign did test that feeling a bit. As I’ve seen countless times before, The Ascent subscribes to the late-game design philosophy of “just throw all of the toughest enemies you’ve already faced before at you, but all at once,” which has never been particularly fun and certainly isn’t here. The end is just a grind, and it frustrated me more than anything else. Some questionable late-game checkpoint placement didn’t help either, and though there are multiple fast-travel methods available to you, sometimes you’re just stuck walking for quite a while to reach your objective, and there will always be randomly spawned enemies obnoxiously in your way. I recommend bringing a friend along to help numb that endgame pain, though then again co-op makes The Ascent better 100% of the time anyway. The Ascent’s satisfying gun-tastic action-RPG gameplay loop mixes with its beautiful cyberpunk aesthetic to create an overall enjoyable experience. Neither its story nor its characters are all that memorable, and its enemy encounters can stumble toward the end, but its gunplay and ultra-violence in a neon-soaked world combine to craft a co-op-friendly game you don’t see every day. "
226,The Forgotten City ,9.0,"It’s an absolute triumph that a Skyrim mod could reach 3,000,000 downloads, let alone win a national award for the quality of its writing, but 2015 mod The Forgotten City did both. Six years later, this freshly remade standalone game from original developer Modern Storyteller reworks, refines, and greatly expands upon the same cleverly interconnected ensemble cast and morally provocative story of that already fantastic mod. Breaking away from the Elder Scrolls universe finally allows this terrific adventure to come into its own, with plenty of fresh twists, turns, and a heaping helping of self-aware dialogue that can leave your mouth ajar. The Forgotten City begins as you wake up next to the Tiber River with a mysterious hooded figure. After creating your character, they send you into the nearby ruins in search of a stranger named Al, and the rest is Ancient Roman history. No longer set in Skyrim’s Dwemer ruins, this Forgotten City is instead a gorgeous Roman stronghold, complete with historically accurate structures and architecture, including Villas and a public Forum. It even has its very own Aqueducts that provide easy access across the city. It’s all a sight to behold, and the reimagined look and layout makes that true even if you’re a returning fan of the mod.  “The many shall suffer for the sins of the one.” This is the fabled Golden Rule that serves as the central focal point of The Forgotten City’s story, and it dictates that you and the city’s 23 or so residents can’t steal from or attack another human, lest the city’s guardian statues spring to life and methodically turn each citizen into solid gold - trapping them forever. But you don’t need constant combat to make it delightfully fascinating to unravel each of the city’s many delicate layers, and the deeper you go the more obvious it becomes that a life without clear crime is no utopia. The city’s least savory denizens use loopholes, social engineering, and deception to entrap and purposefully mislead one another, skirting the Golden Rule altogether. The Forgotten City is positively dripping with brain teasing moral quandaries as a result – without spoiling anything, there are points where you have to break the Golden Rule, as well as times where you must stop it from being broken, even if it would mean helping innocent people out of awful predicaments. The absolute best part of The Forgotten City is its excellently written characters. Each person has their own motives, problems, and opinions of one another and of the Golden Rule itself to discover, with standouts like the conniving Aurelia being particularly fun to talk to. While I was initially a bit disappointed to see that there were no RPG systems to use during dialogue, especially after a game like Disco Elysium showed just how interesting they could be, the conversations are very engaging without the need to roll skill checks. Those things arguably wouldn’t even fit into what The Forgotten City is trying to do anyway, as its dialogue is tightly written and filled with mysteries to piece together, and your decisions carry more than enough weight as-is. The only misstep with its characters is that their top notch dialogue occasionally suffers from facial animations that range from dubious to outright hilarious. Modern Storyteller says a fix might arrive for launch, but it wasn’t worked out in time for this review, leaving stiff performances from otherwise exquisitely well-written and decently-voiced NPCs. It isn’t exactly the longest adventure either, about 10 hours if you want to see everything and reach the canon ending at a reasonable pace, but it absolutely had me wanting to follow every thread I could find. You can “beat” The Forgotten City early if you don’t want to do everything, but you’re really missing out on its most interesting bits by doing so. It’s practically begging you to tease these layers apart too, and all that intrigue is eventually paid off quite well. In case you do turn all your suspects to gold, The Forgotten City makes genius use of a time loop mechanic to keep your investigation going smoothly. Every time you break the Golden Rule by, say, killing somebody or stealing an item, you must run back to the starting portal and begin the day anew. The world resets to its original state but you keep everything in your inventory, allowing tangible progress from day-to-day and leading to some interesting conversations, such as how you know a character is about to do something or how you have a certain item in your possession that you couldn’t possibly have without stealing it. Retracing your steps each day might sound tedious, but another great touch is that you don’t need to redo every quest each time. You can conveniently send Galerius, the most well-meaning yet tragically impressionable man on the planet, to run off and do each of your previously completed quests for you, bringing you back up to speed every time you need to restart. The Forgotten City has some combat too, but it’s minuscule and quite simple overall. Granted, it isn’t really about action sequences, combat, or platforming – it has all that, but it’s only sprinkled in at appropriate times to improve the pace, and never outstays its welcome. Most of the time, you’ll be sussing out information through dialogue, exploration, and some pretty basic but enjoyable platforming. That last point usually involves shooting arrows from Apollo’s bow, which lets you turn organic material like ivy or algae into gold, providing a solid platform for climbing or launching yourself to the next point of interest. No matter what you’re doing, it’s easy to get swept away by The Forgotten City’s incredibly detailed visuals – another obvious step up from its origins as a Skyrim mod. The whole layout of the world is designed to draw you in and keep you captivated from start to finish. The city itself is built on a mixture of Roman, Greek, Egyptian, and Sumerian architecture and you do meet people from each of these respective cultures as well. But even with the eye-catching environments, some of the most interesting parts of this world are the many smaller items that are decorative by nature, but can still be picked up and examined. Each one is labeled with interesting or educational tooltips, lore, and in-jokes that make every inch of The Forgotten City feel lived-in and real. Beyond the visuals, transitioning to a standalone game has also allowed for the arrival of some welcome quality-of-life features. It’s got less bugs for one, but it also benefits from a much cleaner font and text style than Skyrim, as well as a wildly useful feature that lets you tap a key to automatically follow an NPC if they’re guiding you to a set location. Mimicking a trend among modern AAA games, there’s even a solid in-game photo mode that allows you to capture the sheer beauty of this remote city. The Forgotten City is an incredibly unique and self-aware adventure game that does a fabulous job of exploring complex ideas stemming from a basic question: “what is objectively good?” If you’re expecting a full-blown action RPG that spans dozens of hours, this 10-hour jaunt and its fairly simple combat may only whet your appetite, but it still sports an impressive ensemble cast of likeable but flawed characters who each have something interesting to say. And without spoiling anything, there are moments where the writing is so good it’s practically leaping out of your screen, standing up there with some of the best moments in any RPG. "
227,Samurai Warriors 5 ,7.0,"From the mainline Dynasty entries to the countless anime adaptations and even the The Legend of Zelda spin-offs, the musou formula popularized by developer Omega Force still manages to produce some entertaining battles. The one-versus-one-hundred hack-and-slash action can get repetitive, but each game usually spins a decent yarn along the way. That and the dozens of different weapons available make mowing down hundreds of soldiers an enjoyable way to spend a few afternoons. Samurai Warriors 5 brings all this to modern consoles and PC alongside a visual refresh for its cast of Japanese historical figures that comes together into a safe but satisfying experience. Based on the Warring States period of Japanese history, each Samurai Warriors game so far built on previous entries by adding new characters and covering more obscure historical ground. Samurai Warriors 5 goes for the opposite approach, cutting the roster to the essentials and focusing in a shorter span of time. It may be a tough tradeoff for anyone who’s seen these battles numerous times before, but it makes sense for the type of campaign Omega Force has put in place. Missions split into two paths, with one focusing on series headliner Nobunaga Oda and one on vassal turned rival Mitsuhide Akechi. Opportunities to play as one of the other 37 characters pop up from time to time, but most levels require spending time as the main heroes on the first playthrough.  This decision makes Samurai Warriors 5’s first handful of hours some of its most boring, since bouncing between characters and their various methods of attacking is the real joy of a game like this. Granted, it’s easy to replay missions with any unlocked warrior via Free Mode, but immediately replaying the same mission with a staff instead of a sword is monotonous, so I found that it is usually more interesting to keep going with the next stage and hope for some options on the character select screen. As I got further into both sides of the campaign, the mixture of cutscenes and animated visual novel segments drew me in. The refreshed character designs go a long way to distinguishing all the important players, especially for someone who hasn’t spent thousands of hours with the previous games. In addition, the ink and paint-inspired art style gives everything a distinct flair. No one is going to confuse this with Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, but Samurai Warriors 5 gives the series a standout visual style that impresses throughout. Once you get through the initial chapters and unlock a group of characters, some of Samurai Warriors 5’s true appeal begins to shine through. Playing through a level while wielding a drum that produces energy blasts or an origami dove that freezes foes is what I come to Omega Force games for, and there are plenty of wacky weapons hidden just beneath the surface. It sadly never gets as crazy as Warriors Orochi or Warriors All-Stars, but there’s plenty of over-the-top action here if you want it. Whether you’re wielding a sword or bladed nunchaku, making hundreds of soldiers fly through the air over and over again remains a fun time in small doses. The returning Hyper Attacks ensure that characters never have to leave the action for too long, as their repeated strikes can drag a crowd of enemies forward with you. This both adds to the unintentional humor inherent to Samurai Warriors 5’s hack-and-slash gameplay and keeps combos from expiring as you run between larger groups of foes. Samurai Warriors 5 also makes smart modifications to the tried-and-true musou gameplay loop. In addition to light and heavy strikes, blocks, and Hyper Attacks, you can mix and match a set of four Ultimate Skills on each character. These are weapon-specific and provide both stat boosts and flashy super moves on a generously short cooldown. On lower difficulties, the attack boosts and musou gage refills can make levels even easier than expected, but the extra moves do keep fights interesting. It also lets you save the truly flashy finishing musou attacks for boss battles, which just feels right. Some of the ways that Omega Force promotes these new moves can slow down combat. For instance, there are now groups of opponents with glowing spears or shields that laugh in the face of head-on normal attacks. They only fall to Ultimate Skill attacks – or you can simply walk around them and hit them in the back, in most cases. It’s a small annoyance, though, because these walls of shield-wielding goons can break up a good flow, and that’s a mood killer when you just want to go out there and mindlessly hack and slash through giant crowds. Outside of Story Mode and the ability to replay missions with any characters you like, the only other way to play Samurai Warriors 5 is the Citadel Mode. This is a smaller-scale defense mode that has your chosen warrior running around the battlefield stopping waves of enemies alongside either an AI or co-op partner. Pairing certain characters often can lead to support conversations a-la Fire Emblem, and the missions also earn you resources that you can invest in various upgrade trees that feed right back into the story. Considering how linked the upgrade systems are, it’s confusing as to why the Citadel missions couldn’t have just been on a map alongside all the Story content. I really wanted to invest time here in order to get the most out of my character’s abilities, especially when I was playing on Hard. The missions themselves aren’t anything to write home about, but the prospect of squeezing out extra rounds with more unique characters like the powerful spear-wielding Shingen Takeda or drummer boy Hanbei Takenaka was too much to pass up. Building up your Dojo and Blacksmith allows you to further customize characters, weapons, and even your trusty steed. The usefulness of all these upgrades vary, but you’ll definitely want to at least spend points as you accrue them after each fight. Later upgrades, including the ability to charge up multiple musou attacks and shrug off attacks from archers and other annoying mobs, are particularly recommended for any character who wants to take on the campaign’s later stages. Samurai Warriors 5 will twist itself to appeal to a wide variety of mosou playstyles. If you want to just blast through the campaign as a guy with a sword, Samurai Warriors 5 is a tight story campaign featuring Nobunaga Oda and a few guest stars. If you’re a returning musou fan looking for a new favorite pastime, the side missions and Citadel Mode will keep you busy for hours and hours, although things do feel toned down when compared to past games in the genre. The new art style should override any worries about redesigned characters, as Samurai Warriors 5 looks like a graphical leap over its predecessor and sets the groundwork for a new batch of expansions, spin-offs, and sequels to hack through in the years to come. "
228,NEO: The World Ends With You ,7.0,"I’ve thought about The World Ends With You often in the 14 years since its Nintendo DS debut. Its incredible soundtrack, the irresistible vibes of the city of Shibuya, and its compelling coming-of-age journey stuck with me even when the weird intricacies of its plot had faded. So my desire for its long-awaited Switch sequel, NEO: The World Ends With You, was not necessarily that it would answer every hanging plot thread that had been left at the end of a game I played years ago. Rather, I hoped it could recapture the feelings that made the original so special: themes of growth, connection, and love of a place because of its people. While NEO mostly delivers in that regard, what’s also clear is that Square Enix was so eager to at last revisit the same stories, characters, and places of its predecessor that it left this follow-up little room to tell an interesting new story or reach a new emotional peak of its own. Still, it’s a homecoming that’s pulled off well enough, with a flashy signature style and entertaining combat mechanics that were translated surprisingly well to the Switch. NEO: The World Ends With You takes place in a parallel version of Shibuya, Japan, where the deceased are sent to play a sadistic week-long “Reapers’ Game” for the right to return to life. The passive new protagonist Rindo and his charming cinnamon roll of a best friend Fret are sent to this alternate reality after Rindo has a strange and upsetting vision of Shibuya in chaos, and are later joined by the fangirlish Nagi and returning, math-obsessed, former antagonist Minamimoto. Across seven days, the group completes challenges, fights off strange monster-like enemies called the Noise, and solves puzzles set by the death warden Reapers. It's a set-up that will be familiar to fans of the first game, but with the interesting new twist that instead of pairing off, players can form teams of unlimited size and work together as a group to ""win"" and set their entire group free. This welcome choice that allows NEO to explore a much larger party of allies at once than the first game could, while also opening the door to dynamics between competing players rather than merely implying their existence. Even though Rindo and friends are effectively ghosts, they can still interact in limited ways with the real-world Shibuya by visiting shops or restaurants. And just as in the first game, Shibuya remains a delight to explore, stuffed with fashion, food, music, and culture. It's vibrant and exuberant, packed with real-world references and clearly assembled by a team of artists and designers that adores the actual city. Some of the best objectives in NEO involve getting to know its fictional Shibuya better, whether that’s by exploring its urban legends or seeking out notable landmarks. I loved popping into restaurants to stuff my characters with mouth-watering ramen, piles of fluffy pancakes, and spicy curry, or revisiting shops chapter after chapter to see what hot new couture I could buff them up with. But beyond these bold strokes, NEO is full of small touches that bring its Shibuya to life. You can see them in its detailed art and character designs, and in the flavor text of equipment and the skill-tree-like ""social network."" But the best example stems from Rindo's ability to scan NPCs and read their thoughts. Apart from the required plot moments, scanning serves no gameplay purpose beyond giving you a better understanding of the world of NEO. Passersby will muse about their relationships, idols, TV shows, food, gaming, school, work, and plenty more. You can't do anything with this information, but these pensive moments are well-written and charming, and help paint a brighter picture of NEO's Shibuya and why its inhabitants love it so much. Inseparable from all of this is NEO's music, which continues in the footsteps of its predecessor as one of the most stand-out and bopping video game soundtracks I've ever heard. It spans multiple genres including hip-hop, rock, pop, and metal, and includes plenty of new tracks alongside remixes of fan favorites – often perfectly timed atop big story moments that excited me as a long-time fan. There are very few songs in this playlist that aren’t earworms, though new hits like Kill the Itch, bird in the hand, Breaking Free, and remixes of Calling, Transformation, and Twister are stand-outs. Alongside its joyous portrayal of Shibuya, what further impressed me throughout NEO were the myriad ways in which it was also able to translate the spirit of the original's mechanics and feel onto a very, very different console – one that, in case you didn’t notice, only has a single screen. Nowhere is this more evident than in the real-time battle system, which layers familiar 3D hacking and slashing with a timing-based combo system and a whole host of customizability. NEO succeeds at the unenviable task of following up a dual-screen, touch input-focused system with a button-based one, while still emphasizing teamwork and ""flow"" between the different characters. The World Ends With You on DS had you activating ability-granting “pins” in battle by using different touchscreen motions, such as taps, swipes, or drawing certain shapes. In NEO, each character in your party can now only be equipped with a single pin at a time, with different pins corresponding to different kinds of attacks that are each cleverly assigned to a specific button. For instance, the X button will typically have pins with rapidfire, close-range attacks, while Y has fast long-range moves. Each character can use a pin a certain number of times before it must recharge, making it necessary to balance their usage so you're not sitting on your butt half the battle. The sheer quantity and diversity of pins available made finding them, growing them into stronger forms, and testing them in different combinations to achieve a smooth flow during combat a blast, especially in the later chapters and once I started chasing pins only accessible on harder difficulties.  There’s also a ""groove"" system that rewards you with powerful finishers for correctly timing combos and chaining attacks between different characters that is especially satisfying. I loved the thrill of Fret pulling off a pristine combo with a flaming sword, followed up by a big aerial kick from Minamimoto, passing to Rindo to shoot electricity out of his hands for a spell, and wrapping it all up by having Nagi drop a semi-truck on an enemy's head before launching into a team finisher move, then passing back to Fret to do it all over again. That's a peak I was always chasing, but the reality was that I spent a decent chunk of the roughly 40- to 50-hour campaign experimenting to find the moments where it flowed just right like that. Especially in NEO's first half, you won't have a wide enough arsenal of pins to have perfectly smooth battles every time – or even if you do, your favorite pins might be outclassed by less comfy ones in sheer damage numbers. The solution is usually to grind more or try harder difficulties in the hope of getting better pins, which isn’t necessarily an ideal answer. Though it's worth adding that, having appreciated the difficulty options and associated collect-a-thons from The World Ends With You, I was delighted to see these customizations return in all their robustness for NEO, further giving me reason to return after the credits had rolled. Hitting those good vibes are what will ultimately stick with me about NEO's battle system, but the groove had its missteps, too. For one, NEO's boss battles seemed to only either be effective but unmemorable, or flashy but frustrating. The later hours have a number of battles with some truly fascinating twists and turns, but its dodge and camera controls aren't always up to the task of keeping your team out of danger but also in view. Because you only control one character at a time (whichever one last used a pin), the AI is left to manage the rest of your party and will often walk them through poison clouds or directly into attacks that you correctly dodged, meaning you might lose a fight here or there despite doing everything right. This doesn’t happen often, but in fights with huge enemies boasting hard-hitting moves, it can feel more like you're fighting your comrades than the enemy. I also ran into a few annoying bugs in battles, especially in later chapters. Multiple times, enemies mysteriously got launched outside the official boundaries of the battlefield, making them nearly impossible to hit and forcing me to randomly fire off long-range attacks in the hope a few would connect and eventually whittle down their HP so I could move on. One enemy turned invisible (it was not supposed to turn invisible, though there are other foes that do have this as a functional mechanic) and became completely undamageable by anyone for any reason, forcing me to start a chain of eight interlinked fights all over again. Another time, NEO completely crashed as I was entering a very dramatic boss fight. These were small blips in the grand scheme, but happened just often enough to frustrate and merit mention. Story-wise, NEO is as direct a sequel to The World Ends With You as one could want, despite coming 14 years after it. Without getting into any spoiler-y specifics, put simply: if you liked The World Ends With You and are hungry for resolution to the numerous plot threads left dangling at the end of it, NEO is likely to be very satisfying. I highly recommend either playing The World Ends With You: Final Mix or watching the anime first, though – while the characters try their best to summarize certain major events key to the setup of NEO, the weird intricacies of that story can be difficult to follow if you're just listening to characters deliver rushed summaries to a confused Rindo. What NEO unfortunately sacrifices in its success as a direct sequel are its new, original characters. Rindo, Fret, Nagi, Shoka, Kanon, and other new members of the cast have occasional moments of depth and development, but they never quite reach the heights of the arcs in the first game. The first World Ends With You was all about Shiki, Beat, Joshua, and especially main protagonist Neku coming to terms with their own weaknesses, reckoning with trauma, and growing up a little through their connections with one another. NEO's new cast doesn't get the same space to tackle that growth because they're constantly giving up their own time to returning plots and problems.  Because of the Switch’s two modes, The World Ends With You: Final Remix is simultaneously a good port and a bad one. Using handheld mode and touchscreen controls, Final Remix holds up as a great JRPG with tons of depth. It packs all the flair and charm seen in the DS original, along with some new incentives to keep playing after the story wraps. But the moment you dock the Switch and try to use motion controls TWEWY becomes a pain to play, which eliminates the fun of the new cooperative mode. The rearranged and remixed soundtrack is great and the story delights, but if you’ve played before you may want to think twice before double (or triple) dipping. When they do get a bit of character development, it's usually all smashed into one day here or there, with characters making bold pronouncements about themselves or others with little build-up or explanation. The main protagonist, Rindo, in particular gets done dirty by an arc that boils his problems down to a single, flimsy character flaw he only meaningfully exhibits once or twice. The rest of the time he's not much more than a plot delivery vehicle. Without your lead hero having a meaningful conflict or a central perspective, a lot of NEO’s intended emotional peaks don’t matter nearly as much as they should, whether you played the original or not. That’s a shame, because Rindo and his friends are a genuinely fun group to spend time with, especially compared to the antisocial tendencies of their predecessor, Neku. The writing of NEO is, largely, a delightful bit of work that leans into modern youth and meme culture without coming off as too corny or ""How do you do, fellow kids?"", and it has both the English and Japanese voice acting to match. The one exception is a spoiler-loaded character that appears in the middle of the story, whose speech felt both awkward and appropriative in a way that was totally unnecessary given that character's setup. As someone who adored The World Ends With You as a teenager and waited eagerly for a sequel for over a decade, I found myself feeling a bit conflicted about what NEO tried to do and whether or not it succeeded. It’s a worthy sequel both in how it captures the feel and spirit of the DS game, as well as in the very direct ways in which it follows up its story. But with such a long gap between the two, I found myself disappointed that NEO leaned so heavily on the nostalgia I had for characters I loved as a teenager, and didn’t do more to embrace the new characters and stories I was excited to get invested in as an adult (and especially the ones that headlined all its marketing). It’s hard to say much without spoiling anything, but there’s a point about 20 hours into the 40- to 50-hour story where it becomes very apparent that NEO is not really about what the trailers and box art want you to think it’s about. That might be fine for some, especially those who checked out the Final Mix version of The World Ends With You or the recent anime, but even those connections can’t magically give NEO a theme and throughline of its own as strong as its predecessor. NEO feels like it’s here to finish what The World Ends With You started, and it does that well enough. I just wish it hadn’t sacrificed its own story and characters to do so. NEO: The World Ends With You is a sequel that leans heavily on recapturing what made the original so special. That’s to its benefit in some ways, such as its vivacious depiction of Shibuya, its incredible soundtrack, and its stylish, flowing combat system, but to its detriment in others. Its story satisfies me as someone who had been waiting 14 years for answers to The World Ends With You’s most tantalizing plot threads, but it pays for that resolution by sidelining its new central cast and forgoing a hard-hitting, emotional story of its own. "
229,Death's Door ,9.0,"If Death’s Door were applying for the role of an essential top-down action adventure, it would have quite an impressive resume; with its Zelda-like exploration and dungeon puzzles, engaging fast-paced combat, and levels that’re brimming with irresistible secrets. All of this is wrapped up in a world that deftly walks the line between somber and charming, with its varied yet muted areas full of quiet melancholy, creating a sense of wonder and mystery that proves hard to resist the lure to uncover every last hidden path on your way to reap some souls. The premise for Death’s Door is straightforward yet intriguing: Get to work for the Reaping Commission by harvesting the soul of a particularly strong monster unwilling to submit to the mortal coil. However, when the soul you are commissioned to retrieve is unexpectedly stolen from you, your path leads to a hauntingly beautiful undying realm that holds the titular Death’s Door. To open it, you’ll need to search the lands for three powerful souls in need of a good reaping — by way of some entertaining and challenging boss fights.  Exploring these forgotten lands is a treat: I tracked my quarry through forbidden graveyards, old flooded ruins, and creepy mansions. The slightly dulled color palette gives the impression of exploring locales long past their prime, aided by slow subdued music and faint, unnerving whispers on the wind. Puzzles are plentiful, and while most play on familiar themes of hitting switches, collecting keys, and opening gates, they were all slightly varied and progressively challenging enough to never overstay their welcome. Even the more open regions have you navigating near-labyrinthian twists and turns until you unlock connecting shortcuts, with clever pathways that had me zig-zagging around to reach a dungeon instead of a straight shot, making each place feel more vast than they actually are. Death’s Door also makes smart use of heights – whether requiring you to navigate layered walkways to find the right path to light a torch, or showcasing slightly blurred areas far below my current path of both places I’ve been or had yet to discover. And plenty of mysteries there are, because Death’s Door crams secret pathways into every region. There might not be an overwhelming variety of rewards to find beyond collectible shiny things or health and magic shrines, but the lure of exploration is so omnipresent it was hard for me not to stray from the main path to see where that one ladder leads to, or agonizing over how to reach a health upgrade shrine looming just beyond a seemingly impassible cliff face. While some secrets are locked behind magic tool upgrades and I had to make a mental note to backtrack to grab them later (in true Zelda-like fashion,) there were always plenty of secrets to expose. Curiosity is always rewarded in these places, and I really enjoyed how the normally static camera would smoothly shift and rotate slightly when I got near something, rewarding my efforts with a view of treasures to be gained. So prevalent are its mysteries, in fact, that even after my relatively brief 10-hour adventure ended and the final boss was defeated I was still drawn to uncovering every last secret – and I was extremely happy to find an even bigger enigma waiting to be solved during the post-game that proved impossible to ignore. I don’t want to spoil anything, but uncovering everything to get a 100% clear rating for Death’s Door was easily worth the few extra hours it took. When not lighting torches and activating platforms, my little reaper crow was up to his beak in enemies to slice and dice through. Combat in Death’s Door is decisive and quick; I learned to strike fast and hard before dodge-rolling out of the way of incoming attacks. Perhaps it's due to my avian protagonist's hollow bones, but I found opponents are rarely slowed or stunned by most of my attacks, nor could I block their attacks, which means combat is a delicate dance of figuring out how aggressive you can be before things get painful. The more I progressed, the more thrilling enemy encounters became as I found myself alternating between rolling between melee attackers, quickly sniping exploding pot creatures, and reflecting ranged magic back at evil mages with well-timed sword swings - all in the same fight. Death’s Door may rely a lot on throwing waves of enemies to slow you down, but it’s thanks to the aggressive and rapid pace of these fights that I never got tired of looking forward to the next one. Added to the mix are a few magic abilities you unlock in each of the dungeons, and like in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, most are part puzzle-solving tool and part weapon. Several segments weren’t afraid to challenge me to use these abilities for both purposes at once, and it was fun to see how quickly I could pivot from activating a platform with ranged magic, to returning fire on archers trying to pin me down. Death’s Door takes a very simple yet effective approach to these abilities in that it only gives you a few limited uses in either application, but recharging your magic is as simple as whacking anyone or any destructible object nearby. That meant I couldn’t rely on sniping all my foes with my magic bow, but I could intersperse quick shots between melee strikes if I timed things well. I especially enjoyed the fire spell’s ability to rip a straight line through multiple opponents, and once I uncovered a secret mini-boss challenge I was rewarded with an upgrade to the fire spell that made it deal damage over time. There’s a smattering of different weapons to find and collect, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and combo attacks. I became very attached to a pair of twin daggers that strike in rapid succession and give you a huge lunging dash you can trigger after a dodge-roll, but despite its allure I eventually swapped it out for a giant hammer with a larger reach and a chain-lightning effect that I liked even better. While you can’t upgrade individual weapons, I was encouraged to return to “back to the office” through checkpoint doors to exchange harvested souls for increased strength, speed, dexterity, and magic across the board. I wasn’t a huge fan of this type of progression (as opposed to individual weapon upgrades) at first, but as I claimed the few weapons hidden among the isles I began to appreciate the ease of swapping between them for different encounters and not having to worry about being underpowered. Death’s Door also has a refreshing take on health recovery. There are no health potions to hoard or life to siphon from enemies here; instead, there are collectible Seeds of Life scattered throughout the land – sometimes in the open, and other times hidden away. Planting them in pots you find along your route will immediately sprout a flower to fully heal your corvid warrior. The only catch is that particular flower can only heal you once, until you either die or travel back through one of the many doors to the office hub world (at which point all enemies respawn). For the most part, I felt the pots and seeds were evenly spaced and allowed me to heal up when I needed to, although that may have been due to my exploratory nature (I rarely missed a seed the first time through). If you aren’t diligent, you may find yourself facing down a wave of enemies with no health-giving flowers in sight. Thankfully, the whole “Death overlooking these lands” thing seems to extend to the protagonist as well, because I’d always respawn at the nearest door with no soul currency lost. (Not everything has to be Dark Souls, you know!) Checkpoints are plentiful enough that I was never far from returning to the fray. When it comes to dungeon delving, developer Acid Nerve has created a very enjoyable sense of progression in Death’s Door. Each of the three main regions I explored followed similar rhythms: A large and open introductory zone leads to a confined dungeon where enemies take a backseat to puzzles. Uncovering lost and forgotten souls in these dungeons unveils a path to acquire a major magical upgrade, as you’d expect from a Zelda-like dungeon. These magical boons aren’t given freely though, and you have to tough it out through several enemy waves to be deemed worthy. While the process of getting these magical tools made sense thematically, I always felt like the momentum was slightly thrown off whenever I was transported back to the hub world to get the new ability. That required me to then go find the door leading back to one of the dungeon’s checkpoints, get my bearings again, and search for whatever new path could now be opened with my new ability. All of this leads up to a final inner sanctum moment in the run-up to the boss of the region, and that’s where you’ll have to quickly adapt to taking on greater numbers of enemies and even doing a bit of puzzle-solving at the same time. These sequences are always a blast, like having to manually power a floating platform down a hall, dodging moving pistons, and lighting furnaces, all while under fire from ranged attackers on a far platform. Much like the more somber initial areas, the tension in these segments is further accentuated by some excellent, faster-paced music that urged me onwards. The bosses of Death’s Door themselves are a delight, and most would find themselves quite at home in a top-down Zelda game. They mix cartoonishly evil charm with some impressive attacks that often required me to put my knowledge of the dungeon’s mechanics to the test to come out on top. Noticing the similarity in one of the Frog King’s attacks to puzzles I had solved not too long before was a brilliant “a-ha!” moment in figuring out how to deal with his platform-destroying power. I only wish the third boss had as much of a lasting impact as the others, but even the final boss threw out some major curve-balls that made the whole experience a memorable one. While friendly faces in these lands are few and far between, the comedic timing of the few allies I met were a mood-lightening counterpart to combat and the gloomy undertones of my soul-reaping task. I’m not exactly sure why there’s a seafood shop run by a giant squid strapped to the back of a dead guy, or why he’s trying so hard to convince me he’s just a normal living human with a cool backpack, but I appreciate his commitment. It’s equally amusing to have a friendly gravedigger give a short eulogy after I claimed the soul of each boss. Death’s Door is keen to remind you that your task isn’t an easy one, and even if your targets became corrupted as they sought desperately to live forever for their own reasons, they’re still worth paying your last respects to. As I uncovered the mysteries behind this land of undeath, I began to appreciate what Death’s Door had to say about the hidden dangers of seeking immortality, and its quiet pride on accepting the inevitability of death. Death’s Door is a must for those looking to scratch the itch of a classic Zelda dungeon-delving game, with the added bonus of impeccable combat against waves of foes in a creepy world. Secrets are plentiful enough to offset the low variety of rewards, and the cohesion of puzzle-solving and combat encounters worked terrifically to challenge me in all the right ways. While I wish the adventure didn’t end so soon, as a reaper of souls I should know: nothing lasts forever. "
230,"Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector ",8.0,"Black Lab Games, the studio behind Battlestar Galactica: Deadlock, has another hit on its hands with Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector. While it’s in danger of being overlooked amid a recent flood of games using the Warhammer 40K setting, Battlesector brings the new era of the 40K tabletop game to the PC like a thunder hammer to the head of a hive tyrant. The momentum-based tactical system and broad customizability of the forces you lead, combined with randomization in the mission setups, gives you a fun campaign with a tasty side dish of multiplayer skirmish. The brooding melodrama of the Warhammer 40K universe is on full display in Battlesector, much to its credit. The beautiful, yet burdened Blood Angels Space Marines are devastated following the invasion of their home worlds by the ravening swarm of the Tyranids, a hive mind of space monsters that exist only to eat and grow. However, the Blood Angels have now been reinforced by the newly made Primaris Marines (which are like normal Space Marines but bigger) and are ready for a counter-attack.  Battlesector explains all the Lord Primarch and Baalfora and Hive Fleet convolutions as well as it can. Just drink it up, because it's all background to your team of Tyranid hunters on a barren, salt-desert moon. As you might expect – nay, demand – from a Space Marine adventure, there are lots of scenery-chewing voice performances and plenty of melodramatic inter-character conflict to enjoy. It all delights in dialogue and flavor text that really catches the tone of 40k. My only real complaint is that while the Primaris serve as a catalyst for new things happening in the 40K universe, they barely have an on-screen presence or a handful of lines between them all. Over a 20-mission single-player campaign, you lead Sergeant Carleon and his Blood Angels, along with some Sister of Battle allies, against the Tyranids. To their credit, no two missions are exactly alike, each presenting some new objective or terrain to set it apart from the others. Early fights see you tearing through Tyranids on desolate salt flats, while later battles move to narrow mountain passes and massive gothic industrial facilities. Each of these hand-crafted mission battle maps is a pleasure to fight over because they all present interesting tactical choices. Those choices become gloriously rich over the course of the campaign. As you unlock new units to use you're able to put points into your commander’s skill trees – but you've got no hope of unlocking them all in a single playthrough. Instead, you get to specialize your army, choosing which units you'll buff up with new skills and upgraded stats. In my roughly 30 hours with Battlesector, I’ve built two armies: One designed as an infantry gun-line that buffs up its members and mows down enemies as they approach, then has heroes sweep in to melee the survivors to mulch. The other is led by an armored sledgehammer, using flamethrower-equipped Furioso Dreadnought to burn out the chaff and Predator tanks to smash the big bugs before they can even react. Both builds have a different feel and are effective ways to play through the campaign, which speaks well to its potential for replays. Skirmish is a bit more barebones. Fights are on mirrored maps with no real objectives other than a deathmatch, but it's fun enough to think up weird lists of units to surprise others with. Playing as the Tyranids after the shooting-and-maneuvering campaign as the Blood Angels is a treat because they force you to focus on swarm tactics and high-value centerpiece monsters to win. The only real limitation is the unit variety – about 13 units per side – which left me wanting more. Also, you can't customize your armies' appearance. Forgivable in the campaign, with its canonical color schemes, but a sad exclusion in multiplayer. I've said it before and I'll say it again: All Warhammer games should have an army painter. The basic turn-to-turn tactics of Battlesector are pretty richly simulated, with each unit having a number of attacks each round, each with its own chance to hit and damage roll. It's pretty satisfying to see a unit of Primaris Aggressors roll out 120 separate attacks in a turn, scything through model after model of Tyranids. Otherwise, most units move up to a set distance and can take a single action each round, aside from heroic HQ units that can take two actions. As you maneuver, you set your units' facings and set any units which haven't acted or are holding fire to an overwatch position so they can fire during the enemy turn. Facing also determines how enemies interact with them: you can rush past the undefended flanks or rear of an enemy, for example, without them getting a free melee attack on you. The melee rules are the most complex thing to figure out, highly dependent on what weapons each side is using and whether or not they're doing a Charge action into the fight. It might take you some trial and error before you understand when your units will or won't get free attacks with pistol weapons against an onrushing horde, or avoid those same kinds of attacks from the enemy, because the tutorials aren’t as clear as they could be when it comes to explaining the system. Either way, most combat is about positioning your units at their optimal range, which is conveniently highlighted for you when you mouse over a weapon. However, not all weapons’ statistics are as clearly and intuitively displayed. Heaven help you if it's an enemy's weapon you’re seeking information on. But fear not! It's a strategy game UI, people – stick with it and you'll figure out the stupid quirks eventually. As your units mow down the enemy they rack up points in their Momentum bar, which brings a high-skill, high-reward factor to Battlesector's combat. You could ignore it, or just use it when you luck into it, but it's really fun once you figure it out. Blood Angels generate Momentum by being in the thick of the fight, while Tyranids get it for killing, but both sides use it the same ways: a full Momentum bar lets a unit either take an extra action that round or use a buffed-up version of one of their abilities, like a super-strength heal or a meteoric aerial charge. It's a little icing on the cake during combat, a bit of a minigame to gun for as you maximize your favorite units and ensure they get the choicest kills so they can get extra attacks. Perhaps the best part of Battlesector is that it doesn't shy away from big, huge, swirling battlefields filled with units. At the biggest army sizes you end up with 20 units on the field, all armed to the teeth. These colossal battles can take over an hour to resolve but they're thrilling to play out on the bigger maps, encouraging you to fight on several fronts. I love splitting my army into two or three detachments designed to operate independently, which is something from tabletop Warhammer I've rarely seen represented in video games. Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector beats the pants off of other recent 40K tactical games, making a run at skirmish wargame greatness. While it's limited in places and the interface can struggle, the tactical combat is well worth the time it takes to learn and the Momentum system rewards your strategic prowess with more capacity to dish out pain. From the diverse campaign missions to the straightforward skirmishes, I not only recommend Battlesector, but hope that it does well enough to warrant the addition of many new factions in DLC and expansions. "
231,Wildermyth ,9.0,"The supremely ambitious indie RPG Wildermyth aims to combine the best of storytelling with the best of procedural generation. It surprisingly succeeds, thanks to great writing, solid tactics, and some very clever design decisions that emphasize how adventure is all about legacy. It may not look like much at a glance, but anyone interested in good stories in games should look deeper. The grand dream of the role-playing game is combining the flexibility and creativity of having a human game master who can react to player decisions and tell stories with the speed and convenience of playing single-player on a computer or console. It's a pursuit that has led to some of the great innovations in the genre, like early BioWare's development of fully fleshed-out companions or Fallout's responsiveness to our choices.  It's also a dream that can never be achieved (barring some terrifying breakthrough in AI), but that makes the ambitious attempts all the more exciting when they make baby steps of progress. Worldwalker Games' story-centered tactical RPG Wildermyth is as ambitious as games like Pathfinder: Kingmaker or Alpha Protocol – but with far fewer glaring flaws to look past. It's one of those games that captures that lightning in a bottle. Describing Wildermyth in broad strokes can make it sound like a conventional RPG. First, you pick from one of a small set of campaigns, which can either be randomly generated or have a pre-written main plot. This opens with a party of three or four randomized or customizable characters being launched on the path to adventure. These origin stories are usually well-told; the intro in the tutorial with the character who became my spellcasting Mystic, Fern, reading a book and then having that book become part of her life stuck with me through the entire campaign and beyond. After that, they pick their classes, learn to fight, and roll into the main campaign map. There's then a rhythm of exploring a new zone, participating in a randomly selected and procedurally flexible short story that develops the characters and the world, a combat mission assaulting the enemies you find there, and then consolidation of your gains in a way that grants the party upgrades. After enough of those, it's back to a plot mission to the end chapter. This campaign structure is a solid, if occasionally repetitive foundation for a game – and that repetition is probably my single biggest criticism of Wildermyth. But it’s mitigated by several exceptionally clever and well-crafted elements of the overall design. The first of these is that the writing is, well, really good. Each section of the story is told with a little comic book-style cutscene, and Wildermyth uses those creatively to grant the illusion of movement. In a touch that reminded me of the way Metal Gear Solid 5 starts its levels by crediting the designer, Wildermyth includes a title screen for each short story that includes the author’s name. These vignettes can range from the somewhat generic for setting up a fight – a character falls down a hole and the other party members have to decide how to save her – to the intensely mythic, like a mysterious giant shape passing in the night, granting the party a reputation bonus simply for being able to tell the story of what happened in bars and at festivals for the rest of their lives. More than that, however, the writing is flexible. Each character in your party has three important character traits, like being a dreamer or a weirdo or having potential or carrying a lot of shame. These personality traits are used in stories in ways that have the characters reacting to events in the proper ways, and some stories seem to be set up to only pop up when characters of specific traits are in the party. The presence of certain traits means that even when you’re seeing the same stories multiple times, they can feel different based on which characters are involved. Another fun effect is occasional character transformations as campaigns progress. I've had characters grow wings from meeting capricious wanderers, start turning into gemstones based on their greed, or commune with a fire spirit and have their body start to turn to flame. Character relationships are important, too – those default to friendship, but Wildermyth can toss some familial relationships at you, and either your choices or random events can lead to romantic entanglements or rivalries, both of which add some fun storytelling spice beyond the preset traits. That spice isn't just in the plot, though. Both of those possibilities grant tactical buffs: rivalries cause pairs of characters to inflict more critical hits (called Stunts in Wildermyth's system) as the two compete in battle like Gimli and Legolas, while romances mean characters deal extra damage after their lover gets hit. Transformations have neat effects too, both adjusting the party member's stats and giving them exciting skills, like my flame-handed Mystic having the ability to shoot streams of fire from her hands at will. Wildermyth's responsiveness to what happens in its campaigns is also one of its traits that brings the whole game together. Some of this is stylistic; Wildermyth uses a flexible paper doll system for its character models, kind of like a less grimdark Darkest Dungeon, and each face can age, get magically corrupted, or become scarred if characters are defeated in combat. Each body can be customized for height, size, gender and presentation, hair, face, and colors in a surprisingly effective manner given the apparent simplicity of the art style. And the cartoonishly exaggerated items like magical swords or spiked shoulderpads you find along your quest all tend to pop up remarkably nicely, even on the combat screen. It can take a bit to get used to (and paper dolls’ heads tilting to look up never quite works), but it's a very clever way for an indie game to grant the illusion of having the resources to let you do whatever you want with your party members. Over the course of a campaign, which is probably about 10-15 hours depending on difficulty, your characters will evolve from looking like some peasants who picked up the most convenient items at hand to defend themselves, to a tough soldier or hunter, to a legendary hero of yore, with billowing capes, colorful armor, magical body modifications, and unique mythic bows or axes. They’ll find themselves fighting alongside similarly decked-out best friends or husbands or children, all for the fate of the world. The progression feels natural, like an RPG should feel, and that goes a long way. It's a rare game where I'd barely mention combat until this late in a review, but Wildermyth is a very rare game indeed. Its turn-based tactical RPG battles feel perfunctory initially; playing the tutorial campaign on default difficulty tends to involve little more than moving to a monster, hitting it, and not overextending in order to win. But as I played longer campaigns – and increased the difficulty – I found a surprising depth emerging from Wildermyth. One extremely clever aspect of the campaigns is that after every combat, yes, your characters improve thanks to experience… but so do the monsters. A card that gets drawn could add a new more powerful enemy to future battles, or increase the health or armor or damage of an existing foe. As my campaigns progressed, so too did those enemy buffs, in ways that could cascade somewhat out of control. This, combined with tough-but-fair higher difficulties, meant my autopiloting through combat was replaced by intensely tactical battles. One fight saw my team caught between two large sets of enemies on a town street; it was only a tactical retreat into the nearest building with my best character, a Warrior, in the front, and my fire Mystic tossing dancing flames around that gave me a chance to get out without losing characters. I had gone into Wildermyth as though it were a game where the combat largely existed to help pace a storytelling experience – and it can be that if that's what you want – but it becomes a strong tactical RPG on its own if you ask it to dance. Surprising depth is the name of the game on the plot side as well, with two major conceits providing the rugs that tie the room together. The first is time. Each campaign is divided into several chapters, and those chapters take place years apart. Both within and in between those chapters, characters age and time passes. It's a similar conceit to Double Fine's generation-based Massive Chalice, but with far more complexity and nuance between fights. As I played Wildermyth, the game that kept popping into my mind as one of its closest parallels was 1992's Darklands, arguably the biggest ambitious failure in CRPG history (though it's available on GOG). Like Darklands, Wildermyth involves generations of heroes meandering through dense worlds, building reputations and having stories come from the world responding to our choices. There are differences, notably Wildermyth's more traditional setting and reputation being built in-party, but it scratches the same itches that the idea of Darklands always did for me. Play the first chapter and your fresh-faced youngsters will learn and grow a bit, but by the second chapter a decade may have passed and they’re getting some salt-and-pepper in their hair and a few wrinkles to distinguish them. Another chapter later and they're married with children and ennui about adventuring. They can die, get maimed, or retire during story events – I had one character become a seer who prevented future enemy invasions, but that came at the cost of losing her from my party. And as the campaign draws to its end, they'll often retire and let the next generation take over – although you can make some decisions or build stats that let them stick around longer than normal. The aging creates a double-edged sword in a Wildermyth campaign: playing as a completionist makes your characters stronger, but it also makes them older and more likely to retire when you need them most. It also ties into that visual sense of progress. Yeah, Fern is looking cooler and cooler, and those gray hairs make her look like Rogue from the X-Men, and her entire body is turning to flame, but she may hang it all up after this chapter! This is a tension that could create a certain level of decision fatigue, but Wildermyth has one final trick up its sleeve. It’s a meta-concept that doesn't just make everything work, it makes it work brilliantly. See, Wildermyth is all about legacy. It's about stories and the knowledge that those stories may or may not be true, but they'll ring through the generations regardless. The interface is built around the idea of books, of telling and retelling. Books and libraries and oral history are crucial to many of the cutscenes, starting with that tutorial character getting her powers directly from reading a book. The characters realize they're in stories, in a sense, but in a way that makes it feel more mythic (most of the time, at least – occasionally an easy joke slips through). It’s telling that the main currency in the campaign isn't gold or some monetary stand-in, it's ""Legacy Points,"" which can be spent on recruiting new characters or buying materials for gear upgrades or preventing enemy buffs. More importantly, characters who retire or finish a campaign aren't simply done: they become part of ""My Legacy,"" a sort of trophy rack of characters for both examination and for further use. Characters who die can also be buried in tombs that add them to your Legacy as well – I had one character I’d gone through a long quest to recruit who’d died quickly after, but his daughter showed up 20 years later. She eventually died as well, but she was so cool and the story around her was enticing enough that I added her to the Legacy, and now Yovanna Slenderskirt is a character who pops up in my stories again and again. That's right: Legacy characters can and will be pulled from that rack to play a role in other campaigns. Their levels are lowered a bit so they're not overpowered, and they can be de-aged depending on campaign need, but it’s definitely still them. The Legacy characters also feel mythic. That sense of progress in gear and their individual storylines tying together makes them look and feel cooler than the newly generated characters of any campaign. They're given terms like ""Folk Hero"" or ""Local Legend,"" and it rings true – not just in how they're slightly more powerful in a tactical sense, but also in how their stories change a bit every time. In the tutorial campaign, my lead Warrior, Wynbrec, was a boisterous friend to the main characters; in the next campaign he popped up in, he's an expert warrior where that boisterousness makes him seem like kind of a jerk to the kids he ends up befriending. He was a fun sidekick when I didn't already know him, but became an inscrutable wanderer once he'd developed a reputation. This lack of canonicity to the storytelling, the elevated, legendary tone of the stories, and the effects of time, choice, and gear on the character models all add up to your Legacy characters feeling less like straightforward regular people within the game world, and more like folk heroes like Johnny Appleseed or Wong Fei-hung, or superheroes like Batman. It matches how I see people talk about their procedural characters in games like XCOM or Darkest Dungeon. Wynbrec isn't just ""a warrior who can attack twice per turn,"" he's my first Warrior, the guy who defended a barn in his hometown against a horde of giant insects and befriended a critter who stole his lucky coin. Everyone in my game world should have stories about Wynbrec, even if they contradict one another! He rules! The magic of Wildermyth is that it loves stories so much that it builds its entire structure, from graphical style to prose to combat to campaign structure, around its characters becoming legends. It then cements those ideas in place with a Legacy system that turns those legendary characters into stories again, weaving design and storytelling together throughout. Wildermyth gives the impression of being charmingly ramshackle, but surprisingly flexible and tight under the hood, which all adds up to a truly special experience. "
232,The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD ,8.0,"After rolling credits on The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD on Nintendo Switch, I feel really good about my decision to spend 50+ hours revisiting the Zelda universe’s origin story, warts and all. I’ve always been a fan of this divisive Zelda, though unlike IGN’s reviewer in 2011, I never thought Skyward Sword could quite stand shoulder to shoulder with giants of the series like Ocarina of Time or The Wind Waker. Even so, it’s a great game, and much of what made it great has aged quite well especially in light of the quality of life improvements and updated graphics. The story and characters are still some of the best in the series and the side quests and weirdness of the world remains fantastic. On the other hand, no matter what you’re doing the gimmicky Wii-era motion control mechanics are still constantly right up in your face, reminding me why those never worked well, and some of the dungeons (and especially the boss fights) aren’t particularly challenging or memorable. But with so much to do and a lot to love, Skyward Sword’s journey down memory lane has kept me smiling the whole way through. I’ve always considered the visual style of Skyward Sword to be one of the best in the series, and the 1080p/60fps upgrade (docked - it’s 720p/60fps in handheld mode) makes the already lovable world of giant birds and creepy mole people all the more beautiful. It’s still not as detailed as Breath of the Wild, but it’s a massive improvement over the 480p/30fps (!) Wii version. Sailing the open desert as a time traveling pirate is bewitchingly beautiful, and the expressions on characters’ faces manage to convey a ton of emotion despite using an art style that’s minimalistic by today’s standards.  Creating an origin story for a beloved series that’s had a fairly disjointed plot is no small task, but Skyward Sword sticks the landing with ease. Every character is extremely memorable, whether it’s a heavy hitter like Zelda who’s more emotional and humanized than she’s ever been, or the goofy cast of side characters like Groose, the dumb jock with a heart of gold. Setting the stage for the events of every story that comes after it and creating an origin for the iconic Master Sword are already impressive feats on their own; the fact that Nintendo pulled it off without voice acting and created such an all-star cast in the process makes me wonder what Faustian bargain was struck to make that supernatural feat possible.  Following the typical dungeon-delving formula, you spend most of your time in Skyward Sword HD exploring colorful areas, collecting nifty new gadgets, and solving straightforward puzzles as you slice your way through all kinds of cartoonish monsters. Unique to Skyward Sword is that the four main hub worlds are reused heavily as you retrace your steps in your quest to save Zelda, gaining access to new parts of the world as you obtain new gear. The lack of variety is a little disappointing, but it’s not as repetitious as it sounds because world events sometimes change the landscapes over time and hidden areas reveal themselves during return visits. Even if they’re reused a tad too much, each of the hub worlds are diverse and full of personality and exploring them all can be a lot of fun. You’ll hunt for archeological secrets with a Goron, help some woodland weirdos reunite, and look for some interesting secrets and collectibles along the way. The main weakness of the hub worlds is that they tend to be fairly barren when it comes to enemies, which are sporadically placed and serve mostly as a minor annoyance rather than any real or worthwhile challenge. While I’m on the topic of running around: the stamina system in Skyward Sword is still very out of place and not good. It works in Breath of the Wild, where access to areas is limited by a stamina stat that you’re constantly raising, but in Skyward Sword it simply slows you down for no real reason. It’s also constantly making me feel like a wimp in combat when I run out of stamina then have to stop and pant for like 10 seconds while some moblins whale on me. The fact that you can’t increase your stamina or make the situation less annoying except by chugging potions like a drunken witch makes it even more annoying. If I were in charge of a Skyward Sword remaster and gameplay tweaks were on the table, I probably would have just removed the stamina system altogether. Nothing of value would be lost. Side quests aren’t a huge part of Skyward Sword HD, which is one of the more linear Zelda games, but the ones that are there are awesome. I flushed a jerk’s love letter right down the toilet then watched him cry about it, and seduced the item check lady right in front of her disapproving father. When dungeons and puzzles were wearing on me, it was nice to be able to fall back to the floating island of Skyloft and just get up to some good ol’ fashioned shenanigans, and Skyward Sword HD has got those in spades. Of course, dungeons in the Zelda series have always been the real meat and potatoes, and Skyward Sword mostly delivers in that regard. There are some absolutely fantastic highlights, like the time-shifting, pirate-themed sand dungeons, as well as some that are fairly forgettable, like the by-the-numbers Faron Woods areas that I feel like I’ve played a hundred times already across every Zelda game. That’s not to say that any of the dungeons are actively not fun to play – dungeons are easily the best part of any Zelda game and Skyward Sword HD is no exception. It’s more that you can only solve a puzzle whose solution is to shoot an arrow at an eyeball so many times before you’re like, “Okay. Can we get to the boss now, please?” Unfortunately, the boss fights are a little hit or miss as well, with repeated encounters throughout that are only slightly modified variations each time and become monotonous. A few are just forgettable, like the giant scorpion with eyeballs on his claws that could be used as a stock photo of a boss encounter. That said, there are also a few really stellar boss fights, especially in the back half of the adventure (which I won’t spoil here for those who haven’t played yet). When a satisfying dungeon filled with interesting puzzles and a memorable boss encounter come together it’s one of the most satisfying Zelda-specific feelings in all of gaming, and Skyward Sword HD does have quite a few. When it debuted in 2011, there was a lot of discussion around Skyward Sword’s heavy use of motion controls – and now, with the remaster offering both motion-based and thumbstick control options, that debate seems primed to reignite. Even with motion controls disabled, nearly every battle and puzzle incorporates the direction in which you swing Link’s trusty blade and you’re often asked to draw a symbol on a wall or some other task that was clearly built with the Wii Remote in mind. Using motion controls on the Switch, Skyward Sword feels very much on par with the original version, both good and bad. Swinging your detached Joy-con around at an enemy can be a lot of fun, but flapping your arms like a bird to get your Loftwing to fly higher is pretty annoying. And, naturally, when it occasionally doesn’t detect your movement correctly it’s just frustrating and not fun. There are a few moments in Skyward Sword HD, though, where motion controls feel absolutely perfect, like the rare moments where you thrust your sword into the ground during a cutscene or draw the outline of a sigil with your sword to perform a sealing ritual. Regardless of how you feel about motion controls during fights, these small, quick-time event-like interactions are satisfying and memorable. For those who typically aren’t into motion controls – a category in which I include myself – there’s an option to disable them altogether. Unfortunately, the replacement is every bit as much of a pain in the neck and doesn’t really solve the problem I have with the motion controls. It’s not that I hate exercise or swinging my arm around – it’s that I hate how unreliable they are. But the motion-free answer to this, which is the only way to play in handheld mode or on a Switch Lite (unless you buy another controller) is that the right joystick serves as a directional pointer that you flick around in place of swinging your arm, and there are just as many issues with that. For one, you actually have to flick the stick around for a swing to register, not move it slowly. If you do, Link merely draws back his sword in preparation for an attack – he’ll only swing it once you rapidly flick the stick in a direction. Because you can’t take your time to line up those inputs, this means you end up with the exact same issues of inaccuracy as you’d get from motion controls. Which is to say, it works ~80% of the time, but when it doesn’t work it gets old really fast. On top of that, the way the stick has to be moved makes sense on paper but can be a little counterintuitive in practice. For example, if an enemy is guarding to your right, my instincts tell me to input toward the left to hit his unguarded side. But flicking the stick to the left swings my sword from right to left and immediately gets blocked. Like playing with an inverted camera, in order to hit the enemy I have to do the opposite of what I naturally want to and move the joystick to the right so that Link will swing his sword from left to right and hit the enemy’s unguarded side. I might've chalked this up to a problem unique to my broken brain, but another IGN staffer had the exact same issue trying to swing the sword in the intended direction. At the very least it takes a few hours for the unintuitively strange controls to start feeling natural. In fact, I ultimately ended up switching back to motion controls because at least then I knew which way to swing the controller to get the desired result more naturally. That’s a huge miss for people like me who were hoping for a more reliable option, or for people who pick up Skyward Sword for the first time only to be presented with two less-than-ideal options. To be fair, motion controls are so baked into Skyward Sword’s DNA that there might well be no good way to get around the problem no matter what, but either way the route Nintendo landed on is disappointing. The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword will be remembered for revitalizing a franchise that had, for a time, seemingly settled for being merely great instead of revolutionary. Once again, Nintendo is demonstrating its unparalleled ability to craft some of the greatest gameplay this industry has ever seen. Remarkably, this Zelda game manages to reshape its control scheme, design sensibility and pacing all at once while still telling a brilliantly powerful story featuring some very memorable characters. Increasingly Nintendo refuses to compromise cinematic storytelling for gameplay, finding a balance that seems effortless. On the bright side, Skyward Sword HD adds the ability to fully control the camera, which was absent in the Wii version, but the caveat here is that it uses the same joystick as your sword in motion-free mode. Since you use the right thumbstick to control the camera normally, when that stick is occupied serving as your sword arm, you instead need to hold down L to move the camera then release it to regain control of your sword, which can be a bit clunky. Still, it’s a welcome addition, and if you’re playing with motion controls (as I ended up doing most of the time) then it’s a huge improvement over the Wii version.  Aside from these major changes, there’s also a bunch of little quality-of-life stuff that wasn’t in the original, like skippable dialogue and cutscenes, autosaves, tutorials at the beginning that are now optional, and no more repeated item explanations every single time you pick something up. These are great changes that genuinely add up to make a noticeably smoother experience – although, there is one bizarre one in their midst: the not-insignificant new ability to instantly return to the sky at any time is inexplicably locked behind owning a specific Amiibo. Why? Because Nintendo, that’s why! Skyward Sword remains as charming as ever, even if it’s also still dominated by clunky controls and odd gimmicks that are exactly as weird as you remember them. The characters and story have aged like fine wine, the quality of life improvements help alleviate some of the Wii-era wonkiness, and the improved graphics and performance make this version look and play better than ever. Unsolved control issues aside, this airborne adventure is everything you might expect it to be, for better or worse, and playing through it again had me grinning ear-to-ear the whole way through. "
233,Old World ,8.0,"We've seen plenty of 4X games that try to tackle the whole scope of human history, or our distant future among the stars. But Old World zooms in both on time and space, creating what is still a suitably epic story based exclusively around the ancient Mediterranean. In most ways, it benefits from this narrower focus, telling more intimate and less abstract stories about human society than its ancestors in the Civilization series could. At the same time, it manages to feel a fair bit more complicated and unwieldy in the process. At least at first. Old World is like a post-graduate program for players who already have a bachelor's degree in Sid Meier's Civilization. Despite covering a much smaller slice of history, it takes the Civ template as a starting point and layers a lot of new mechanics on top of it. And for the most part, they're pretty interesting twists. But they're often presented in ways that aren't immediately elegant or approachable. The most prominent of these is a system of named characters and aristocratic families which adds a sort of ""Crusader Kings Lite"" dynamic to your internal and international politics.  One issue I always had with the Civilization series was that you sprinted through the ages so quickly that a lot of the relatable, human aspects of history could get lost in the mix. With each turn representing a year or a half-year in Old World, and leaders who grow old and die in realistic time frames, I really got to know and develop feelings for the various generals and court functionaries through scripted events and decisions. In my first game as the Macedonian Greeks, Alexander was blinded in a military training exercise as a child and went on to be a wise administrator rather than a ravenous conqueror. His grandson would forge a peace with the Gauls by marrying one of their tattooed warriors, but upset some of the more xenophobic nobles in the process. The events are generally well-written, making it easy to understand what's going on and what your options are. I also rarely felt like there was one choice that was clearly better than the others, which is a difficult balancing act to pull off. More than once, I was asked to pick between something that would benefit the whole nation but upset one or more of the major noble families, or show a little favoritism to keep a potential rival from getting too rebellious. Compared to Crusader Kings 3, these events are a bit simpler and less likely to have multiple steps, but have just as much potential to majorly affect your plans, like Alexander's little accident did. I was less thrilled by the consequences for failing to balance these internal concerns, though. The one time I did annoy one of my noble families enough to cause a revolt, they simply spawned a few units of rebels without much fanfare and I was able to put them down quite easily without much lasting harm. Some of that was luck – my best army was close to home rather than away on campaign. But it still felt a bit anticlimactic. It's more interesting thinking about how to prevent a revolt than it is to actually put one down. Since every city you found must be awarded to one of the four noble families, you have to think about whether you want to keep their power bases spread out and balkanized, or clustered so they're easier to pin down. This can be a lot to get your head around, and while there is a decent tutorial and a nested tooltip system, the UI didn't do me a lot of favors there. It likes to present information in a very dense, text-heavy way that seems afraid to cover up too much of the map, even when doing so could have given each detail some much needed breathing room and improved readability by a lot. I found myself constantly wishing for proper character screens like in Crusader Kings 2 and 3 instead of the cramped little frames we got. Making more use of icons, tabs, or collapsible info panes rather than assaulting us with so much plain text per tooltip would have gone a long way as well. The other major departure from Civilization is a resource called orders, which determines how much your entire civilization can do on a given turn. While individual units still have a movement range and action limit, you can run out of orders and not be able to use all of them. So a very spread-out empire without enough administrative buildings may find that they have to choose between giving orders to their troops at home to put down a rebellion or maneuvering against a rival in a foreign war. You often can’t do it all, and deciding where to spend your attention and what to ignore is commonly an interesting decision. Overall, I liked the way this allowed smaller, ""tall"" empires to compete with sprawling and inefficient ones and modeled the difficulties of commanding a vast, ancient state. But it is also one more resource to juggle on top of all of the usual ones you'd expect in Civ, so at the same time, it contributes to the increased complexity I mentioned earlier. While the menus may get overly busy, the map looks excellent and presents a lot of useful information at a glance. It might not be quite as high fidelity as Civ 6 or the upcoming Humankind, but the units and buildings are a bit less exaggerated and stylized, so I feel more like I'm looking at a real place and not at a game board. And that's a pretty big deal for me. On the other hand, the world generation looks a little bit off sometimes. I always seem to spawn near a bunch of volcanoes regardless of my settings, and the placement of eco regions like deserts can feel slightly arbitrary. But if you don't want to leave things up to chance, there are also handcrafted maps of the Mediterranean and the Middle East with historical start locations. The cities you place down on these rolling hills and sprawling plains will develop culturally through four different levels, which determines what you can build within their limits. Technology is still required to unlock certain things, but this serves as an interesting replacement for the idea of different ages or eras in other 4X games. Rather than progressing as an entire society, each of your cities might be at a different tier, with new colonies and outlying settlements lagging behind the urban core of the capital socially and technologically. I really liked the way this shaped my empire both in terms of visual variety and gameplay, allowing me to see a clear difference between pastoral farming areas and highly developed industrial ones. The wars you'll fight across these maps are definitely a highlight of Old World. And unlike the other new features, they add a lot of depth without adding much complexity. Axemen have a cleave that can deal reduced damage to anyone close to their primary target. Simple. Cavalry get to attack again if they kill a unit. Spearmen are the only guys that can stop cavalry in their tracks, as mounted units normally ignore zone of control rules. None of these abilities require multiple paragraphs of text to understand or come with an armload of edge cases, but the possibilities for using them in concert are great, much like a game of chess. And the AI is generally much more capable of understanding and employing those ideas than anything I've seen in Civ 6, even after its years of patches. This is also where Old World's final new resource comes in: training. This is generated by military buildings and leaders, and is used both to train and rank up military units. Since unit promotions can use training in place of experience, you can choose to have a smaller, more elite army instead of a larger one. Training can also be spent on a turn-by-turn basis to get extra orders or force march a unit beyond their normal range, so I rarely ran out of ways to use it to squeeze out a bit of an extra advantage in combat if I had any to spare. Old World's victory conditions are a bit on the underwhelming side. The main, proactive way to triumph is by completing a certain number of periodically offered objectives called Ambitions, which can be anything from capturing a certain number of enemy cities to building enough of a specific tile improvement. Failing this, you fall back to a scoring system based mostly on how many cities you have and how developed they are, which gives the win either to the first nation to reach a set number or whoever has the most when a certain number of turns is reached. I didn't mind this too much since the events and character interactions make Old World much more about the journey than the destination, but some more variety in goals to pursue wouldn't have hurt. On your way to the end, you can shape your society with some interesting and flavorful choices of laws and religious beliefs. Legal innovations are unlocked by technology and present a binary choice between two paths, such as Slavery vs Freedom or Monotheism vs Polytheism. Having a professional army will give a trickle of training points at all times, for instance, while a volunteer army will give you a larger number per turn while at war but none while at peace. In most cases, both choices are simple, compelling, and seem to do a pretty good job of simulating the historical ideas they are meant to represent. Old World can be vexing at first given how much more there is to manage on top of the usual 4X concerns we’ve gotten used to in the past decade or so, and the UI can feel cluttered as you're trying to piece it all together. But crucially, none of that added complexity comes without added rewards. The richness and human element that mortal characters and noble families bring is well worth coming to grips with all of the extra mechanics they introduce. Limiting your ability to give orders not only cuts down on long turn times in the late game, but opens up new strategies for playing tall or making the most of a less than great start position. It’s a fine balancing act, and while Old World doesn’t really become a ""Civ killer,"" I don't think it's trying to be. For those who have the patience to master it, it's a satisfying and deep 4X that could generate interesting stories for ages to come. "
234,oguebook ,7.0,"I’ve spent a lot of my gaming time over the last five plus years duking it out against all manner of foes using the most powerful weapon of them all… cards. And in that time, two of my favourite card-based battle games have been Faeria and Slay the Spire. With Roguebook, those worlds are colliding. Well, to be more precise, developer Abrakam has brought its Faeria universe across to the roguelike deck-builder genre and created something of a (literal) storybook take on Slay the Spire. Roguebook doesn’t quite reach the same dizzying gameplay heights as that game, but it has a lot to offer, from its clever dual hero battle system and gorgeous presentation, through to its puzzle-like overworlds that are built around the premise that you’re trapped within Faeria’s lore book. One of Roguebook’s most interesting points of differentiation is its overworld exploration. Every map starts out with large swathes of blank parchment and it’s only by using brushes and ink pots that you can reveal what’s on each tile. As you paint, you’ll come across opportunities to draft more cards, to transmute existing cards, and to build up your in-battle energy reserves. You’ll discover piles of gold that can be spent at each chapter’s shop, you’ll collect relics that can potentially power up your gameplan, and you'll stumble upon standalone events and mythical creatures. Working out how to best gather and use ink makes for an absorbing layer of overworld strategy.  Each enemy encounter, meanwhile, is an opportunity to test the cards, abilities, buffs and modifiers you’ve cobbled together so far. How well does your strategy fit together, and are you taking full advantages of the two heroes you’d chosen at the start of the run? Can you deal with multiple foes or work around status effects? And do you have enough lethality to topple enemies that steadily build their power? There’s generally a lot to keep in mind, especially as the row of relics and talents at the top of the screen gets longer and longer. These perks, after all, fundamentally inform your choice of cards to draft, as well as how to approach any given fight. If you have the relic Sturdy Shell, for instance, it gives the equipped hero five block each time he or she takes damage. If an enemy’s looking to attack for low damage repeatedly, then, you’ll want to end your turn with that hero at the front to basically negate the damage. With blocking taken care of, this also means you can prioritise attacking or deploying allies that turn. If you have the relic Flame of Ignus, you’ll get an extra energy orb any time a card grants you one, which means you should aggressively draft cards that do just that – as well as more expensive cards and card draw, as you know you’ll be able to take advantage of them. Even the cards in your deck can be modified thanks to Roguebook’s gem system. You may want to reduce a card’s cost, add card draw or perhaps always start a battle with it a particular card in hand. Cleverly utilising gems can have a massive impact on your deck’s power level and I really enjoyed looking for build-defining synergies. Roguebook’s turn-based battle system has many layers. Like Slay the Spire, you’ll spend energy to play cards, you’ll point attacks that do damage at enemies and you’ll find ways to build up block to mitigate incoming damage. More uniquely, you’ll also deploy allies into the battlefield – some of which offer up unique benefits like returning a card to hand or letting you swap hero positions, while others simply do damage at the end of every turn. The design element I find most compelling, however, is the front and back dynamic for the two heroes. Swapping their positions is baked into many of the cards - cast one of Sharra’s Defend cards to gain block, for instance, and she’ll move to the front. Cards with Charge do the same, while cards with Retreat send the hero to the back. Swapping heroes is also regularly used to avoid position-specific debuffs and to trigger effects, while ending the turn with a particular hero at the front is a big part of the strategy as they’re the one that will take any damage. Some heroes utilise a specific position well too. Being at the front gives Sharra a boost to her attack power, for instance, but if she’s paired with Seifer you may want to end turns with him in the lead. Not only does he have higher native health, but any damage he takes adds to his rage meter which, when full, allows him to play a supercharged version of one of his cards. Swapping positions is also a big part of gaining incremental resource advantages. Melee cards, for instance, cost one less when played by a hero who is leading, while Ranged cards are the same for the rear position. Weaving these discounts in while also paying attention to other keywords like Combo (which drops the cost of the Combo card by one if you play a card from the other hero first) is integral to making the most of your turns. Each hero also has strengths, weaknesses and unique mechanics to be aware of. Sharra, for example, can generate Daggers, which are essentially zero cost damage spells. She also has plenty of strong single target attack cards and can cause ongoing bleed in enemies. Sorocco’s cards, meanwhile, are generally a little more expensive but hit harder. He’s more focused on AOE, on boosting the power of heroes and on generating block – and sometimes turning it into damage. As mentioned, Seifer has the rage mechanic, so has cards that generate rage or take advantage of rage, as well as ways to sacrifice health and then heal back up. He can also deploy aggressive allies and then bolster their attack… or sacrifice them to save his own hide. The last hero is Aurora, a low health, spell-casting tortoise who can summon an army of frogs, which all stack atop one another to create a single heavy-hitting ally. Many of her cards are either concerned with her health or are dual-sided. Sip is an example of both, healing for four if Aurora is damaged, but dealing four to the lead enemy if not. Sips are generated through a host of support cards, and Aurora also has plenty of card draw tools. Building a winning deck with cards from two distinct pools is quite fun, but Roguebook’s heroes aren’t all that mechanically interesting. I didn’t want to explore Seifer’s rage mechanic in the same way I became obsessed with orb strategies for the Defect in Slay the Spire, for instance. Many of Roguebook’s best ideas feel game-wide rather than hero-driven. Compounding this, having cards from two heroes in your deck makes aiming for a narrow strategy particularly difficult. You’re rewarded for having more cards in your deck too, with new talent choices unlocked at certain thresholds, and this is very much a mixed blessing. With this style of game, the more cards you draft, the more watered down your strategy will inevitably become. Deciding how large your deck should be is an interesting push and pull each run, but having rewards tied to larger decks doesn’t necessarily make Roguebook a better game. After you beat Roguebook once you’ll get access to New Run +. This Epilogue has 15 levels of difficulty to work through, and a whole host of modifiers to unlock – and then select – that will radically alter each run. Your lead hero might take damage each time he or she plays a card, for instance, or the back enemy may always start stealthed. It’s an interesting approach, but I found myself wishing each row was unlocked at once, as opposed to unlocking each modifier individually, as some were much more appealing to attempt than others. The higher the Epilogue level you clear, the more Pages you’re rewarded, and these are spent on significant meta game upgrades like boosting the starting health of your heroes, adding more energy wells to each map and increasing the likelihood of rarer cards or treasures dropping. For the most part the embellishments help make you more powerful for future runs, but you may want to think twice before unlocking some of the options. Randomising the cards in your starter deck, for instance, certainly has high roll potential, but it can also leave you at a disadvantage. There’s something to be said for starting with a vanilla deck that’s reliable enough in the early game and that you then build on, while transmuting away the weaker cards over time. New Game + represents significant endgame component, but it’s still a shame Roguebook doesn’t have anything outside of it. I’d have loved an additional palate cleanser mode, like daily challenges or the ability to create custom runs for fun in which I build my own starter deck, swap starter relics and so on. Roguebook also has a few issues to clear up. I encountered numerous bugs in my time with the game, from cards not working as intended through to a run in which one of my hero’s starter relics simply went AWOL. I also lost a few hours progress at one point thanks to an issue with cloud save functionality. Thankfully, the game has already received a couple of significant patches, including one after the bulk of my playtime, so things are heading in the right direction.   Roguebook’s positional gameplay makes for a really fun combat puzzle, but the downside of the two hero system is that player strategy feels less focused than the best the genre has to offer. I enjoyed trying to combine hero abilities in unexpected ways, but the bespoke hero mechanics often weren’t compelling enough to really elevate that. Even so, Roguebook is an entertaining new take on the deck-builder genre, and its new ideas and lovingly realised world make it well worth a look. "
235,F1 2021 ,8.0,"The world of F1 was set to be transformed this year, thanks to the prospect of radical new regulations and cars. However, like so many things during the pandemic, the changes were delayed until 2022 – leaving F1 in a 12-month holding pattern. The real-life 2021 season seemed poised to offer few surprises, but the reality is that this season has so far been the most interesting championship in years. Funnily enough, it’s this backdrop that Codemasters has found itself competing against with its own fictional drama, introducing a fully-fledged story mode to F1 2021 for the first time in the series. The end result falls a little short of being as dramatic as the real thing, but it’s a well-executed and welcome new way to play that joins the series’ wide array of existing modes and makes for another excellent package – albeit one that needs a bit of extra content to bring it in line with the real-life 2021 season.  Codemasters flirted with the concept of a story mode two years ago in F1 2019 with its brief, F2-themed intro and its curated set of late-race scenarios and first-person cutscenes. There, however, it was simply a short sequence of events bolted onto the beginning of the standard career experience. In F1 2021 the story is a standalone mode akin to The Journey from FIFA 17 to 19, or Fight Night Champion’s titular Champion Mode – although it’s never quite as sentimental as the former or as rousing as the latter. Dubbed Braking Point, F1 2021’s story focuses on a pair of very different drivers: rookie Aiden Jackson, a talented Brit who still has some key things to learn about the F1 paddock, and Casper Akkerman, a Dutch journeyman with an illustrious career that’s mostly behind him. Depending on your choice, Jackson and Akkerman will race for one of five selectable teams – Williams, Haas, Alfa Romeo, Alpha Tauri, and Racing Point (which becomes Aston Martin during the story). These fictional drivers will unseat the real-life drivers in your choice of team, but the rest of the grid will be made up of actual F1 stars from the 2020 and 2021 seasons – except for one. Another driver from one of the four remaining selectable teams will be replaced with Codemasters’ resident F1 reptile, Devon Butler, who returns from his brief appearance as the antagonist at the beginning of F1 2019 for a slightly bigger role this time around. Braking Point also ignores the COVID-19 crisis that had a huge impact on the 2020 and 2021 F1 seasons and includes races which never happened – which is a little incongruous if you dwell on it – but I did quite enjoy how it temporarily turns back the clock to revisit 2020’s car and driver combinations. Watching Ricciardo change from Renault to McLaren and Renault change from… Renault to Alpine reminded me a little of the multi-season nature of the fan favourite F1 Challenge '99-'02 (known as F1 Career Challenge on consoles). Coincidentally enough, that was actually the last F1 game published by EA before this one. Sadly, you can’t start the standard career modes a few seasons ago in the same way as Braking Point, but there have been a lot of other tweaks to these modes that I found welcome as a returning player of many years. The ability to run quick, automated practice programs from a selection of tabs is a great addition, since they really had become quite a grind. It feels far, far better than skipping them outright, sacrificing the resource points, and diving straight into qualifying – which I’ve been tempted to do regularly over the last couple of years. I found the new option to leave the R&amp;D to the AI useful also, even though the R&amp;D system has had a nice facelift. Facility building can also be automated, but I stayed in charge of that to make sure the AI didn’t blow all my cash before I had a chance to lure Danny Ric to my team a few seasons in. F1 2021 also introduces a new Expert setting that allows you to really fine-tune the career experience to suit the pace you want to play at. You can still toggle assists on and calibrate the AI to your own needs, but selecting the Expert environment opens up a raft of options, including the severity of mechanical faults you might suffer, the rate at which you and the AI teams accumulate resource points and cash, and how damage is calculated. You can accelerate your rise to the pinnacle of F1 or make it incredibly, incredibly hard; it’s up to you. Damage deserves an additional mention because it’s much more nuanced than ever before, which improves the racing by dialling up the consequences. Damage to your floor, barge boards, or side pods, for instance, will create drag and have a noticeable effect on your top speed. Tyre damage is more convincing, too; brush a wall too heavily and it’s possible for tyres to become completely delaminated, with the belt ripped from the sidewall. While the novelty has worn off slightly after bursting onto the scene in F1 2020, My Team is still a brilliant mode, and Codemasters has done well to prune some the ageing cutscenes that clashed with the fact you’re actually the team owner (although there are still celebratory vignettes here that are at least five or six years old by now). The livery editing is very limited by modern standards, though, and it’d be great if sponsor decals only vanished from your car if you chose not to re-sign them. As it stands, every time sponsor contracts expire you still have to go and manually place their decals back on your car. It’s a weird annoyance considering everything else is so streamlined. F1 2021 also introduces a pair of brand new two-player career modes, where you can link up with a friend to play as either rivals or teammates (Contracts mode allows both players to independently sign up with the team of their choice, whilst co-op mode ensures your friend automatically follows you wherever you sign). Co-op in particular feels like the online extension of how I found myself playing splitscreen when it was added back to the series last year. Splitscreen has returned but it’s separate from the two-player career modes, which are online-based. Handling feels broadly similar to F1 2020 though the cars feel a little more responsive when moving laterally and are on more of a knife’s edge when it comes to grabbing too much curb at the wrong moment. Bottom out on a curb, or simply unsettle the aero balance enough, and the rear will whip around quick smart, so F1 2021 demands an exact touch. F1 2021 features no classic cars for the first time in many years so I won’t argue it’s the best-sounding F1 game to date without any V8s on deck. To be fair, however, there definitely has been some work on the sound this year, and the noticeably more prominent transmission whine adds a fine extra layer to the richness of the car audio. I do think it is the best-looking F1 game to date, however, and the enhancements here are across the board. The cars look excellent (particularly when carrying subtle racing damage), character models are much improved, and trackside detail is the most granular I’ve seen. Off-track surfaces like grass have received a big leap in fidelity. On the topic of tracks, F1 2021 is missing several tracks it needed to be able to accurately simulate the 2021 season from the get-go. That said, Imola, Portimao, and the new Jeddah street circuit are reportedly coming free at some point this year. That the real sport can pivot faster than the video game is an unfortunate reality of game development, but F1 2021 currently falls some distance short of being able to properly represent this year’s season. F1 2021 is the best-looking and most customisable instalment of the long-running Codemasters series to date, and the ability to tinker under the hood of the core career experience and play co-op with a friend is very welcome. With the addition of Braking Point it’s also arguably the boldest F1 game so far. The characterisation is a little underdone and the E for Everyone approach means it’s quite an airbrushed take on the F1 world compared to Netflix’s tense and profanity-laden Drive to Survive, but injecting a story mode into the F1 series was a risk well worth taking and I’m certainly looking forward to more of it. "
236,Scarlet Nexus ,8.0,"The genre of “Action-RPG” is a big umbrella that covers everything from soulslikes to first-person stealth-action games like Deus Ex to isometric RPGs like Diablo, and many more. But even within that wide spectrum, there’s nothing quite like Scarlet Nexus – a game that combines inspirations from fast-paced character-action games of the Devil May Cry and Bayonetta school with epic JRPGs the likes of the Persona and “Tales of” series. It’s a surprisingly ambitious undertaking, and perhaps even more surprising is that Scarlet Nexus hits far more often than it misses. So when I say that Scarlet Nexus is an action RPG, calling it that doesn’t really paint the full picture of what it’s about. Its moment-to-moment gameplay is a straight-up action game, through and through, like something you’d expect out of Platinum Games – its completely linear levels are structured so that you’re basically just moving from one closed-off battle to another while combat is fast, flashy, and reflex-driven.  But the key difference between this and Platinum’s style is that Scarlet Nexus is just as focused on its story, worldbuilding, and character development as it is on combat; perhaps even more so in some regards. First off, it’s split up into two separate 20-hour campaigns that each follow the story of one of the two main characters: Yuito and Kasane. While their journeys do overlap from time to time these are, for all intents and purposes, two distinct and equally essential campaigns that you can play in either order, and completing them both is required to get a full understanding of Scarlet Nexus’s story. And it’s a story worth experiencing – one which takes place in a fascinating world where the vast majority of the population are gifted with powers of the mind. City streets are colored with augmented-reality advertisements, people are able to send messages directly to each others’ brains, and those with exceptional combat abilities are drafted into a Special Forces-like organization called the OSF (Others Suppression Force) to do battle against otherworldly monstrosities known as “Others.”  Both Yuito and Kasane begin as newly minted members of the OSF and are placed onto two different platoons, each with their own squadmates and leaders; from that starting point, their journeys branch out in ways that have each character experiencing one side of a dense and complex plot full of conspiracies, ulterior motives, and surprising twists. Bandai Namco does an outstanding job of posing questions in one character’s playthrough and then answering them in the other by providing added context that better explains what led to certain events in ways that lead to some really satisfying pay-offs. While the overarching story is great, what really makes Scarlet Nexus special is the amount of care taken to develop its large supporting cast of eight characters who join Yuito and Kasane’s parties. After most big missions, you’re brought back to your hideout for a “stand-by phase” that gives you an opportunity to converse with your teammates, give them gifts (which they amusingly occasionally play with,) and trigger “bond episodes” that allow you to increase your bond level with each one. This is nothing super new to fans of the Mass Effect or Persona series, but what’s interesting about the way it’s handled here in Scarlet Nexus is that the bond episodes are very often tied to what’s happening in the main story, are entirely different depending on which campaign you’re playing, and are not always about improving a relationship. Sometimes the interactions in these bond episodes are outright hostile, but the important thing is that you always learn something about the character and why they act the way they do, or something that better explains the actions they just took in the main story.  Even though most of the characters in Scarlet Nexus do fall into very tropey anime archetypes (the childhood friend/romantic interest, the snooty elitist brat, the shy and soft-spoken girl, and so on) these bond episodes do a wonderful job of developing them, to a point where they wind up becoming more than just their tropes. By the end, even the ones that I rolled my eyes at initially – like the aforementioned snooty elitist prick, Shiden – became characters that I grew to really care about. While these scenes are rewards unto themselves, increasing your bond with a party member will also improve their special powers and open up more opportunities for them to help you in battle. That’s a nice extra incentive that also ties into the idea that your relationships with these characters are growing stronger. The story is also helped by wonderful performances in both English and Japanese, with the ability to choose whichever one strikes your fancy from the main menu. While it would’ve been nice to have more animated cutscenes as opposed to the static storyboard animatics, it’s an understandable compromise considering the sheer mountain of dialogue there is in Scarlet Nexus. Scarlet Nexus' biggest hurdle to overcome as a straight-up action game with a 40-hour, RPG-like story is making its combat engaging throughout that epic length. Remember, most character-action games only have to plan out around 10-12 hours’ worth of satisfying progression, so this is a rare thing to attempt. And while Scarlet Nexus does clear that hurdle, it definitely clips it on the way. At a basic level, combat is a lot of fun. Both Yuito and Kasane have the Jedi-like power of psychokinesis which allows them to telekinetically grab objects and hurl them towards enemies, but they use different weapons, and that’s enough to give them their own unique flavor in a fight. Yuito uses a sword with faster attacks and a supporting skill set that makes him better suited for close-range combat, while Kasane uses a handful of knives that she controls telekinetically. She’s a bit slower but well suited for mid-range combat, and her supporting skill set makes her a little trickier to handle than Yuito, but equally enjoyable. What really makes Scarlet Nexus’s combat stand out is how the telekinetic moves flow with the weapon-based attacks. At any point of a weapon combo, you can press the right trigger to immediately hop back and throw an object, then follow that with a weapon attack that brings you right back into melee range. The result of the ease of transition between the two is a really exciting and smooth mix of long-range and close-range combat. And then there are the crazy environmental interactables that you can use, like grabbing a train with your mind and causing it to crash through a crowd of enemies, taking them all out in a single go. On top of that, you’re able to borrow the abilities of your squadmates through the Struggle Arms System (SAS), which allows you to target key weaknesses of certain enemies or take advantage of specific status ailments, like when you use Hanabi’s pyrokinesis to ignite a group of enemies that have been doused with oil. When going up against tougher enemies, you really need to put it all together by mixing in regular attacks, psychokinetic attacks, and SAS abilities that target enemy weaknesses in order to succeed, which leads to some really satisfying fights that feel like you’re firing on all cylinders. The one place that Scarlet Nexus feels like it slips up on the fundamentals of combat is that targeting isn’t the greatest. I sometimes found myself swinging at air despite feeling like my attack should’ve connected, but not often enough to become more than a little frustrating. A bigger issue is that while the combat itself is highly dynamic, with lots of different abilities and powers that can each be upgraded in meaningful ways that change how they’re used over the course of the campaign, the enemies that you fight are not. There’s just not enough variety among them to healthily sustain a game of this length, especially since so many of them are of the “lock and key” variety: once you figure out the right ability to use against them, every fight thereafter always plays out the same. I do wish there were more of them, but I have to at least shout out the fact that the visual design of the enemies we do have to battle against is fantastic. The Others are a fantastical mix of beauty and monstrosity, combining the organic and inorganic in wildly inventive ways that are always unsettling to look at. The result of the lack of mechanical variety is that by the end of Yuito’s campaign, which is punctuated by multiple hours of very similar fights against very similar enemies, I was pretty exhausted from Scarlet Nexus’ combat and was not looking forward to immediately fighting through another one of a similar length (speaking strictly from a combat perspective). Fortunately, beating one campaign allows you to carry over your progress to the other, much like a New Game+. Not having to start from zero allowed me to blast through Kasane’s combat encounters much faster and get to the story, which was what I was really interested in at that point. In contrast to the inventive enemy designs, Scarlet Nexus’ levels are very often visually drab – we see areas like a mostly empty construction yard, an abandoned subway, and a broken-down highway with nothing done to really make them feel distinct. They make up for it with some terrifically fun environmental interactables, like the aforementioned train in the underground subway, the crane in the construction yard, or the bus that you can ride along a highway, crashing through groups of Others as you go. However, once again, variety remains an issue for a game of this length. That’s exacerbated by the fact that you’re regularly expected to travel through the same exact parts of the same exact levels, fighting the same or very similarly placed enemies. Yuito and Kasane at least get to visit a few unique locations that the other doesn’t ever get to see, so there is some added variety between the two campaigns, but I still found myself walking through the same AR bands of yellow tape, cruising past the same group of Others, or working my way to the same rooftop far too often. It’s understandable to take a look at Scarlet Nexus and write it off as “just another anime game,” but doing so would be a big mistake. This is an ambitious undertaking from Bandai Namco, one that attempts to blend the two disparate genres of character-action game and large-scale JRPG, and achieves an impressive level of success. Its combat and thin enemy variety don’t hold up all the way to the end of the combined 40 hours of its dual campaigns, but its story and characters absolutely do, and make for a surprise breakout hit of 2021. "
237,Mario Golf: Super Rush ,6.0,"There’s an art to how Nintendo usually iterates on its long-running series. That twist it almost always seems to discover makes us excited about what’s to come, while also looking back on fond memories already forged. Mario Golf: Super Rush, though, is an exception to that trend – it’s sporadically fun but it frustratingly falls short of the green more often than not. Its newly introduced Speed Golf mode is a bright point that shakes up the formula, while its lacklustre Adventure mode is a short and not overly sweet few hours. It makes for a package as a whole that offers some of the fun of the Mario Golf games of past generations, but when all is said and done it lacks the variety, replayability, and general amount of content needed to be considered a standout in the series. The original Mario Golf (titled NES Open Tournament Golf) is the first game I really remember playing, as I graduated from crawling around and tangling in my dad’s controller wires to holding the pad myself. The core mechanics remain, and apart from the obvious visual improvements, it doesn’t feel a million miles away from how it did 25-odd years ago: Line up your shot, press A to begin your swing, then A again (or B if you want to apply backspin) to lock in the power of your shot.  It’s these simple button presses as the power bar fills up on the right hand side of the screen, coupled with the subsequent sound of club hitting ball that evokes nostalgia and takes me to a happy place. The standard modes of match play and stroke play also provide comfort and familiarity, and as with every mode (aside from story campaign) these can be played solo or with up to three other players for a relaxed time with Mario and friends, but they’re so old and worn that while they’re certainly comforting, they’re nothing to get excited about. The mode that does spark some joy is Speed Golf. Speed Golf is the new twist on the formula this time around, and it’s fair to assume is what inspired the “Super Rush” part of Mario Golf: Super Rush’s name. This fresh take on a round of 18 holes is where I found the majority of my enjoyment coming from. Instead of simply taking your shot, watching to see where it goes, and then magically appearing next to your ball, it places as much importance on what happens in between strokes as the swings of the club itself. Of course, this is done in classic Nintendo fashion: there’s no jumping on your golf cart and slowly driving to your ball here (though now that I mention it I do like the idea of each hole being half Mario Kart track, half golf course). Instead, you’ll race competitors to your next lie, holding in B to dash for as long as your stamina bar will allow. You can also pick up hearts to refill that stamina, and coins which fill your special shot bar along the way. The placement of these items offers a fun tactical minigame to play within each shot, as you must weigh up which is the best “golf shot'' to play in order to reach the hole against which will lead you to pick up more coins without taking too much of a detour and wasting time. One option could lead to a more traditionally beneficial position, but the other could grant you that all-important special shot that bit quicker. As you might reasonably assume from the name, time is very much the key in Speed Golf, but the phrase “more haste, less speed” also rings very true. That’s because each shot you take adds 30 seconds to your time, so taking those extra few moments to line up a better shot will benefit you in the long run because the victor is determined by speed rather than who takes the fewest strokes. It’s a clever risk-vs-reward mechanic that keeps it fresh hole after hole. Sometimes plans can be disrupted, though, thanks to the unique character abilities belonging to each of the 16 playable characters. These aforementioned “special shots” are not only highly accurate shots, but come with effects that can be used to sabotage your opponents. They’re available to perform across all modes, but it’s in Speed Golf that they really come into their own. Luigi, for example, can turn the area around where his ball lands to ice, making for a difficult surface to putt and indeed run on if trying to get to your ball. King Bob-omb can spawn a series of (you guessed it)  bombs around his ball that can knock opponents and their balls away if touched. For my money, however, the most effective of these special abilities belongs to Wario: he can usher in a massive thunder cloud over an area of the hole, and anybody who tries to strike their ball at maximum power while under it will be struck by lightning, costing them a stroke. (I hate playing against him but make no apologies for doing so myself.) Although some of these special shots do double up over the full roster of 16 characters (like Mario and Bowser who can both blast away balls on impact), there’s enough variety to keep things interesting and find something that works for you. Each character also possesses their own special dash move when running between locations which grants a significant speed boost and knocks aside anyone in your path. These are less exciting to use, but do still give off the sort of serotonin-filled dose of schadenfreude that the blue and red shells of Mario Golf’s sister series, Mario Kart, supply all too well. All in all, I enjoyed playing Speed Golf and it definitely became my preferred mode to play, especially when compared to the relatively ponderous nature of the traditional modes.  One of the only real downsides to it is the fact that you can’t sit back and admire a beautiful shot you’ve made. I’ve only struck one hole-in-one so far in my time with Super Rush, and because it came during a Speed Golf round I never got to see what really happened. Sure, I was pleasantly surprised to see the words “Hole-in-One” flash up on the screen as I was running halfway down the fairway but the suspense of “will it or won’t it?” was lost. There’s no option to watch replays or highlights either across any of the modes, which just seems a little odd. I guess that mirrors real life as you walk up the hole to see the ball already sitting in it, but I’m not really playing a game with a giant ape one-handedly swinging a golf club towards a tornado for realism, to be honest. Further moving away from any form of reality (not a bad thing!) is the new Battle Golf, which didn’t ever grab me in the same way. Mainly that’s because it’s so fast-paced that it’s normally over before you have a moment to really get into it. It consists of you and three other competitors battling out in an arena to be the first to put their ball in three holes. Seems simple enough – but wait, there’s a catch. There are nine flags dotted around the stadium to go for, but they disappear once one of the four players has holed them. It makes for a fast and frantic game mode where the key to success, unfortunately, is to steer clear of trouble and go where others aren’t. Avoiding confrontation kind of defeats the whole idea of it being Battle Golf. The AI opponents are often not the sharpest tools either, and with no way of upping or lowering the difficulty I soon got bored of this mode. When the rounds rarely last upwards of three minutes, that means I became bored quite quickly indeed. Playing online against other humans does give more of a joyful spontaneity to Battle Golf, but it’s still all over far too quickly. It’s not a mode I can see myself playing much more of after my first few days, but it’s far from the dullest in Super Rush. Golf Adventure mode was what I was most looking forward to in Super Rush, with nostalgia of previous Mario Golf installments once again fuelling my expectations. Instead, I got a largely underwhelming four or five hours. Things start out promisingly, almost like a Pokemon game: you wake up in your home and are set off on your journey to become the very best by your proxy-mother, Birdo. Without spoiling what limited story there is here, you then go about earning badges to build your profile as a golfer before getting roped into saving the kingdom from an artificially engineered climate-change threat. It kinda comes out of nowhere and then finishes before you’ve been given a chance to ask as simple a question as “why?” Now don’t get me wrong, I wasn’t going into this expecting storytelling on the level of Homer’s Odyssey, but something akin to Mario’s own Odyssey from a few years back wouldn’t have gone amiss, either. It’s not really even a Mario story at all – aside from a few extended cameos from some familiar faces it’s all a bit rushed, and I’m sure not in the way that “Super Rush” is intended. It starts slow, as you learn the ropes on beginner courses before developing into a series of repetitive and clunky boss battle encounters which have you dodging attacks and firing golf balls at enemies in moderate anger. That’s not to say that Golf Adventure doesn’t have its high points. I particularly enjoyed a challenge that involved completing nine holes of the whirlwind and water-littered Ridgerock Lake course in under 40 strokes. The twist being that you could do them in any order and continued playing on from the green of each hole, only teeing off once. This turned this into a more puzzle-like section that had me genuinely thinking about what the best strategy to take would be. It’s a shame that this challenge type is only used once, however, because it felt like there was more for it to do. In fact, lots of mechanics are brought in and used very briefly, and sometimes introduced then not used at all. For example, about halfway through the journey you’re given a club that has the ability to make your shots skim across the water, which sounds and looks very cool. So when I was given no real opportunity to ever use this past the tutorial section in which you learn how to use it, I was baffled. More confusingly, none of the other characters have the ability to use this technique in any of the other modes, meaning it’s rendered almost completely redundant. And this wasn’t the only time something like this happened. I would say that Golf Adventure isn’t worth sinking the time into, but the truth is that it’s kind of necessary if you want to be able to enjoy the rest of what Super Rush has to offer. Not only does it teach you basic golfing skills and introduce you to the rules of Speed Golf, but it’s the only way to unlock all of the courses for use in the other modes. It’s also the only place to level up your Mii character, which comes with both pros and cons: don’t play the Adventure mode and you’ll have a character who can’t compete in other modes, but play it fully and you’ll likely have an overpowered character who can out-drive every other member of the roster. There’s a lack of balance to be found here, especially if you want to play as your Mii characters against a friend in local multiplayer, as it will mean they’ll also have to complete the story mode in order to have a chance against you. There are six courses in total, which isn’t a huge amount (especially when compared to World Tour, which had 10 before DLC), but at least they offer variety. The super sandy Balmy Dunes will test your approach play, while Wildweather Woods has (you guessed it, again) wild weather to contend with. They’re each visually appealing in their own ways, and while Super Rush doesn’t look like a top-tier Nintendo game graphically, it bursts with colour – especially when playing in handheld mode. I can’t help but wish there were just a couple more courses, though, even if the handful provided at launch are fun enough. The truth is that unless you’re interested in regularly playing online then there’s not a whole lot more to do after the first few hours except chase your own high scores once the story has finished. Confusingly, there are also no online tournaments to play – another thing World Tour has that has been omitted here, making it feel light on things to do by comparison to its older sibling. All the courses will be unlocked after the story is complete and all the characters are there from the start. There are special club sets to earn for each of the 16 characters that you must buy with loyalty coins earned by playing as them, but this really does pale in comparison to recent parallels such as Everybody’s Golf which is much better at constantly giving you items to earn and a sense of genuine progression. The truth is that after several hours of playing I’d had a fun enough time with Super Rush, but I was left just thinking, “Well, what’s next?” a whole lot sooner than I ever thought I would be. Mario Golf: Super Rush is a comfort-food game that, to some (like me!), can take you to a happy place with a couple taps of the same button followed by an exclamation of “Nice Shot!” Its standout Speed Golf mode is a great twist on Mario Golf and a genuinely fun way to play that goes a fair way to spicing up an age-old formula by filling the space between swings with a madcap foot race to the next one. Though even if that mode is a tidy birdie, sadly there are just too many bogeys elsewhere in Super Rush in the form of a poor adventure mode, a slight selection of courses, low replayability, and just a general lack of things to do after you’ve burnt through its content once that make for an unsuccessful round. Arcade golf games like this are made to be played with friends for a long time, but there just doesn’t feel like enough variety on offer here to make me want to. Without that longevity I just can’t place Super Rush in the category of a top-tier Mario Golf game. "
238,Chivalry 2 ,9.0,"While other first-person sword fighting games like Mordhau and Kingdom Come: Deliverance have tried to sell themselves on the realism of their hitboxes or the high skill ceilings of their combat systems, Chivalry: Medieval Warfare has always been unashamed to fall a bit more on the arcadey side. Its sequel, Chivalry 2 continues that tradition, and I think it's actually a better multiplayer experience because of that philosophy. There’s still a lot of skill involved, but it's easier to dive in and start getting some gloriously gory kills without feeling like you're a sheep surrounded by wolves. And that's how you build and keep a strong community. Chivalry 2 catapults you onto stylish, saturated battlefields with up to 64 players in objective-based team modes or a giant free-for-all. There aren't a ton of maps right now, but I was pretty impressed with the ones we have. Each has a good variety of objectives to attack and defend, exciting terrain and architecture, an effective mix of open areas and bottlenecks, and great overall pacing. One moment you might be pushing titanic siege towers up to a wall with ballista bolts flying at you from above, and the next you might be trying to loot as much gold as possible from a village and get it back to your cart before time runs out.  Sure, there are definitely a few objectives that feel unbalanced at the moment. The bridge on Falmire, for instance, I've only seen successfully taken by the attackers once in the dozens of times I've played it. The ramp on Lionspire is pretty sticky, too. But it's nothing that a few minor tweaks shouldn’t be able to fix. And it might even out a bit once everyone gets a bit more experience and understands how these objectives work. Rather than having you build out a complex custom kit with all the exact weapons and armor you want, Chivalry has 12 set classes divided into four archetypes, with four available at the start and the rest unlocked as you go. You can also unlock new primary and secondary weapons within each class, so there's a lot of meaningful progression to work toward. I was a little disappointed I couldn't just go crazy mixing and matching, but I soon found that there are kits to support just about every playstyle I could imagine, from a deadly crossbow sniper to a frenzied, axe-hurling berserker. Some have stronger niches than others. There's a rogue class which gets a bonus to backstab damage, but I never really found that I could make the most of this in team fights or one-on-one. The skirmisher, who throws javelins, is supposed to be kind of a hybrid between a melee and a ranged class, but ends up just feeling worse at both than her specialist counterparts. And shields, I found more often a burden than a boon. But the offensive monsters like the devastator and the crusader are a ton of fun. And while you'll see plenty of people in chat moaning about archers being too powerful, it does require a lot of practice and good instincts to make the most of them. I also admired that, within each class, special abilities tend to focus on supporting your team rather than simply making you better as a single combatant. Even if you're not the best one-on-one fighter in the world, you can still make a world of difference in big encounters by blowing your war horn and giving a hefty area-of-effect heal to your side of the melee. And in another clever bit of design, you recharge these powers faster by doing things your class is good at and should be doing anyway, like getting kills with your charge attack as the furious raider or blocking attacks as the stalwart guardian. The combat system is, of course, the core of everything. And with more than 30 hours under my belt, I'm loving it. It's not the most realistic medieval brawler I've ever played, but this is power fantasy, not a documentary. The overall flow of it and the ways in which it limits how much an extremely skilled player can absolutely dominate the battlefield hit a sweet spot for me. Though don't think you can easily climb to the top of the leaderboards by wildly swinging a mace around. Lopping off appendages in gory displays of warrior aggression makes Chivalry: Medieval Warfare's up-close and personal melee combat a gritty and fulfilling on a primal level. Though the lack of complexity sometimes works both for and against it, getting caught up in the flow of battle yields many hours of man-stabbing amusement. Like its competition, Chivalry hasn't quite perfected the formula for medieval warfare, but it's a violent, fun time nonetheless. There are just enough ways to attack, parry, riposte, dodge, and counter that it pays to be able to think on your feet and react to what your opponent is doing. But executing those moves once you've committed to a decision doesn't require godlike reflexes or extremely precise mouse movements. There's a high skill ceiling, but the difference between a pretty good player and a really good player is smaller than in a game like Mordhau, which I think is a smart decision. Bad and okay players are always going to outnumber the truly exceptional ones, and they need to still be able to have fun or they'll abandon you. Even if you're the best blademaster in the realm, you need teammates to stand on the objective. It also doesn't feel too arcadey, which is an issue I had with the first Chivalry. Aside from the very first couple of days, the servers seem to be holding up pretty well, too. Getting into a match is lightning quick, thanks in no small part to the willingness to include a few bots to get those huge, 64-player matches off the ground. I've rarely experienced any major connection issues while playing for at least a few hours a day. The skill-based aspect of matchmaking could still use some work. It will auto-balance teams if one side seems to be completely dominating, but there doesn't seem to be anything to keep the swapped players from going back to their original team if a spot opens up. And I see that happen a lot. So if people are just being jerks and insisting on wearing their favorite color, you can end up in some extremely lopsided battles. The one other thing I've found a bit lacking is the visual customization of your character. It’s nice that you can play as a woman for the first time, but if you do, each class only has one voice to choose from and far fewer face options than the guys get. Also some of the ladies look pretty weird, almost like they took an existing male face model and stretched it out like the title screen for Super Mario 64. There are some bizarre male faces, too, but the difference in quality is pretty easy to see. At least there's a good variety of armor styles, heraldry, and weapon skins you can unlock with premium currency or in-game cash you get from levelling up. Some of the skins require you to reach a certain level with the weapon before you can even buy them, so you can show off your skill with a shiny, gilded sword. And rest assured, as far as I could find there's nothing that's exclusively locked behind spending real money. I am having a ton of fun with Chivalry 2. The maps, outside of a few balance issues, are a total blast – everything from the shining armor to the soaring castle walls looks great and there are  a huge range of objectives to keep things interesting. Whether I'm swinging a sword or plucking away with a bow, combat hits that elusive sweet spot between accessible dumb fun and rewarding, skill-based mechanics where the wheat is separated from the chaff. When you respawn and everyone around you is spamming the battle cry button as you rush headlong into certain death, you just know you're in for a rockin' time. I don't think I'll be putting away this sweaty coat of mail for a good while. "
239,The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood ,7.0,"Returning to the marshes and swamps surrounding the idyllic city of Leyawiin feels like a portal to a completely different time period of The Elder Scrolls lore. The last time we saw this part of Tamriel was back in 2006, where it occupied the southeastern corner of Cyrodiil in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. For reference, that was several years before we even knew there was going to be a Fallout 3, so it’s safe to say that it’s been a little while. The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood knows exactly which heartstrings it’s pulling here, as its roughly 20 hours of content – minus the endgame raid stuff – is littered with gags and unmissable references to Oblivion that generally end up feeling more endearing rather than stale. The setting may be unique, but Blackwood is still very much the same ESO that fans have grown used to. This expansion barely breaks away – at all, in fact – from the formulaic zone design that it’s established over the last several years since its Morrowind chapter in 2017. We get the same exact number of quests, locations, skyshards, world bosses, and a new trial – which is the bog-standard configuration of new things that we get in every single new expansion each year. The developer, Zenimax Online, is nothing if not consistent! But at least it’s safe to say that the writing is filled with more zingers relative to last year’s comparatively dry Greymoor expansion, the geography of Blackwood itself is more varied and interesting, and the addition of companions that level up alongside you and follow you on your journey make its inherent repetition ever so slightly more interesting.  To be precise: there are seven main quests, six delves, nine points of interest with quests attached to them, two public dungeons, six world bosses, 18 skyshards to find, and a brand-new trial called Rockgrove – basically ESO’s equivalent of a raid. That said, good luck getting through it without a full group of 12 players. If you’re not in a guild, it’s still tough to find anyone to group up and play through that one with – even a week after launch on PC – and you’ll definitely need backup. The world boss encounters are way more sophisticated and unique this time around. For example, the Sul-Xan Ritual Site faces you up against a group of Argonian priests who each share the same broader health bar. Meanwhile, The Shattered Xanmeer features one of the most fun and intense open world boss battles I’ve come across in ESO – where Oblivion portals open and close around you at all sides while a flurry of Daedra swarm over the battlefield. It’s great fun if your PC can keep up with the action. If you love gorgeous, nostalgic landscapes above all else, The Elder Scrolls Online's new Greymoor expansion offers a strongly nostalgic return to the northwestern corner of Skyrim. The formulaic story isn't as compelling, but it's at least buoyed by a couple of standout characters. The rest of Greymoor is largely a variation on the familiar ESO formula, although a new ""Antiquities"" system introduces a welcome new way to earn cash, gear, and cosmetic items. Summerset launched in 2018, boasting the garnished Chapel of Zenithar in the city centre and Castle Leyawiin to the east. The fiery red Deadlands contrast against the verdant green swamplands which surround the northwestern portion of the map, and both of those contrast against the sunken, blood-soaked marshes and half-built towers that cover its eastern half. There’s a lot to see here, and the deliberate detail that went into hand-crafting each part of the new zone is noticeable. Sunken ruins of various castles and Ayleid structures line the horizon in every direction. And there are plenty of Easter eggs too, such as the Adoring Admirer and the dancing dog at the White Stallion Inn. Gideon is also a treat to visit. Despite the fact that it’s an old fortress town built atop a festering bog, it’s super cozy and filled with life. Different sections of the town feature bards and live entertainment, and the city itself is a melting pot; Khajiit, Argonians, and Imperials dot the streets and share their respective cultures, making Gideon feel even more unique and culturally important than Leyawiin to the west. The Elder Scrolls Online: Blackwood delivers more of the same – albeit this new helping is a step up from last year’s Greymoor expansion in its often funny writing and striking map layout. Blackwood leans hard on its nostalgia, but it actually manages to feel like an appropriate prequel to Oblivion without forcing you down too many of the same paths. Its companion system is definitely worth checking out, too, but it may not be enough gameplay variety to recommit a fan who is tired of ESO in general. For those of us who are still happily jogging along on the treadmill, though, there’s plenty to do and see here, if for no other reason than to simply fortify your understanding of Elder Scrolls lore. "
240,Operation: Tango ,7.0,"Communication is key, and that’s true whether you’re in a relationship or guiding someone through defusing a bomb that’s about to send the world back to the Stone Age. Operation: Tango is an asymmetrical, co-op-only spy ’em up inspired by the likes of 2015 indie puzzler Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes and all those scenes in the Mission: Impossible movies where Simon Pegg is telling Tom Cruise which direction to run in. With one player assuming the role of the field agent and the other the intrepid hacker running support remotely, success demands total cooperation exclusively via voice communications to negotiate its short series of high-tech infiltrations. The end result is ultimately a bit lighter on outright action than I’d anticipated – and some of the puzzles are annoyingly silly – but when Operation: Tango clicks, it’s cool and satisfying albeit short and a little shallow.  With a cyberterrorist to catch and the core philosophy of Rob Base and D.J. E-Z Rock as your guiding star, it’s up to you and ideally your least stupid friend to negotiate your way through what’s essentially a tangled thread of puzzles where each of you will generally only ever have half the answers. Broadly speaking, the agent’s missions play out in first-person on-site and the hacker’s missions occur in a stylised virtual environment of databases and Hollywood-style software systems, but there are regular instances where the hacker will suddenly find themselves immersed in a bizarre virtual world or the agent will be required to dig through computer files and do their own hacking. (There’s probably a bit too much of the latter, but I’ll get to that in a moment.) The main thing to know is that Operation: Tango is overtly designed so the only way you should know what your friend is seeing is if they explain it to you, and therefore it’s very much a remote co-op experience and not a same-screen, same-couch one. Operation: Tango is at its absolute best when it really leans into core spy movie tropes like, say, when the agent needs to sneak into an empty office to boot up a particular employee’s computer to give the hacker the info they need to progress, or when the hacker is guiding the agent around deadly drones or lasers with urgent, barked instructions. A mission set on a moving train is a particular highlight, beginning with an immersive game of hide-and-seek as the agent and hacker work together to uncover an unknown mule and ending with a race against time to stop the runaway loco with the most dangerously convoluted emergency braking system ever devised. The puzzles can be a fraction hit-and-miss, however, and for every frantic emergency procedure or neat bit of codebreaking there’s an obtuse rhythm-matching button-bashing sequence where we literally had to pause while I retrieved a pen and paper, or an irritating moving ball puzzle where one player controls the X-axis and the other controls the Y-axis. Operation: Tango is arguably at its weakest when the required tasks get too trite and illogical within the espionage fantasy developer Clever Plays has worked hard to establish. Unfortunately, it has a bit of a habit of going from shrewdly designed brainteasers that give you and your mate just enough breadcrumbs to bust wide open and enjoy the teamwork-driven lightbulb moments they create, to stretches of time where I felt like I was mindlessly mashing buttons. While Operation: Tango works to separate its roles, with the agent in the thick of the action and the hacker peering into the digital abyss, there’s arguably a bit too much supplemental hacking regularly required of the agent character. As the agent doesn’t really have any combat capabilities it often feels like there are simply two hackers, only one has to walk around while the other sits. Operation: Tango would’ve benefited from more objectives where the agent was on the run through the levels with only the hacker’s guidance. This is definitely where I had the most fun playing the agent. It would also have been more fun were the frame rate as the agent on PS5 not so surprisingly uneven, especially given the simple and chunky visual style doesn’t seem like it should be especially taxing on such modern hardware. It wasn’t bad enough to turn me off playing but it certainly was noticeable. Our playthrough of the six total missions in Operation: Tango took a little under four hours. Hypothetically it’s good for at least a pair of runs as switching roles will allow you to see each mission through a different lens. That said, even though you’ll be doing different tasks, knowing what the other player is seeing because you’ve done it before spoils Operation: Tango’s special sauce. Even though the actual codes and answers to the puzzles change when replaying missions, the way you uncover the info is the same, so you’ll really just be going through the motions. However, while it’s admittedly a fairly brief experience it’s worth noting that Operation: Tango will actually let a friend join the action with you for no additional charge; only one player needs to own it and the other can play along with them simply by downloading the free trial. (And of course it’s included in PlayStation Plus at the moment.) Operation: Tango is a clever and appealing take on a co-op spy experience with eye-catching style and excellent music. It’s short and not all that replayable, and some of the puzzles are annoyingly silly when compared to its best challenges and conundrums, but it’s still well worth a play with a friend with patience and a keen eye for detail. "
241,atchet and Clank: Rift Apart ,9.0,"Ratchet and Clank have been doing the whole “saving the universe” thing for quite some time, and their latest adventure, Rift Apart, amusingly acknowledges that right from the start. But the duo’s age doesn’t show at all thanks to an amazing outing – their first new one in nearly a decade – that is a gorgeous and expertly crafted example of what PS5 exclusives can look and play like. And even compared to great work building out a universe for Spider-Man, Rift Apart may be Insomniac’s most emotionally resonant game yet. With more touching and clever writing that makes good on the promise of a multi-dimensional trip unlike anything the series has done before, Rift Apart makes old characters fresh and new additions so indelible it’s hard to imagine the series without them. ...Even if ""Ratchet and Clank and Rivet"" would be a pretty long name. Whether you’re new to swinging Ratchet’s wrench or a veteran of the DreadZone, Rift Apart’s mix of third-person shooting and platforming is immediately easy to understand. Ratchet has always been a series about exploration and combat, and thanks to the dip-free stability of the 30fps Fidelity mode, the latter in particular has never felt so good. And while I've only gotten to spend a bit of time with them so far, the Performance and Performance Ray Tracing modes are even smoother at a steady 60fps (watch our Rift Apart Performance Review below for direction comparisons that highlight the differences). I'm completely okay with sacrificing some of the visual effects on my Challenge mode run thanks to how well the higher framerate keeps up with Rift Apart's controlled chaos. That sensation of never slowing down is also thanks to the spectacular load times, which are, as promised, practically nonexistent. Whether you’re jumping through rifts to a new location on the same planet or an entirely different one, or switching characters, I never noticed so much as a hitch, pause, or stutter. Some loads are cleverly hidden behind smart cuts and cutscenes, but for all intents and purposes, Insomniac has delivered a seamless adventure from start to finish.  That’s achieved despite the fact that this is the prettiest PS5 game yet, and one of the best-looking games I’ve ever played. Insomniac has used its cartoony color palette to create a dazzling array of interstellar locations, like the densely packed metropolis of Nefarious City or the lush greenery of Sargasso that benefit from impressive use of ray tracing reflections. Back in the day we used to see “Ratchet and Clank looks almost like a Pixar movie” comparisons; with Rift Apart, it has kept pace with much of the work in recent hits like Incredibles 2 and Soul (though Pixar’s pre-rendered animation definitely has an edge in certain scenes). It’s not just the varied vistas that frequently stopped me in my tracks, it’s the little details – like the gears moving on the familiar Buzz Blade weapon – and the sheer variety of them. I didn’t know I needed to see Ratchet’s fur in such glorious fidelity, but the more advanced animations and 4K textures allow the entire cast to be more expressive than ever. Rift Apart also gives Pixar a run for its money in its ability to tell an emotional story while also maintaining its excellent comedy. While it’s the funniest game I’ve played in some time, the writing strikes just the right balance between that comedy and the heartfelt, the silly and the sincere. Additionally, it’s not obsessed with referencing past games to the point of alienating newcomers. I can only speculate here due to my own familiarity with the series, but I’d bet that Rift Apart’s best moments will land regardless of your experience with the pair’s previous adventures, especially thanks to the multiverse concept that allows the developers to introduce new takes on familiar characters. It’s through the exploration of the multiverse that we see the debut of Rivet, a playable parallel of Ratchet who proves to be one of Insomniac’s best-written characters ever and yet another memorable performance from voice acting veteran Jennifer Hale (known for female Commander Shepard, among many others). A resistance fighter against Emperor Nefarious in her previously unseen own universe, Rivet is a strong-willed do-gooder, and you can certainly see the shades of Ratchet in her characterization. But Rivet isn’t just a gender-swap; she’s a distinctive personality all her own, with unique wants and hopes, including trust issues that come from years of fighting without a parallel Clank by her side. Where her story goes and how it’s intertwined with Ratchet and Clank’s quickly makes her a vital part of this series’ DNA. While it’s a little disappointing that Rivet doesn’t get her own set of moves, it at least means you don’t have to worry about upgrading and equipping the two protagonists independently when you land on a new planet and are automatically switched from one to the other. That’s not to say the headlining duo gets the short end of the intergalactic stick. Ratchet’s internal struggle over whether he actually wants to find the rest of his catlike lombax race looms large, while Clank’s own sense of self-worth in the face of injury is moving. Rift Apart has a surprisingly deft approach to dealing with mental health topics among its entire cast in ways that feel honest and deep, and it’s all wrapped up in this exciting, bright, and bubbly adventure. We’ve gotten hints and teases about the existence of other dimensions before – with the Dimensionator specifically serving as a cliffhanger from 2013’s Ratchet and Clank: Into the Nexus – but Rift Apart makes good on the multiverse idea in hilarious, charming, and even surprisingly touching ways. Sometimes it’s played for laughs, like with alternate-reality takes on existing characters, and other times it’s used in mechanically clever ways, such as when Ratchet or Rivet hop between two versions of the same planet to find pathways that are closed in one dimension are open in another, but also with more danger lying in wait. Rift Apart includes the series’ first-ever photo mode, and after Insomniac’s great work with this option in the Spider-Man games it’s an excellent addition, especially given how beautiful these worlds are. I actually didn’t spend a ton of time with it during my initial playthrough, but that was largely because I knew if I did I may never get around to actually playing. Rift Apart offers beautiful photo op after beautiful photo op, and the customization options – including changing out armor pieces, adding in light sources, and other standard features – makes it one of the most robust photo modes out there. The story is told via Rift Apart’s world-by-world approach – that’s a standard formula for the Ratchet and Clank series, but in this case a lot of work was done to make every planet unique, and each with its own stories and structure that’s distinct from one another. Each world’s story, incidental dialogue, and encounters feel tuned to the personality of whichever lombax you’re controlling there: the furball Sargasso denizens you’ll meet as Rivet are all named Mort and bring with them a kindly American midwest tone and accent to their conversations, while Zurkie's serves as an interstellar crossroads bar and battle arena for travelers like Rivet. Later planets play more with the multiverse idea in some surprising and genre-hopping ways, including one that draws heavily on some of the games Insomniac has made since the last time we saw Ratchet and is executed better than when Naughty Dog tried a similar thing with Uncharted. Each world also has a side quest outside of the main adventure, which allows for a bit more local color to be added and usually some more intriguing platforming sections to pull off. The art direction at large allows the impressive level of detail to remain surprising throughout, thanks to the variety of worlds you’ll explore. Yes, some interiors will share similar metallic, futuristic vibes, and gameplay-relevant surfaces like spots for your gravity boots to stick to will repeat so that they’re instantly recognizable no matter where you go. But every world has its own visual identity that’s a treat to discover, offering different tones, geography, and ensembles of memorable characters. Moment-to-moment gameplay also has new nuances for returning fans to explore. Ratchet and Rivet’s movement has been fine tuned since the 2016 reboot on PS4, and simple additions like a beautifully animated dash move and wallrunning make a world of difference. It not only allows for trickier and more intricate platforming sections and more varied collectible placement, but it brings new nuance to combat as well. The dodge ability allows the lombaxes to phase through incoming attacks, and timing a dash just right to get in close and deal big damage is a consistent new thrill. Ratchet can do melee damage with his wrench (and Rivet with her hammer), but in Rift Apart I’ve used his standard weapon a lot less frequently than I did in previous games thanks to the increased scale of battles. In Rift Apart, you need to be more clever with your use of the array of wacky weaponry, and the rifts scattered throughout come in handy for both battles and scouring the environment for collectibles. They’re conveniently placed in most combat arenas to let Ratchet get to higher ground or cross the battlefield, and they saved me more times than I’d care to admit. It’s certainly reminiscent of jumping through a portal in, well, Portal, but the on-screen effect of the new location hurtling toward you coupled with the DualSense’s haptics gives the mechanic its own distinct flair, while adding much more tactical variety to combat than the series has ever seen. It’s never not cool to leap across the battlefield and leave enemies confused in your wake or surprised by your sudden appearance as you gain a momentary upper hand. The best uses of them certainly come during big action moments when rifts hurtle you far greater distances – namely, from planet to planet while mid-chase or boss fight. It’s especially amusing to come across a later world and realize you saw it for a brief moment while dodging a massive robot’s fists. And Rift Apart’s great arsenal of weapons let you make the most of those opportunities. Even though I miss some of my old series favorites like the Sheepinator and Groovitron, I have to give Rift Apart credit for some instant classics: the Topiary Sprinkler, for instance, transforms enemies into whackable weeds, and the Ricochet shoots a pinball-like pellet at enemies that, properly timed, can deal more damage on subsequent hits. That just scratches the surface of the more than a dozen options, and yet none of them feels redundant or superfluous. Because you’re facing more enemies at a time than in the previous games, and often different combinations of them, I also found myself switching between weapons more than ever before. Yes, I’d gravitate toward my favorites, like the powerful shotgun-like Enforcer, but if you’re not taking advantage of crowd-control options like Mr. Fungi to fend off waves of smaller enemies like the returning Robomutts, or defensive weapons like the intriguing Void Repulsor to block fire from the reptilian Goons-4-Less and their constant barrage of blaster rounds, it’s easy to be overwhelmed. That’s especially true when Emperor Nefarious’ massive robotic minions, who shoot various lasers and rapid-fire energy bursts or wield giant mace-like arms, enter the fray. After the great strides Insomniac made with accessibility options in its Spider-Man games, it’s nice to see an even more varied group of options present in Rift Apart. I am by no means an expert or in the best position to fully know how useful each of these features actually is for those who need them, but the number of visual and audio adjustments you can make, all without affecting completion rates or trophies, is an important inclusion in such a large game. One that feels particularly useful is the ability to allow you to slow the speed of the entire game to make time-sensitive inputs like platforming and combat less frenetic and demanding. There are multiple speed levels to choose from, and it can be turned on and off at will if you only need it for a specific section or fight. For a deeper conversation about what Rift Apart offers, be sure to watch our spoiler-free Podcast Beyond discussion. These weapons are, of course, where you’ll also get the most use out of the DualSense’s haptics. Each weapon’s firepower, from the wild booms of the Enforcer to the short blips of the Burst Pistol, is mirrored in the controller’s advanced rumble. One of the most fun and frequent effects, though, is passing through a rift. As I threw out the rift tether to pull myself through space, the sensation of the rift coming closer to and then surrounding me was always neat in the midst of a battle’s chaos. (The use of the adaptive triggers is a little disappointing – in the PS5’s first six months, alt-fire for weapons being the difference between a half and full pull has been just about the only real use for them in a combat-heavy experience like this.) Naturally, Rift Apart isn’t all combat, as any action-platformer worth its bolts/coins/studs/rings/etc. will find ways to vary up gameplay. However, some of these segments were the only parts of the campaign where I felt the momentum was lost. For instance, there are occasional bits where Ratchet or Rivet have to hitch a ride on a speedy space slug to avoid poisonous waters; it’s amusing the first time or two, but never really becomes anything more than getting from point A to point B. And aerial combat on the back of an intergalactic pterodactyl sounds awesome but it occurs only once and is fairly rudimentary. Neither idea is bad, per se, and they’re only meant to be momentary diversions, but they stand out from the rest of the campaign because they don’t quite match the ingenuity of nearly every other style of gameplay.  To be fair, there are many other twists that fare much better. Clank has several physics-puzzle sections that require you to use the right combination of power orbs to move a series of ethereal Clanks along a pathway and fix interdimensional anomalies. None are particularly difficult to solve, but they quickly and consistently make me feel clever as I find the right path along which to speed up, weigh down, or lift up all these Clank copies as he waxes philosophic with another character about the journey, and his emotional state, so far. There’s also a series of optional pocket dimensions hidden throughout Rift Apart’s worlds which offer clever platforming challenges that will test your timing like little else, and a new battle arena where you can earn some extra upgrades in between story missions. Most of these battles have some amusing twists, too, like limiting you to a specific weapon or introducing a massive column of spinning blades that’s constantly chasing you as you take on other foes. But one of my favorite additions is the introduction of Glitch, a spider-like robot whom Ratchet calls on to battle computer viruses, depicted as literal viral blobs and monsters infecting a number of technological pathways. These behind-the-back, third-person shooting sequences are relatively simple and become a bit rote by the end, since you’re limited to either a quick burst fire or a series of more powerful rockets, but I looked forward to every Glitch sequence because of just how damn endearing their personality is. Glitch is neurotically self-aware, anxious, and wary of taking on bad guys, but their journey of self-discovery and finding the confidence to be a valuable team member, nudged along by Ratchet’s encouragement, is positively charming. Rift Apart also includes a set of collectible armor sets that come in three parts, which can be mixed and matched on either Ratchet or Rivet. But more importantly, regardless of whether you ever wear one (which I didn’t for my initial playthrough because I love the base character designs so much), collecting these sets will earn you some welcome stat buffs, like more damage against specific sets of enemies. Gold Bolts are also littered throughout the lands, and each one offers its own set of bonuses, including new photo mode options, weapon cosmetic options, and more. Attaching those rewards to them makes collecting the bolts much more engaging to collect along the journey, rather than just for post-game cleanup. I eventually finished Rift Apart’s campaign after about 16 hours, having completed 90 percent of everything, including those collectibles. Cleaning up the remainder should only take a couple more hours, but beating the story also unlocks the franchise-stalwart Challenge mode that amps up the difficulty substantially. That’s a good thing, because Rift Apart’s standard difficulty is a relatively breezy one – I may have died two or three times in battle. That said, I had enough close calls early on to really drive home the benefits of staying mobile, varying up my weapon use, and keeping an eye on ammo. Ratchet and Clank is a culmination of everything Insomniac has done with the series over the past 14 years. It takes the characters that we fell in love with long ago, and sets them off on their most gorgeous quest yet. The deep and rewarding weapon system, beautiful and varied worlds, and charming-as-heck story make it an adventure that anyone with a PlayStation 4 should strap in for. Read the full Ratchet and Clank 2016 ReviewThor: Ragnarok work, mixing familiar franchise themes with new orchestral takes and a series of synth-laden pieces that would have pleased Jeff Goldblum’s Grandmaster. It matches the bombastic action when needed to, but some of my favorite tracks come amidst quieter character or exploration moments. I need it on vinyl, stat. The score never drowns out the bashing, shooting, and quipping that are core to Ratchet’s gameplay, though. And while it all sounds fantastic on a home speaker system, this is yet another PS5 exclusive for which you’ll want 3D-enabled headphones to get the full effect. Walking through Nefarious City, the chatter of passing bots and vehicles can be heard as they go whooshing by, while mid-combat you get a better sense of where every foe and friendly assistant is when you can’t see them. The only truly disappointing aspect is that the 3D audio doesn’t factor into gameplay more often, as the engaging setup led me to expect. There’s a brief mission in Nefarious City that requires you to listen for the thumping beats of Club Nefarious to find your way through the city, and it worked so much better with headphones on. That cool example of integrating audio into gameplay made me want more. Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart is a stunner. It not only gives the latest generation of consoles a game that looks as beautiful as the improved tech promised, but it’s also a fantastic experience to play. Insomniac has been around the Ratchet and Clank block plenty of times before, but Rivet and other new characters add so much charm, wit, and heart to a franchise I’ve loved for most of my life. That’s coupled with series-best action-platforming gameplay and incredible art and sound design across the board. Rift Apart may not be the biggest adventure around, but its big heart, wild weapons, and incredible detail easily make it one of the most memorable of the year so far. "
242,Guilty Gear Strive ,9.0,"Guilty Gear is arguably one of the most underappreciated fighting game series out there. I know this because I’ve been guilty of underappreciating it myself.  For one reason or another – maybe I just didn’t think I was skilled enough to get good at them, or I just wasn’t in the right headspace – I never really tried to learn one in depth. But when Guilty Gear Strive was announced, I made the determination that I would no longer let this be a blind spot in my fighting game knowledge, and rather than just dipping my toes in the water like I have for every other Guilty Gear game, with Strive I made the full, headfirst plunge. Well, after making the dive I’m happy to report that I love Guilty Gear Strive. It’s not without its share of faults and stumbles, but they pale in comparison to the gorgeous art, the electric soundtrack, the wildly inventive character designs, the stable netcode, and its balance of approachability and depth, each of which raise the bar for other 2D fighters to follow. Over seven games and multiple spinoffs spanning the last two decades, Guilty Gear has quietly amassed some of the densest lore throughout all of fighting games. If any kind of proof of this is needed, just take a look the seemingly never-ending in-game glossary of terms and figures, the timeline of events covering 1998 to 2187 (did you know that in 2009, India withdrew from the UN due to dissatisfaction with the UN’s decision to ban all electronic devices?), and the correlation chart that covers every event and relationship formed from every game in the series.  All this is to say that Guilty Gear Strive very much feels like a climax of everything that the series’ story has been building towards for all of these years, and it’s a story that’s aimed squarely at those who are caught up on the long journeys of its core cast of characters. So if you don’t know who “That Man” is, or his significance to Sol Badguy, chances are you’re probably going to want to watch a recap video or two... or five. And you really should put in that extra effort if you’re not caught up, because once you understand who these characters are and the struggles that they’ve gone through to get where they’re at in Strive, it’s story is actually pretty dang good – and it’s told in a way that’s unique in the world of fighting games. Like the Xrd games, Strive’s story mode is entirely devoid of gameplay, and should be enjoyed much like a binge-watchable anime series. It’s a bold decision to make a story mode in a video game that you don’t play at all, but it’s one that I actually have a great deal of respect for. By focusing on just the story, Strive is able to avoid shoehorning in battles in places where they wouldn’t naturally fit, and the result is a story mode that feels completely uncompromised by gameplay. When you actually do get to play, it becomes obvious why Guilty Gear has always been one of the deepest and most complex fighting game series around. And while that complexity is one of the things that has made it so beloved, it has also traditionally made it one of the harder series to get into from a beginner’s perspective. Guilty Gear Strive, however, sets out to address that in a number of ways without compromising the heart of what makes Guilty Gear, Guilty Gear. First off, big-damage combos aren’t nearly as hard to pull off as they have been in the past. Even just comboing a simple slash, heavy slash, overdrive combo can yield a humongous chunk of damage. The tradeoff is that landing these big combos is a bit more difficult because you can no longer convert substantial damage off of quick light attacks. The universal gatling system of punches cancelling into kicks, which cancel into slashes, which cancel into heavy slashes, which cancel into dust attacks is no longer present in Strive. Instead, if you want that combo damage, you’re going to have to find a way to land your beefier and slower attacks. It certainly creates a more deliberate pace and a more neutral-heavy style of gameplay, but I think it’s a great change that gives Strive its own unique feel and identity compared to other Guilty Gear games. And make no mistake, even despite that change in pace, this is still Guilty Gear, a series that throws many of the typical rules of fighting games out the window with unorthodox mechanics such as its signature Roman Cancels. That’s when you press three attack buttons to cancel the startup or recovery animations of nearly any attack at the cost of 50% of your tension meter. So for example, if you rush in with an unsafe move like, say, Sol’s Night Raid Vortex, you can use a Roman Cancel when it’s blocked to not only make yourself safe from punishment, but also leave yourself in a position to continue your offense. Or you could use a Roman Cancel to keep a combo going after Sol’s heavy slash, a move that normally isn’t cancellable into anything else. RCs are a Swiss army knife of utility, and that’s without even getting into the weeds of the differences between the red, blue, purple, and yellow varieties.   Strive’s version of Roman Cancels mostly function the same as they always have, with the exception of the fact that they are now much more pronounced, with a giant clock counting down the remaining time left of the slow down, and their shockwave now sending opponents slowly upwards, making it easier to follow up with aerials. New to Strive also is the ability to add a short directional dash during the pause of a Roman Cancel, which opens up the doors to all sorts of combo options that would be otherwise impossible because your character wouldn’t be in the right position to land the next attack. What it all boils down to is that Roman Cancels add a level of creativity to Guilty Gear’s combat that is nearly unprecedented in the realm of fighting games, and Strive iterates on the mechanic in thoughtful ways that make it feel fresh without ever messing too much with a great thing. Strive’s base roster of 15 characters is a great mix of longstanding veterans and returning fan favorites, bookended by two brand-new characters in Nagoriyuki and Giovanna. Nagoriyuki is one of the most interesting fighting game characters I’ve played in quite some time, combining the two disparate archetypes of the slow, hulking beast and the fast, unpredictable pressure machine, tied together by unique transformation that can just as easily kill himself as it can the opponent. Basically, his walk speed is extraordinarily slow, he doesn’t have a normal dash, and all of his regular moves hit extremely hard and from a long distance, but are exceptionally slow. However, he’s got a super-fast command dash and his special moves come out fairly quickly, with the unique property of being able to cancel into each other as much as you want, making it very hard to be able to tell when his pressure is going to end. The catch is that whenever he uses these special moves he causes his blood gauge to rise, and once it’s full he enters his Blood Rage state which makes him even more powerful, but also even less mobile, and drains his life super quickly. The only way to leave the Blood Rage state is by waiting for the time to expire (draining about half your life in the process) or by using a deadly overdrive attack that can leave him extremely vulnerable if blocked.  GIovanna, very much in contrast to Nagoriyuki, is a simple character with a simple gameplan: Get in your opponents face and never leave. She’s got really good normal attacks, an extremely fast dash that she can use to get in, tap your toes, and then smack your face with a roundhouse kick, a leaping cross-up split kick that leaves you at advantage on block, and absolutely ridiculous damage if she manages to catch you in close range. As someone who’s traditionally struggled to find a character that really gelled with me in the Guilty Gear series, Gio stood out as someone that I immediately understood and felt comfortable with. Plus, she’s got a dog. When looked at as a whole, 15 characters is not a ton, but considering how different they all are and the wide range of fighting styles that they cover, Strive’s roster feels bigger than it actually is. The returning roster all keep their general playstyles, but it’s awesome how they feel very much like all-new characters thanks to the new tools that they’ve received – and the ones that have been taken away. It’s not a stretch to say that Guilty Gear Strive is the best-looking 2D fighting game there’s ever been up to this point. ArcSystem Works has all but perfected the art of the 2D aesthetic using 3D models, and Guilty Gear Strive is quite simply its best showcase yet. Everything, from the smaller details like the way the sun rays hit and cast shadows on combatants, to the sheer amount of detail found in the backgrounds of each level, is astounding. Even when they’re just standing still, every character exudes personality in their idle animations, to say nothing of their actual movements and attacks. It’s a shame that Strive has no insta-kill super moves like there have been in previous Guilty Gear games, because they would no doubt be true spectacles to behold. And then there’s the soundtrack, which is “bull**** blazing,” as one might say. I think that’s a good thing? Let’s just say it’s a good thing. The vocals of the heavy rock soundtrack might not be for everyone, but fortunately, if you’re more of a fan of previous Guilty Gear games’ soundtracks, you can spend in-game currency to fish up old songs from previous games and set those as your background music. All this said, not everything in Strive is a stride forward. There’s no combo challenge mode anymore, which used to be a great tool to get familiar with a new character; the arcade mode no longer has its own character-specific intro and ending cutscenes, opting instead to just give some quick dialogue before the first and last fight, and having the story branch slightly depending on whether you win or lose key matches; and the mission mode feels bloated with a bunch of super-simple and basic lessons that feel like they’d be better taught in a mode that doesn’t force you to repeat the action five times. Still, the Mission Mode is worthy of praise, especially the later ones that introduce you to high-level fighting game concepts in ways that are easy to understand and give context to how they’d come up in an actual battle. Not to mention the character-specific matchup tips, like how to deal with May’s barrage of dolphins, Potemkin’s Hammer Fall, and Leo’s cross ups are incredibly helpful, and I wish more fighting games would include practice spaces like this. And finally, let’s address the online lobby situation: It’s not great. There’s definitely some charm to the 8-bit aesthetic, unlockable emotes, and customizable clothes you can equip to your avatar, but as something that you have to engage with at every level of online play, even for ranked play, it can be aggravating to deal with. But, it’s a blow that is softened by Strive’s actual netcode being stellar. All of my online matches with the review build have been pretty much flawless, and while the real test will be once the game is out in the wild, if my experience in the two open betas are any indication, Strive’s online play on a technical level is a giant step forward for ArcSys fighting games. Guilty Gear Strive is a milestone 2D fighting game that raises the bar for anime-like fighters in terms of its visuals, online netcode, and sheer creativity found in all aspects of its design. It’s definitely a different flavor of Guilty Gear, with a heavier focus on fighting in the neutral and a slightly slowed down pace, but it maintains the series soul with absolutely wild character designs, flexible combo system, and a level of creativity both in its presentation and mechanics that is second to none in the genre. &lt;p&gt;
The story of Guilty Gear, spanning over 20 years, will finally come to a conclusion in Guilty Gear Strive. The trials and tribulations of the series’ heroes and villains (including brand new characters joining fan favorites) will finally be resolved in this fully voiced story mode. Discover the astonishing truth awaiting at the end of all things. The cutting-edge 2D/3D hybrid graphics pioneered in the Guilty Gear series have been raised to the next level in Guilty Gear Strive. The new artistic direction and improve character animations will go beyond anything you’ve seen before in a fighting game! "
243,Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World ,5.0,"There was a time not too long ago where some games never left Japan. It didn’t matter if they were the next entry in a beloved series or some genre-twisting mashup. Monster World IV was one such game on the Sega Mega Drive, the last in a well-known series that for whatever reason never made it to the American Genesis like its predecessors did. Remade and released now as Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World, this formerly 16-bit classic retains everything that fans loved about the series back in 1994. Unfortunately, it is no longer 1994, and this dedication to old-school platforming fundamentals makes Asha’s adventure a museum piece rather than a triumphant resurgence. Like the retro original, Asha in Monster World carries on mechanically from previous Monster World games but presents a brand-new journey with only a few ties to the ongoing story. Asha was born with a gift to sense spirits, and their cries for help serve as a call to adventure. Over the course of around five hours, Asha saves a quartet of helpful sprites that series fans may remember from Wonder Boy in Monster World and foils the shadowy plot to contain them. It’s a simple tale that works for a colorful platformer like this, providing good motivation without getting in the way of the action.  Improving a classic like this seems like a slam dunk, and general nostalgia for the 1990s has produced a bunch of remasters and remakes that breathe new life into old favorites. In the case of Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World, a new coat of paint can’t hide simplistic gameplay and outdated mechanics. Asha in Monster World is a straightforward action game featuring a hero whose moveset consists of a single sword swing, a rechargeable “magic hit” for extra damage, a shield for defense, and aerial attacks that go up and down. The only other interactions in each level come from Asha’s floating puffball of a pet, a fantastical creature known as a Pepelogoo that Asha can throw to retrieve items located off-screen, push buttons, or climb up plumes of lava. Grabbing onto its feet is also the only way to perform a double jump. It’s a wide variety of moves when compared to other Genesis action games, but it’s crushingly limited compared to most similar games we see nowadays. Take the double jump in particular: Monster World’s four levels take full advantage of this extra height once Asha learns the move, laying out paths that need you to make several in a row to proceed. In most games, this means simply hitting the jump button twice, but in Asha’s adventure, there’s an extra button press and a time buffer whenever she needs the Pepelogoo to give her some added distance. The creature also evolves over time and gets too heavy for Asha, forcing her to stand still as she holds onto her pet instead of running around freely. To modern eyes, all this fiddling with Pepelogoo to accomplish jumps that almost any other platforming hero could easily clear feels less like interesting design and more like a simple waste of time, and it’s not the only instance of this. The levels have plenty of examples of backtracking for simplistic puzzles, rote memorization, and times where a needed key spawns directly next to a locked door. These are the type of gameplay elements that games left behind for a reason, and they’re the biggest cause of why Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World doesn’t stand up to modern scrutiny. The physical edition of Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World comes with an English edition of the 1994 game. It’s a great bonus, and it’s a shame that not everyone has access to it. It’s only when playing each version side by side can you see how faithful the developers are to the original. It’s a shot-for-shot remake in the vein of Zack Snyder’s Watchmen, only with a layer of cartoony cel-shading instead of pixels. I had just as much fun during my six- or seven-hour playthrough of Wonder Boy: The Dragon’s Trap as I have with many of its contemporary counterparts. While its antiquated roots cause some minor frustration with unreliable hitboxes and unnecessary grinding, the foundational combat and exploration is still engaging and fun after 30 years. From long-time Wonder Boy fans to platformer enthusiasts who’ve never heard of it until now, you’ll likely be able to find whimsical fun and a neat bit of genre history in this charming adventure. Different people will prefer different styles, but the original presentation put me more in the right mindset for what was to come. The new graphical treatment might set expectations for a game that’s evolved from its original era, and that makes simple things like the lack of mid-level checkpoints and limited healing items all the more frustrating. If you do happen to prefer the newer look of the Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap remake and the spiritual sequel Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom, it’s worth noting that Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World’s modern graphics are a significant downgrade from both of those games. The bright colors and simple designs all mirror the classic well, but there’s no style to the translation. The simplicity makes Asha’s world look like a cheap Wonder Boy knockoff rather than a long-lost entry in the series. Thankfully, it’s not all doom and gloom for the new version, which does include a few colorful cutscenes that expand on important moments in the story in fun ways. NPC dialogue scrolls at a much more reasonable pace when compared to the original, which makes the forward-thinking meta humor in the town square all the more enjoyable. The soundtrack is also improved with many renditions of a main theme, although it can get repetitive on some of the longer levels. Despite a few bright spots, it’s hard to recommend Wonder Boy: Asha in Monster World to anyone who’s not already invested in some way in this old-school platformer series. This is an authentic remake to be sure, but it’s bogged down in outdated design and new graphics that are hit and miss at best. Anyone who’s explored the world of retro games knows that there are plenty of skippable entries in any console’s library, and Asha’s journey will go down as such on Nintendo Switch and PS4. "
244,Necromunda: Hired Gun ,5.0,"Necromunda is the kind of game that makes me appreciate when developers are given the time they need to really polish a game to a shine, because this is what happens when they aren’t. It’s a fast-paced, gore-filled shooter in the same vein as Doom Eternal with a Warhammer flavor and some RPG elements thrown in, and combat is brutal, violent and often satisfying... but also sloppy and buggy. You’ll see yourself and others phase through the environment, slide around the level during melee animations before popping back into place, and even experience a hard crash or two when your skills are just too much for Necromunda to handle. All of that really sucks the fun out of what should be a great time. You can see the potential of the gunplay in the moments where things come together – especially when you find a weapon that fits your playstyle well or you use Necromunda’s insane mobility to take out the bad guys in some really awesome way. Between midair dashing, double-jumping, and your grappling hook you can glide across massive areas in seconds and take out enemies with extreme precision. Most of the weapons feel great, from powerful shotguns that turn people into red giblets at close range to heavy weapons that can tear through enemies and scarcely need to be aimed.   As you find or purchase better loot and discover a build that fits your playstyle you can go nuts with some insane builds, like carrying around multiple shotguns and maximizing your mobility so you can zip around the map and blast baddies in the face, or a sniper-focused build where you focus your equipment on improving your odds of getting powerful loot drops. You also get a dog companion who can be summoned with a squeak toy to attack enemies, which is pretty entertaining. She isn’t the most useful in a fight, since you’ll likely be moving a mile a minute and flying through the air and your dog mostly wanders around, but at least she sometimes succeeds in drawing the enemies’ attention. She can also be upgraded too, which lets her receive and deal more damage, making her marginally more useful, and there are some interesting cosmetic changes as each cybernetic implant gradually transforms your normal household pup into a robotic terror cyber doggo. And yes, you can pet the dog.  All that sounds great, but in practice there are far too many major problems with Necromunda, and the longer I played the more they got in the way of me feeling like a badass. For one, the enemies’ AI is about as sharp as a grape and they’ll mostly just run at you screaming or get caught on something and stand there until you kill them. Or worse, they often hilariously spawn right in front of you for your murdering convenience. Some boss fights just have enemies awkwardly popping into existence without end until the boss is killed. And some of Necromunda’s design choices are just puzzling. For example, the lion’s share of enemies can be instantly killed with a melee attack, a la Doom’s glory kills. Doing so locks you into an animation for several seconds, during which time you’re completely invulnerable. Because the AI are a bunch of helpless goobers, more often than not they’ll run up to you while you’re assassinating one enemy, giving you the perfect opportunity to simply melee kill them with the press of a button as well. Hysterically, this sometimes leads to the bad guys literally forming a line in front of you waiting for their turn to be gruesomely butchered. It certainly doesn’t help that Necromunda has a hard time keeping up with you when things get intense. Screen tearing and framerate dips are quite common, even on my high end PC (which has a GeForce RTX 2080ti GPU and Ryzen 9 CPU), and it’s at its worst when you’re moving fast or in an area with especially high enemy density. I even experienced a few full-on crashes where I’d find myself staring at my desktop wallpaper and sighing at the progress I’d lost. There’s no interesting story to carry it through the rough parts, either, as Necromunda’s plot seems doomed almost from the start. The problem is foreshadowed the title itself: “Hired Gun” isn’t a term that lends itself well to a very personal story and Necromunda lives up to that expectation. As a mercenary, your character is as shallow as can be and has almost no personal stake in any of the events throughout the campaign. Most quests start out with someone telling you about someone who needs killing. Your character replies with a short comment that usually amounts to wanting to be rich, then you’re off to commit some war crimes. NPCs are equally shallow with precisely zero memorable characters or reasons to pay much attention to what’s happening with the story. The plot borders on being actually nonsensical in parts and cutscenes are filled with truly unremarkable dialogue and awkward explanations with little payoff. Most involve characters monologuing at you or having two characters exchange words while you...kinda just watch. Your character matters so little in all that’s happening, in fact, that enemies will shout “kill him” even if you’re playing as a woman. It’s disappointing because this all takes place in Warhammer’s bonkers sci-fi world where humanity has grown unchecked into something monstrous and unrecognizable. Instead of using the appealing setting to its advantage, Necromunda largely uses it as decoration for mindless action and gore. There’s nothing wrong with turning your brain off for awhile and enjoying some meaningless slaughter (in a video game, anyway), but it certainly feels like wasted potential given all the lore and worldbuilding Warhammer 40K has going for it, and Necromunda frankly needed all the help it could get.  That said, the sights you’ll see along the way are actually quite impressive. Each level is massive and provides plenty of opportunity to wall-run and grapple across rooms as you conduct your orchestra of destruction. You’ll see massive metal trains, creepy, derelict structures, and even an obligatory sewer level, each with plenty of nooks and crannies hiding loot to be claimed and enemies to be slaughtered. The campaign is short and ends with such little fanfare it actually made me laugh, but there are lots of side quests and repeatable content to keep you looting and shooting for much longer than the six to eight hours the main missions offer. You can replay campaign levels to improve your ranking or grind for loot, or tackle side quests to earn extra money. Side quests reuse areas from the campaign and amount to little more than short bounties to “kill 10 of this enemy type,” but many are at least more challenging than the story missions and offer enough credits to make it worth your while. The good news is that the RPG mechanics behind the weapons, equipment, and cybernetic upgrades are pretty great for the most part, which makes grinding a worthwhile endeavor. Some cybernetic upgrades offer game-changing abilities, like a shockwave that stuns nearby enemies or the ability to teleport short distances to deliver melee attacks, but most are smaller perks like increased damage resistance or better stability when shooting while wallrunning. Necromunda: Hired Gun has an iconic setting, lots of gore, and great mobility and gunplay, but it keeps giving you reasons to not play it. Whether it's the technical issues, the hopelessly dim AI, or a story that’s as bland as a barn door and comically short, you have to be willing to overlook a towering pile of aggravating problems in order to appreciate what this RPG shooter does well. "
245,Knockout City ,9.0,"Knockout City isn’t the dodgeball from your childhood. It’s an intense team-based multiplayer take on the grade school sport that combines simple, easy to pick up controls, with deceptively complex tactics and strategies that may be surprising coming from a game featuring this type of Saturday morning cartoon aesthetic. Its crisp, satisfying gameplay and multiplayer duels deliver all of the highs of gym class sports without the smelly uniforms or the anxiety of being picked last. I’ve found the art style to be an acquired taste. The Bratz doll look of the characters was off-putting at first, but taken with the colorful cityscapes, the genre-defying energy of the soundtrack, and eclectic customization options, Knockout City has a charm that’s hard to deny. I love the distinctive sound each of the different balls makes when they collide with targets, particularly that hollow and familiar “bonk” of the standard red rubber variety.   The base rules of this sport are simple: your team of three or four has to eliminate the opposing team by clobbering them with balls that spawn across the maps. Players must be hit twice to be knocked out, and the first team to 10 knockouts wins. When a ball is in your hand, you're almost like a baseball pitcher in that there’s a shot selection aspect to every throw you make as you attempt to break your opponent’s defense, which is a simple yet powerful catch. The basic throw can be charged to a faster variation, you can throw a slow lob that can change the opponent’s timing just enough to throw them off, or you can throw wide curve balls to reach around obstacles and exploit enemy blind spots. Winning a duel is much more about that choice than it is about precision – since all aim is auto-targeted, having great on-the-run aim like in a traditional third-person shooter is a non-factor. Instead, every interaction is a matter of having better reflexes and more devious tactics in focused, tennis-like volley exchanges. Knockout City is only sort of free-to-play – if you want to play past street level 25, you’ll have to drop $20 – so it may be disconcerting to see that it also has microtransactions. But they're the largely inoffensive kind: everything that can be bought with the in-game currency, holobux, can also be earned by raising your “street level.” You gain experience points by simply playing matches, but you’ll gain them in far greater quantities by completing contracts, which have you doing things like taunting the enemy right before you eliminate them. If you’re patient and persistent, you can get every cosmetic Knockout City has to offer without paying more than the sticker price. Among the strangest and most effective moves is ignoring balls completely, and instead turning yourself into one for your teammates to throw. When you “ball up” you can be tossed to eliminate opponents like normal, or supercharged to become a sort of living, guided mortar shell. These UItimate Throws cause a devastating explosion on impact, knocking out anyone caught in the blast instantly. Using players as balls is risky, though. You can be caught like any other ball and thrown back against your team, or worse, thrown off the stage for an instant knockout. And of course, should you miss with a big Ultimate Throw, you are super exposed to counter attack. Some of the more advanced techniques, like passes that charge the ball to max speed faster or dashes that double as powerful tackles that deflect throws and disarm opponents, provide great depth that high-skill players are already starting to make use of. I’m just scratching the surface of that after a few dozen games, never going too long without using a trick shot or an Ultimate Throw to gain an advantage in a close game. Not only do all of these little maneuvers feel easy and accessible, but they all feel necessary for true dodgebrawl mastery. Most of the stages do a great job at throwing unique environmental wrinkles into the standard play. I quickly found a favorite stage in Galaxy Burger, which features a circular spinning restaurant that begs you to make wild trick throws inside it. The Roundabout adds cars to the mix, forcing you to stay on the move at all times or get bounced around by rush hour traffic. Of course, not every gimmick becomes something worth playing around, like the transporting tubes in Back Alley Brawl, but they don’t detract from the action either. The special balls that spawn during games have a far more dramatic impact on gameflow from match to match. Sniper balls turn games into more long-range affairs, as players can hang back and launch high speed throws from afar. Multi-balls give you three throws instead of one, turning players into rapid-fire ballers for a limited time. I love that these options are so clearly worth playing around that they can change the pace of a game by their mere presence. For instance, when I hear the ticking of a Bomb Ball, I’m far less likely to stick close to teammates just in case they become ground zero for a sudden explosion. Knockout City’s matchmaking is a bit wonky, though. Especially in unranked Street Play, where I’ve regularly joined games mid match only to find that my whole team has already gone idle, leaving me alone to get walloped by the enemy. Pickup games are at the mercy of the random people you’re playing with, which may not give you a fair shot. Should you need a break from the standard gameplay, Knockout City offers rotating game modes that get shuffled every week that put interesting spins on the rules. One added a sort of gold rush system where every hit causes enemies to drop diamonds that you collect to score instead of simply chasing knockouts. My favorite mode removed all the balls completely, forcing players to throw their teammates at each other instead. Ultimately, these modes are fun distractions but never more alluring than the standard three-versus-three matches for very long. Knockout City is one of the best team-based PvP games to come out in years. It's a fresh take on the American schoolyard staple that proves that lowering the mechanical bar for entry doesn’t have to come at the cost of deep tactical gameplay. Every match has the potential to be a dynamic “combat” experience that even the most hard-boiled shooter fan can appreciate, all thanks to the clever balance between throws and catches, exciting special balls, and well-designed maps to brawl through. "
246,Biomutant ,6.0,"Biomutant is an imaginative, single-player action-RPG set against a post-post-apocalypse where tiny mammals have become martial arts masters. Think TMNT, but instead of turtles Splinter found a ferret, a guinea pig, someone’s cat, and Gizmo from Gremlins. These weird-looking mutant animals have inherited an Earth in danger of ending all over again – but not before they learnt to walk upright and build guns. However, while Biomutant is buoyed by some fantastic enemy creature designs and boasts a deep well of combat options and customisable weapons, these successes are married to some fairly basic and repetitive objectives, quests, and puzzles, as well as a story that seems to regularly overstate its own substance.   If you’re thinking that trekking around a vibrant and varied open world filled with strange creatures and primitive civilisations trying to stave off a second Armageddon sounds a little similar to Sony’s esteemed Horizon: Zero Dawn, you’re on the right track; Horizon: Zero Dawn with rodents isn’t exactly the worst description for Biomutant. Hell, it even features a robot horse. Horizon is far from the only influence on Biomutant, though, because it appears to scrape inspiration from a wide assortment of sources, from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild’s extreme temperature zones to the seemingly infinite array of weapon combinations of Borderlands, and from Devil May Cry’s cocktail of gun combat and hack ’n slash to… Kung Fu Panda. That last one is probably fairly self-explanatory. To its credit, the way Biomutant fuses all its components together has resulted in something that is actually unique, at least broadly speaking. It’s certainly the only open-world post-post-apocalyptic kung fu action RPG starring anthropomorphic animals I’ve ever played. The key disappointment is that the structure of the actual game that all these ingredients have been injected into is anything but unique, with objectives and tasks overtly recycled or riffed upon mission after mission. The first several hours are probably the worst offenders, even though it’s engaging at first. The clever character creation system is a bit like a genetic dartboard, automatically adjusting your hero’s appearance depending on what core stats you want to bolster before diving in. Additionally, there are a bunch of available character classes that will define your avatar’s initial appearance. As a meathead with an aversion to magic I opted for a Commando build for a focus on firepower and ended up with a character that looked a bit like Sylvester Stallone’s cat after an exclusive diet of plutonium-laced Fancy Feast and Rambo movies – but if you want some kind of pink, warlock mouse, Biomutant has your back. After it walked me through its linear intro and deposited me into the open world, Biomutant seems to spin its wheels a bit. Choosing a tribe to ally with locks you into certain goals: uniting or conquering the tribes, and either saving the Tree of Life or letting it die. Either way, the enemy base conquest mission thread quickly unfurls to reveal that it’s largely just a series of repeated sequences and recycled vignettes. There’s no real flexibility when it comes to conquering outposts – and invisible walls will stop you if you try to come at it from another angle. You can only tackle them via a rigid series of encounters repeated from tribe to tribe and base to base whether you’re trying to unite the tribes or conquer them. I’ve worked for a peaceful tribe whose leader warned me against causing collateral damage and, in New Game +, an evil tribe who demanded mayhem, and the process involves lighting exactly the same amount of hay on fire. An even bigger letdown came later, as I began to tackle Biomutant’s four key ‘Worldeater’ bosses. The boss fights are identical whether you’re trying to stop them eating the Tree of Life or you’re trying to let them eat it; they just come back to life and keep on munching, making the whole encounter pointless. Preparation for each boss tends to follow a consistent formula: gather a bunch of parts for a vehicle and catch five tiny creatures that you’ll later be able to launch at these bosses as distractions. A lot of Biomutant is just collecting stuff, and collecting stuff just… isn’t that interesting after a while. It’s a shame the missions and objectives feel stale so quickly because the world itself is very impressive. There’s a great sense of grand scale, particularly with things like the enormous Tree of Life and landmarks like collapsing bridges and a decaying dam. It’s extremely varied, too, from thick forest to scorching desert, and fluorescent radioactive zones to barren wastelands.  They’re filled with enemies with truly fantastic character designs, and there are so many different types of rival creatures and crazy mutant animals to battle – large and small. My first run through Biomutant took just over 20 hours, and yet even by the end of that I was still encountering enemies I’d never seen before, from killer plants to giant furry monsters wearing pyjamas. They’re not always particularly smart and can be prone to getting hung up on obstacles, trapped on ledges, or stuck in rooms, but the range of enemy types is terrific. There’s also an impressive range of choices for fighting them. Biomutant supports a vast pile of different combat options, so many that it feels unlikely two friends would find themselves taking identical approaches. For most of my playthrough I went with a strict focus on a mighty two-handed melee weapon, a heavily-upgraded automatic rifle, and a couple of powers I’d found useful, including levitation, a ground pound that spews out toxic waste, and a supernatural rapid-dash move. I’m sure you’ll gravitate towards entirely different perks, considering you have everything from ice powers to bouncy mutant mushrooms to choose from. I don’t know if I can say all the powers are different enough to profoundly shift up the moment-to-moment combat but having the agency to pick perks that, for instance, got me off the ground and out of danger when necessary definitely suited my playstyle.  Button mashing is sufficient to a point but to execute cool combos and juggles a little more finesse is required. I did find it extremely frustrating, however, whenever I’d backtrack over an invisible line during a combat encounter and the enemy I was fighting would break off their attack and have their health reset to full, regardless of how low it was. It’s something that only happened a handful of times but it was a baffling problem to have. Everything about Biomutant is a bit weird, so it should come as no surprise that its story is very strangely delivered. Beyond what appears to be the good and evil halves of your character’s conscience, which irregularly pop up for some idle banter amongst themselves, all of the dialogue is delivered by a single narrator who explains the world and translates NPC dialogue. It’s initially kind of quaint, though I found it a bit wearisome over time. It’s not so much the narrator’s random interjections; it’s more that his regular attempts at profundity write a lot of cheques that a game that’s really just about hamsters bashing the crap out of each other with toilet brushes struggles to cash. Biomutant seems to have a lot it wants to say about the past, the future – and possibly forgiveness – but its fortune cookie wisdom feels a fraction too earnest. The writing itself also swings drastically between overly verbose to gratingly child-like, and eventually I began to find it a bit much. One minute the narrator is waxing philosophical about the ever-branching and beautiful ramifications of the Tree of Life, and the next he’s telling me all about porky puffs and pong paddles and pling plong booths. I suspect a lot of folks may probably have more stamina for this that me – and you can dial it back to dialogue and mission critical notes only – but either way I think it leans a little too hard into its toddler neologisms and the result sounds a bit like someone forced Sir David Attenborough to narrate In The Night Garden, the BBC’s bafflingly impenetrable, Teletubbies-on-acid kids show that only makes sense to preschoolers and Teletubbies fans who do acid.   With excellent enemy creature design, a rich and diverse world, and piles and piles of choice when it comes to combat and customisation, Biomutant has a lot of the building blocks of a top-drawer action RPG. It’s really missing only a few, but they’re big ones: its cookie-cutter approach to objectives and puzzles feels two-or-so generations off the pace of other open-world action games, and that leaves the quest to gather all of the things feeling repetitive early on.

247,Mass Effect Legendary Edition Review Part 1: Mass Effec,8.0, Unsurprisingly, EA’s 4K remaster of the first Mass Effect is a night-and-day difference from the 2007 original. One look at a side-by-side comparison tells you most of what you need to know about this upgrade: textures, character models, and effects have been retrofitted and everything runs at 60 frames per second or more, though animations show their age in places, especially on human faces. But to find out how this famed but notoriously uneven game plays in 2021, factoring in the gameplay tweaks in the Legendary Edition, I spent 30 hours on a full playthrough. Revisiting an RPG I hadn’t played since 2008 turned out to be a fantastic refresher on one of gaming’s best original science-fiction universes, and also a reminder of the mechanical weaknesses a lot of us were willing to overlook at the time because of how revolutionary Mass Effect was back then. In general, Mass Effect looks good at 4K. (I played on Xbox Series X.) Environments are a tad on the sparse side when it comes to how spread out everything is, but textures are sharp and detailed and the lighting effects look respectably modern. Its biggest weakness – visually – is its facial animations, which are hard to ignore considering how much you see of them. In contrast to their detailed and well-lit skin, a lot of human characters look like their faces are paralyzed between their upper lip and their eyes. Sometimes those eyes have an uncomfortable, unblinking gaze. It’s not terrible but it definitely stands out next to current games. However, the nice thing about aliens is that they’re immune to the uncanny valley effect because for all we know that’s how their faces are supposed to look – so they mostly look excellent.   What comes out of their mouths, though, has held up brilliantly. Mass Effect’s voice cast is outstanding, especially Jennifer Hale as the female version of Shepard. The supporting characters have plenty of recognizable voices, including Keith David, Seth Green, and Star Trek: The Next Generation veterans Marina Sirtis and Dwight Schultz. Naturally it’s all but impossible to have a 30-hour game without a few low points in the voice work here and there, but the prominent characters are all extremely well done.   Meanwhile, Saren is a strong villain who comes across as both a monstrous traitor and at times somewhat sympathetic. He’s certainly evil from the jump, but as you learn more about him you find that he has beliefs that drive him and an argument to support them – even if it’s one that no sane person would get on board with. (I remember the first time I played, which was relatively soon after Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, I was annoyed that Shepard couldn’t choose to accept Saren’s offer to join him. In hindsight, I can see how that might’ve been an issue for the sequels.) On top of that, it’s simply astonishing how much worldbuilding is crammed into this first game without any of it seeming like a giant exposition dump. Through conversations, both aboard the Normandy between missions and with dozens of characters on the worlds we visit, we learn the interconnected and complex histories of the Krogan, the Salarians, the Quarians, the Turians, the Asari, the Geth, and more, and all of it is used to build up tension in the uneasy alliance of species that governs the galaxy from the shiny white Citadel station. When bad blood bubbles up between characters of different species, it all makes perfect sense. Revelations come at a pace that keeps the energy up, and I’ve rarely seen a universe feel so thoroughly fleshed out so quickly. Also, the frequent criticism of the unchecked police power of the Specters feels relevant today, too (though its embrace of the idea that only a good space cop can stop a bad space cop may not please everybody).    Combat isn’t much of a highlight. To its credit, The Legendary Edition has smoothed things out a bit with improved aiming, shorter ability cooldowns, a revamped interface, and the ability to direct your two squad members individually. You do get some moments of intensity when you’re being pinned down by enemy fire and taking potshots at them. Also, Shepard can now use any weapon regardless of your class, which occasionally comes in handy. But the AI is barely there, to the point where you’ll see certain enemies moving in clearly predefined patterns, so they’re not exactly tactically interesting fights that really require you to make use of all of your squad’s abilities. As long as you’re periodically updating your squad’s gear with the slightly improved but still slow and clunky inventory system there aren’t many battles that are likely to slow you down much on normal difficulty. I played on the new default Legendary mode, which just means you’re only prompted to stop and put in upgrade points half as often as in the still-available Classic mode – and it still felt like it happened a lot. I preferred it this way because most individual points only give you a negligible stat boost; this way you can usually put in enough points to unlock something new when you level up. The original Mass Effect has a lot more old-school RPG stats than its sequels, but it’s not like it’s asking you to crunch any intimidating numbers – just pick which skills of your chosen class to boost and unlock. I wish there were more room to make my Shepard feel like a build I chose within my class, because I had enough skill points to max out nearly everything by the end and that made it feel homogenous.   Some other annoyances from the original version have been toned down to the point where you have to wonder why they’re even there at all. The hacking minigame, for instance, is the same simple Simon Says button-pushing routine from the original Xbox version (as opposed to the “Frogger” one from the PC version) except that failing is entirely consequence-free – you can try again instead of resorting to spending your omni-gel currency to unlock it (or reloading a save). In fact, in my entire playthrough I never used omni-gel to hack anything once. The Legendary Edition’s version of the original Mass Effect updates the first game of BioWare’s amazing sci-fi RPG trilogy enough that a modern audience can play through it and enjoy its spectacular story and characters without being asked to suffer much for the privilege. Combat and driving sections are still lackluster, but a universe this dense with rich lore and consequential decisions is a pleasure to come back to and to welcome newcomers into. After replaying, I’m surprised at how much I’m looking forward to diving into the next two games – stay tuned for those reviews. "
248,Hood: Outlaws &amp; Legends ,6.0, As game premises go, it’s really hard to beat Hood: Outlaws &amp; Legends. A Robin Hood fantasy heist game where you and a crew of outlaws steal from the heavily guarded fortresses of the rich and give it to the poor? Sign me and all my friends the heck up! But where this breathtaking world of assassins and knights delivers some awesome moments, sadly, it seems designed to reward bullheaded brute-force attacks over cunning stealth and doesn’t have nearly enough content to sustain the interest of the greedy swindlers it aims to please.   Each of the four characters on a team has a distinct role and set of abilities that can prove invaluable under the right circumstances (though you can use any team composition you like). Robin the Ranger, for example, is an archer class who can silently kill enemies from afar and open up new paths on the map via rope arrows that others can climb. On the opposite end of the spectrum is John the Brawler, a melee tank who can use his beefy lumberjack arms to open gates for his allies and is able to carry the treasure chest faster than any other class.  And therein lies one of the main issues with Hood: stealth isn’t rewarding enough and embracing open battle isn’t punished enough. Inevitably, this means that as soon as the enemy teams meet one another, subterfuge gives way to an all-out street brawl. No matter how long you hold out, though, almost every match I’ve played has ended in a drawn-out extraction sequence where opposing teams fight for control of a winch they must crank to make off with the loot. This phase can drag on for more than 10 minutes of stalemated combat where the teams are recklessly killing each other while slow and stupid NPCs meander around, slashing at anyone who gets close. Compare that to stealing the key and breaking into the vault, which can take only a few minutes and can be feasibly accomplished while in stealth – it’s a bit lopsided.  Don’t get me wrong: wild, reckless combat can be a lot of fun, but it also shatters part of the Robin Hood fantasy by trivializing stealth. In one instance, my friends and I decided to throw caution to the wind and run with a full group of John the Brawler heavy tanks. We didn’t even aspire to stealth and openly attacked every enemy in sight, and yet we were able to steal the key, break into the vault, and make off with the treasure before the opposing team even knew what hit them. When it came to the combat-heavy escape phase, our John Squad™ (John Connery, Kim John-Un, John Claude Van Damme, and John of the Dead) easily overwhelmed our naively balanced opponents for the fatal sin of playing as intended. That just felt wrong! Another frustrating aspect of the way Hood rewards its players (or rather, how it doesn’t), is that the winning team is declared when one side successfully extracts the chest, which oftentimes feels arbitrary. For example, one team can steal the key, crack open the vault, bring the chest to the extraction point and winch is 90% of the way up, only for the opposing team to kill them and finish the final 10% and be declared the winner. It’s actually a completely valid strategy to let the opposing team do all the work and simply snake out the treasure from under their noses – and the potential for that kind of upset certainly adds to the tension – but not when combat is balanced the way it is right now. This is especially painful when your team goes out of their way to be ultimate students of the shadow and executes the heist with skill and precision, only to lose to a bunch of big dumb Johns.   What makes the combat-dominant meta all the more frustrating is that stealth in Hood is actually really well done and very satisfying. Sneaking around and working together to take out a trio of guards all at the same time makes me feel like a complete badass, and stealing the key right out from under the guards’ noses with a well-placed smoke bomb is enormously fulfilling. The assassination animations and accompanying sound effects are a stealth-lover’s ASMR, which made me want to avoid the more rewarding direct assault style that Hood encourages even to my own detriment. Of course, my team and I had a good amount of fun in the process of discovering these balance issues, so they’re not something that would turn me away from a game on their own. Each of the five maps are unique and beautifully designed, from a vast and, murky swamp to a bleak, claustrophobic graveyard. Learning the areas and tracking down the randomly generated key and vault locations at the beginning of each match is a thrill, especially as your eyes dart back and forth in search of the rival gang you know can’t be far off. Marking enemies, coordinating a plan of attack over game chat, and working together as a unit is an absolute blast. And when all Hell breaks loose when your team is caught by guards or ambushed by rival players, the slow methodical pace gives way to utter carnage as you scramble to smash a hammer over someone’s head before they can put an arrow through you.   The only thing you can do besides the standard 4v4 Heist mode is play Training mode, which simply removes the team of enemy players so your team can hone your skills. Training is not only even more repetitive given the lack of PvP variable, but also unrewarding as you’re not given much XP or gold for playing it. A year-one content roadmap has already been revealed, which includes a new game mode and a new character, but without an infusion of new maps I’m not convinced that will solve the problem. One thing I really appreciate is that Hood turns game chat on by default, even for those who are already in party chat, meaning matchmade teams can hear and communicate with their randomly assigned teammates very easily. This wild west kind of game chat hasn’t been seen much since the early days of Halo and is something that’s always bothered me about multiplayer games that seemingly expect you to come with your own crew or suffer defeat at the hands of those with more friends than you. Even better, you can hear the enemy team talk when in proximity to them or before the match begins, which can lead to some entertaining interactions and trash talk. Of course, if you’re shy or bothered by overly chatty people you can turn this off, but I’d encourage you to be social! Hood: Outlaws &amp; Legends is a stealth-action game with an interesting PvPvE premise that leads to some exciting moments of chaos when your well-planned heist goes awry. Its downfall, however, is that its balance rewards hacking and slashing over stealth and planning. Even if you embrace that, there just aren’t enough maps to sustain the single mode for more than a handful of hours before things become repetitive. "
249,Subnautica: Below Zero ,9.0, The original Subnautica is one of those games I wish I could wipe from my memory so that I could plunge in and comb its depths for the first time all over again. No one’s worked out how to do that without some pretty severe side effects, but Subnautica: Below Zero is the next best thing: even though it’s a bit smaller, it gives us a whole new watery sector to explore, survive, craft, and build awesome bases in, and it’s just as exhilarating.   As you track down abandoned Alterra facilities and use context clues and voice logs to piece together what happened, you'll get to unlock and play with new technology like the spy pengling, an adorable little robot that can access areas Robin can't. Combat is still pretty limited, especially in the water, but that's by design. It would take a lot of the sense of danger out of Subnautica if you could just bolt a machine gun onto your suit. It's much more fun to have to sneak by or outrun the giant ice worms and sea monsters that serve as guardians to some key story areas and valuable resources.    ""Subnautica is a template for what open-world survival games should strive to be. It’s fantastical, fresh, and frightening from surface to seabed, with a story that kept on surprising me and a cast of sea monsters that quite literally haunted my dreams. Even with more than 50 hours sunk, I have yet to discover all of its secrets. It’s a testament to how enticing those secrets are that I’m willing to face my fears and plunge my submersible into the darkest corners of its unforgiving ocean again and again."" - Leana Hafer, January 25, 2018   The sound design and music are also just as awesome as ever. The icy, oppressive, yet beckoning feeling of the Arctic sea really comes alive when you can hear the distant calls of massive oceanic life forms and the bubbling of your rebreather through the shimmering gloom. I got to the point that I could close my eyes and make a rough mental map of what kind of creatures were around, including their relative position and distance – which is not only useful but pretty damn impressive that it's possible at all in such a huge, 3D environment.  The upside of this is that there’s less empty space, and every area has been given a lot of love. Almost every corner of the glacier and the sea floor has something interesting going on, and there are some very elaborate hidden areas to explore. iframe allowautoplay="""" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/gallery/46207/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery46207"" scrolling=""no""> Below Zero's gameplay feels instantly familiar, but has gotten some nice touch-ups across the board. Gone are the zippy Seamoth and the colossal Cyclops submersibles. Instead, you get the rugged Sea Truck, a modular vehicle that can be equipped with extra storage, a crafting station, and a docking bay for the trusty Prawn Suit. This lets you operate an entirely mobile base, while also giving you the option to detach the cabin and pilot it independently when you really need speed. There's a good helping of new stationary base modules, too, for building and decorating your own deep sea research station or party pad. Subnautica: Below Zero is another big, frosty bite of one of the best open world survival games to come along since the genre's inception. It might not be as massive as the original, but there is so much style and substance packed into each trench, cave, and bloodthirsty shark-squid-thing that it's hard to complain. New vehicles, new gadgets, and across-the-board tune ups to technical performance and quality of life round out the experience skillfully. Whether you were ravenous for more Subnautica like me, or don't even know what you're in for, I don't think you'll be disappointed. "
250,sident Evil Village ,8.0, As soon as I arrived in Resident Evil Village’s sinister rural setting, its Resident Evil 4 influence reared its snarling head. Almost immediately surrounded by rabid Lycan locals, I scrambled for shotgun shells and bookshelves to block doorways as the horde closed in, only to be saved a split-second away from death. It’s an intense welcome that serves as a fantastic flashback to the opening of Shinji Mikami’s magnum-toting magnum opus, and one made all the more frantic in first-person perspective. Resident Evil Village might not break much new ground in its own right, but it successfully grafts Resident Evil 4’s best action elements onto the series’ more modern form established in Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, making for a genuinely engrossing and increasingly combat-heavy continuation of the Ethan Winters story.   All four report to the mysterious head witch, Mother Miranda, and although admittedly none of them managed to coax out the same kind of genuine scares as the southern-fried psychopaths in Resident Evil 7's Baker family, I found the lot of them to be entertainingly twisted in a slightly cartoonish, Batman villain kind of way. Each presides over their own visually distinctive domain that you must survive, from the opulent gold-trimmed interiors of Castle Dimitrescu to the grungy mechanical works of Heisenberg’s subterranean facility. There are noticeable shifts in mood between each setting, with one demanding a more stealth-driven approach while another leans more into psychological horror than combat. Delving into the darkest corners of Village’s world and uncovering the real reason these fairytale freaks have come into existence in the present day made for a compelling mystery that hooked me throughout my 10-hour playthrough. Aside from the aforementioned Lycans – which come in multiple forms – there are zombie ghouls, flying gargoyles, full-on werewolves, and more waiting to ambush you at every turn. Their onslaught feels like an aggressive response to one of Resident Evil 7’s most notable shortcomings in the lack of variety in its enemy types; its handful of lumbering monsters were referred to as the ‘Mold’, an appropriate name, since they quickly grew stale. Village remedies this by throwing a significantly broader set of nasties into your crosshairs; in fact, the last time there was a line-up of village people this diverse they were singing disco songs about the YMCA. Granted, most of these enemies aren’t particularly clever in their own right – the genetically modified mutants of Heisenberg’s factory might have deadly drills for arms, but they’re far from  the sharpest tools in the shed when it comes to outmanoeuvring you one-on-one. Still, what Village’s variety of grunts may lack in smarts they certainly make up for in sheer numbers, and although I rarely encountered clusters of more than a handful enemies at a time for the first few hours (outside of the initial overwhelming village reception), at somewhere around its midpoint the size of these enemy swarms started to swell substantially. By the story’s end I was gleefully indulging in chaotic levels of carnage that reminded me more of a run-and-gun Call of Duty campaign than a slow-paced horror game.   Studying your surroundings for the telltale glint of a valuable gem that can be dislodged with a bullet, or keeping an ear out for the creak of an item-carrying birdcage that can be knocked down aren’t the only ways to uncover rewards for backtracking and exploring off the beaten path. Animals like fish and pigs can be killed, their meat turned into dishes by the Duke that give permanent boosts to Ethan’s health and defense. Actually tracking down some of the more exotic animals requires you to first find photographic clues to their specific locations, and while it’s not particularly challenging to take them down once you’ve found them, I took some dark delight in slashing at a yard full of chickens with Ethan’s pocket knife (it’s the closest I’ve ever come to actually playing a Legend of Zelda game in first-person).  Elsewhere, there are countless invaluable story morsels tucked away that provide a clearer picture of ties between the village’s inhabitants and the Umbrella Corporation, as well as mini boss fight encounters that in some instances managed to completely blindside me. One of my favourite face-offs in Village is entirely optional: a close-quarters battle against a towering axe-wielding ogre that I only stumbled onto because I accidentally took a wrong turn on the way to my next story objective.  However, my trip through Resident Evil Village wasn’t entirely without its missteps. I’m not sure Capcom was prepared for how much of a phenomenon Lady Dimitrescu would become with the Resident Evil fanbase, because despite the horniest hopes of internet perverts her appearance is certainly intimidatingly long-legged, but also disappointingly short-lived. She arrives very early on, is reasonably easy to avoid as far as stalker enemies go, and isn’t as big a presence as you might expect from Village’s billboard-sized poster girl. dir=""ltr""     It’s worth highlighting that on Standard difficulty, which is the setting I chose for my initial playthrough of the story, Resident Evil Village felt like significantly less of a challenge than Resident Evil 7 was, overall. Despite no shortage of near-death moments, I actually only perished in Village a total of three times over the course of the campaign. I’ve since restarted Village on Hardcore mode, where enemy movement speed is much faster, a greater scarcity of ammo demands smarter use of environmental hazards like the exploding barrels, and the general sense of desperation is more pronounced. If you’re a veteran of the series, I’d suggest you at least start out on Hardcore and see how you go – you can after all drop it down to Standard if the more fierce level of Lycans isn’t to your, well, liking.  Once Village’s story has been finished, points earned from completing certain objectives in the campaign can be spent to obtain infinite-ammo weapons for subsequent playthroughs, various pieces of concept art, and more – but for me, the most valuable bonus to unlock is fortunately also the cheapest; the Mercenaries mode. This time-attack arcade mode (which debuted in Resident Evil 3) returns with a few new gameplay tweaks and serves up some high-speed survival-horror shooting against waves of wolfmen that’s only a few distorted guitar riffs away from actually passing as a Doom arena. dir=""ltr""  It’s admittedly slightly annoying that I have to rebind the shortcuts to my favourite weapons at the start of every run, and the fact that you need an at least an A rating on each stage before you unlock the next makes for a slightly inflexible first impression, but otherwise I’m finding this revival of Resident Evil’s long-dormant Mercenaries mode to be an addictive bonus that I’ve already spent several hours with as I continue to chase those elusive S and SS rankings and their resulting special weapon unlocks. Roaming the streets of Resident Evil Village is like visiting a disturbing and deadly Disneyland, where every attraction is a house of horrors. I got just as big a thrill out of revelling in its frenzied violence as I did retracing my steps through the gradually revealed recesses of its sizable village setting to uncover the darkest story secrets of its monstrous main cast. Boss fights are a bit of a letdown but the great variety of enemies throughout keeps things tense, especially on Hardcore mode. The fact that it's very much a throwback to the fast-paced action of Resident Evil 4 also means it largely takes a step back from the slow-burn scares of Resident Evil 7's excellent opening hours, which may well disappoint those who prefer more psychological dread to blowing off heads. But if you have an itch for action-heavy survival-horror, then Resident Evil Village will scratch it like a fistfull of Lady Dimitrescu’s freakish fingernails. "
251,urnal ,8.0,"Fast and frantic action, a dazzling display of thousands of bullets in a multitude of shapes and sizes, and glorious, glorious particle effects. These hallmarks are what Housemarque games are all about, and Returnal certainly checks all of those boxes. But it’s also their most ambitious effort yet: a PS5-exclusive third-person shooter with an incredible sense of exploration and discovery, rich atmosphere on par with Dead Space or Metroid Prime, and shootouts that remain fresh and rewarding throughout the multiple playthroughs needed to beat its roguelike campaign and unlock the secrets that remain beyond the credits. A good run takes a bit too long for something you have to complete in one sitting, but the reward for making that commitment is more than worthwhile. Returnal tells the story of Selene Vassos after she crash-lands on an alien planet called Atropos. As she emerges from her ship and tries to locate the origin of a mysterious signal, things start to get very weird and time-loopy very quickly. Of course, this all serves to contextualize the fact that this is a roguelike and built on the idea of repeated runs through the same environments, but it’s also a clever storytelling device. Selene is able to find logs left by her former selves, which slowly starts to peel back the layers of Returnal’s central questions. Housemarque even goes a step further by incorporating a number of surreal and chilling PT-esque first-person segments where Selene must explore her memories and nightmares.   It makes Selene an interesting protagonist who’s in this weird repeating-but-different scenario along with us, and it’s all way deeper than I would ever expect a roguelike’s story to be. Housemarque deserves praise for finding a unique and compelling way to incorporate an interesting story in a genre that makes storytelling rather difficult. It’s not quite as elegant of a solution as Hades’ home base full of characters that always have something new to say to you based on your successes, failures, and overall progress, but it’s an admirable effort nonetheless.  Learning those behaviors is important, because Returnal really, really encourages you to avoid getting hit. There’s an adrenaline meter that builds up as you score kills and grants up to five stacking buffs, but they all disappear when you take a single hit. Also, if you pick up health items while you’re at max life it actually adds to your total health capacity. Returnal is a hard game, but it rewards you handsomely for playing well and for making smart choices, which is always a great feeling. Sometimes the risk pays off, like when I open a malignant chest and receive a powerful weapon that’s two levels higher than the one I currently have and helps me decimate the next few rooms of a level. But oftentimes it doesn’t, and I just get a weak consumable and an added two seconds of cooldown to my dash. Coming out on the bad end of a risk-vs-reward gamble can be brutal, but it also is one of the things that makes each run of Returnal feel unique and exciting. You just have to make the best of a bad situation, which is one of the key aspects of the roguelike genre that Returnal absolutely nails. This improvisational style of combat that has you constantly changing up your weapons, altering your strategy on the fly based upon the types of upgrades that you come across, and deciding whether to buy or save your currency is crucial to making every run feel like a new and fresh experience. The roguelike format also works because of how interesting each of the 10 weapons are. While most fill the expected roles in a shooter, several others are wildly inventive. There’s a gun that never has to reload but can only be fired once a round bounces back into the gun, and a weapon that fires pylons into the ground and triggers streams of red lightning between them. It’s clever stuff.  Returnal’s persistent progression comes from the fact that these traits are already present on guns that you find when you start, but they must be unlocked by scoring enough kills with that weapon. After you’ve done that once, any weapon you find in a future playthrough with that trait has it automatically unlocked (and upgraded, once you’ve unlocked those). This adds another element to the risk-reward equation: sometimes you’ll have to decide whether you want to keep a weapon with great traits that’s helpful in the moment, versus tossing it in favor of a new weapon with a promising new trait that needs to be unlocked. That can definitely be worth the sacrifice in the long run. However, one of the key aspects of the roguelike genre that Returnal does not nail is that nagging feeling of “just one more run.” That’s because a run through Returnal lasts way too long, plain and simple. To paint a picture, I’ve put in 42 hours into Returnal so far, and in those 42 hours I’ve only died 25 times. That’s not a weird flex, or me saying that this game is easy, because again, it’s absolutely not. It’s to illustrate that if you’re going to get anywhere near the end your run is almost always going to be at least about two hours long, which is exhausting. It also means you have to clear your schedule when you sit down to play, because there’s no saving your progress at any point in the run. Until you’re done with that run you cannot play any other game, you cannot fully turn the PS5 off (only put it in rest mode, which is risky in of itself), or do anything else that closes the application. And obviously, you’d better hope that it doesn’t crash – that happened to me on two separate occasions and halted two runs where I was more than an hour deep. Runs last so long because of the fact that there is very little in the way of permanent progression outside of traits, and because of the way temporary progression on individual runs is handled. For instance, weapons don’t drop based on how deep into a level you are; instead, you build up a Weapon Proficiency meter by killing enemies and finding items that add to the meter. So, for example, if my weapon proficiency meter is at 5, weapons will drop with a power level of 5 or, with luck, slightly higher. Attempting a later level when your weapon proficiency is at too low a level takes an already hard game and makes it absolutely ridiculously difficult. So, if you want to make a real attempt at succeeding in Returnal, you have to grind. The good news at least, is that the actual act of exploration in Returnal is done extraordinarily well. Every level is a sight to behold, whether it’s the dark, gloomy, and alien vibe of the Overgrown Ruins; the Doom-esque feel of the Crimson Wastes; or the ancient mechanical atmosphere of the Derelict Citadel. It helps, too, that there’s a great variety in the challenges of the many rooms. Despite the procedural generation that keeps Returnal from becoming too predictable, enemies and environmental elements always feel deliberately placed – especially the grapple points that allow you to put distance between you and especially dangerous foes, deadly pits that punish careless movement, and loads of secrets lying in wait. While Returnal is not a PS5 graphical showcase on the level of say, Demon’s Souls, it still looks really good and runs at a mostly consistent 60fps, though it does dip every now and then ever so slightly in certain spots. Where Returnal does show its “new-gen” chops is in the ways it uses the DualSense controller. Barring Astro’s Playroom, this is the best usage of haptic feedback and adaptive triggers so far on the platform because it actually makes a difference in how you play. Sure, it’s cool to be able to feel rain drops on the controller, but what’s even cooler is having that added element of sensory feedback to let you know when your alt-fire is off cooldown in the form of a very specific feeling rumble in your controller. And while it takes a little bit of getting used to, I grew to love being able to aim down sight (ADS) by holding the left trigger halfway, and then pressing it all the way down to quickly go into an alternate fire. The triggers gave me just the right amount of resistance to the point where I never mistakenly pressed the trigger all the way down when I meant to ADS or vice-versa. And hey, if you don’t love it, there’s a classic control scheme that just keeps ADS on L2 and maps alt-fire to the R1 button, or you could just map the controls however you like. There are also daily challenges which give you an opportunity to compete against other players for a high score under set conditions, which is a neat diversion and feels particularly fitting as a score-chasing arcade-style mode in a Housemarque game. As I mentioned earlier, I’ve played Returnal for about 42 hours, but I actually rolled credits at around hour 18. Everything since then has been working toward uncovering a secret ending, finding all of the 80 xenocyphers hidden throughout the six levels, and trying to find as many lore-dropping audio logs as I can. Needless to say, there’s a lot of meat on this bone, and completionists will find plenty to keep them busy for quite a while. The moment-to-moment gameplay of Returnal is sublime, with a great selection of weapons that each have a wide variety of interesting possible traits, meaningful strategic decisions that can either keep a run afloat or doom it to sink, and punishingly challenging yet rewarding gunplay that is consistently exhilarating. Even with all of this focus on action, it never drops the ball on the story. Its big issue is that runs last way too long, and there’s no way to save progress outside of putting the PS5 in rest mode. That saps the desire to immediately return and try again after a failure, though not enough to grind it to a halt. Even so, Returnal is an incredible roguelike, and one of Housemarque’s best games to date "
252,New Pokémon Snap ,8.0,"It's a good thing no one had a camera on me during my first playthrough of New Pokémon Snap, because I probably looked and sounded like a total dingus. Without fail, each time I played a new course a Pokémon would appear out of nowhere, or do something cute, or react to something I did in a surprising way, and I (this is not an exaggeration) would sit up on the couch, point at the screen, and go ""Aaah!"" in delight. I love the way The Pokémon Company has, in recent years, begun letting more companies outside Game Freak (think Niantic with Pokémon Go, or Legendary Pictures with Detective Pikachu) make media that shows off Pokémon not as collectibles or as static RPG party members but as lovable, intelligent creatures. After successfully digging into their combat prowess in Pokken Tournament, Bandai Namco has been handed the far more peaceful reigns of an on-rails nature photography game and charged with portraying Pokémon as wild creatures in living ecosystems to be observed, befriended, and only ""captured"" via camera. Given the timbre of my happy yells every time a Wooper said ""Woooh!"" at me, if my neighbors had known what I was doing they'd probably agree that New Pokémon Snap is a delightful success on this front.   Despite its flaws, I was a big fan of the original Pokémon Snap on Nintendo 64 back in 1999. The classic on-rails photography game had a very fun premise, sending you on a nature safari to try and get the best photos possible of Pokémon living and interacting in their natural habitats. Though the idea was sound and many of Pokémon Snap's best moments are still memorable to this day (the Jigglypuff concert! Charizard popping out of the lava pool! Surfing Pikachu!), it was painfully short, with only just over 60 Pokémon available across seven courses that were precisely the same every single time. Even with the meat of trying to solve a few puzzles to line up some rarer shots, 1999's Pokémon Snap inevitably left me wishing for so much more.   New Pokémon Snap also has far more story to drive it along, with a Pokémon professor named Mirror and his crew of research assistants trying to solve yet another Pokémon mystery, though overall it’s a fairly forgettable progression tool. You'll visit a sparkling beach, a dense jungle, a desert, underwater caverns, and several more locations, all of which look better than I've seen any Pokémon game look yet – beauty which comes at the cost of some occasional frustrating framerate dips when it pushes the Switch beyond its comfort zone. These are most noticeable in one stage in particular, when an absolutely massive Wailord slowly breaches the ocean surface and briefly slows everything to a crawl.     Most of the Pokémon manage to look very good without melting your Switch in your hands though, and for the most part will react in interesting ways to just about anything you (literally or figuratively) throw at them, be it fruit, glowing Illumina Orbs, or a catchy tune. It's easy to view being on-rails as a limitation, but in New Pokémon Snap it's apparent that keeping your own interactions with the world a bit more limited than in something like a typical Pokémon RPG has freed Bandai Namco up to make the many different things the Pokémon themselves do far more varied, detailed, and enjoyable to watch. iframe allowautoplay="""" allowfullscreen=""true"" class=""gallery gallery embeddedgallery"" data-src=""/gallery/44804/embed"" height=""453"">New Pokémon Snap gracefully avoids Pokémon Snap's problem of repeating the exact same courses ad infinitum in several ways. Most courses get both day and night versions, with each variation including more than enough distinct Pokémon and interactions to merit the duplication. Many courses also hide branching pathways, some obvious and some hidden, that let you get better views on certain monsters or discover new ones entirely.  But after repeated visits to the park and numerous well-scored photos, trust is earned and your Research Level increases. Eventually, rather than scurry off any time you appear, Grookey and Pichu will greet you the moment they see you, waiting around and cheering at you long enough for you to snap adorable photos of the pair at a more leisurely pace. They'll chase you playfully through the level, introduce you to their buddy Scorbunny, and pose repeatedly so you can get a really good shot for your Photodex. Somewhat frequently, I would discover what I believed to be an amazing, exciting interaction in a level and managed to get a photo I was proud of, only to find that jerk Professor Mirror didn't recognize what I'd snapped as anything different than the Pokémon's everyday, default activity. Meanwhile, I have multiple Pokémon PhotoDex pages filled with photos that, to my eye, are almost indistinguishable, yet they all have different star ratings. It's ultimately not a massive issue, as I can still save any cool shots I get to my album and show off my discoveries, but Mirror's lack of recognition and unclear standards often deflated my excitement a bit at finding something I thought was rare. The Re-Snap feature in particular is a great addition that lets you go back and adjust a shot in the moment, in case you were just a little bit off or out of focus. It's not a perfect do-over button (which is probably for the best), but rather a way to make small adjustments to the second a photo was taken so you're not left frustrated that something wasn't just so. Also, while the online features were only just enabled yesterday, their mere existence is an essential function and I'm already enjoying some of the cool snaps my fellow reviewers have shared while decking out my own profile with my favorites. Fun as these are, the most memorable bits of New Pokémon Snap lie squarely in its photo-taking core. This is especially true of the best moments with Pokémon who do not often get the spotlight in other games, like the Bouffalant I saw wearing a flower crown, or the horrifying time Pinsir's teeth stuck out of its mouth, or when I learned exactly how a Stunfisk eats a piece of fruit. Even right now as I'm writing this, I'm puzzling in my head over how to interact with a particular area in one of the later stages that surely, surely must hide some very cool moment, if I could only tease out the right combination of fruit and orbs and music and Pokémon and timing to find it. Having told myself when I started that I wouldn't try too hard to fill my entire PhotoDex if it didn't happen orgaasfnidascally, New Pokémon Snap has me feeling a bit like a kid again – eager to catch 'em all. After a 22-year gap, New Pokémon Snap is a successful modern reinvention of all the best ideas of Pokémon Snap, with more courses, more Pokémon, and more reasons to revisit familiar spots in pursuit of the perfect shot. Some of its supportive systems, like its photo scoring and tutorials, can drag down momentum or even frustrate at times. But at the end of the day, some artificial grade is utterly secondary to the clever environmental storytelling you’ll experience as you level up courses, the fun of discovering surprising photo opps, and the sheer joy of observing a moving ecosystem of believable, personable, and lovable Pokémon. b>New Pokémon Snap Nintendo Switch "
253,MotoGP 21 ,7.0,"We haven’t regularly covered the MotoGP series in the past but the motorcycle specialists at developer Milestone have been quietly iterating on it for over 15 years. With all that experience, it should probably come as no surprise that the latest edition, MotoGP 21, is a deep, satisfying, and sometimes unflinchingly tough modern motorsport simulation. It’s packaged fairly similarly to Codemasters’ F1 series and KT Racing’s WRC games, only with 50% fewer wheels and 500% more terrifying crashes. Of course, if you’ve been keeping close track of its progress you’ll find that MotoGP 21 is a lot like MotoGP 20 – identical even, in some areas – although there have been a couple of welcome tweaks that do genuinely improve the bike handling and the racing.  MotoGP 21’s sensation of speed is quite remarkable, especially in first-person, and the feeling of weight is also excellent. On track the racing is aggressive and dangerous: relative to last year’s game, changes to the suspension system means the bikes feel more alive over bumps, and particularly under heavy braking. Milestone has also added brake temperature management, which augments the racing with yet another layer of strategy to wrestle with. Brakes that are too cold or too hot, for instance, won’t be as effective, and I definitely noticed when the bike wasn’t pulling up as quickly. MotoGP 21 is an extremely demanding racer, though, and the degree of difficulty increases exponentially the more you lower the riding aids, which offer assists like throttle and braking input modulation and a cornering assist that irons out frantic left stick inputs – basically an invisible guiding hand to help the bike dip left and right more smoothly. Even with those crutches, however – and even against relatively sedate levels of AI competition – MotoGP 21 requires a high level of finesse to succeed. As a result, pulling off a win or placing well after a great fight on track is a rather rewarding experience. For racing fans yet to try Milestone’s series, MotoGP 21 turns out to be a good year to jump in thanks to a new tutorial mode that adds an extremely useful launchpad for getting accustomed to MotoGP’s tricky brand of bike racing. MotoGP 20 never took time to educate you on how to ride or even how to use your bike’s systems, but this year’s instalment rectifies that with a simple series of playable lessons outlining everything from straightforward bike control, to fuel management, and to electronic systems like engine brake, anti-wheelie, and traction control – all of which can be adjusted on track, on the fly. As such, despite its otherwise steep difficulty curve, MotoGP 21 is probably the most beginner-friendly MotoGP game in years, and I think the effort to make it slightly less impenetrable for newbies is a very good move. Of course, if you’re a complete purist, rewinds and all other assists can be reduced or toggled off to force you to suffer the full consequences of coming off your bike so that you can experience one of the most notable new additions this year: a full, manual bike-retrieval sequence. That is, after coming off you won’t automatically respawn on your bike; you’ll need to jog over to wherever the bike came to a stop, lift it up, and hop back on. I actually really like how this looks in-game – and it’s certainly a cool, authentic little sequence to layer into the racing – but the fact that manual bike retrieval is only applicable to humans and not the AI means it’s enormously and fundamentally flawed. How is it fair that the AI racers still respawn on their bikes instantly, speeding away while I was still hoofing it back to my own bike? It’ll be neat if this is fixed in an update, but in its current form the function is pointless to use. MotoGP 21 also introduces the real-world series’ Long Lap Penalty, a narrow and specifically longer route placed somewhere on each track that serves to punish riders for track limit violations and false starts. Long Lap Penalty zones have been added to every track from the 2021 championship and definitely bolster MotoGP 21’s feeling of authenticity, though I’d stress I’ve never seen the AI have to take one yet. Finally, while MotoGP 21 is filled with character faces only a mother could love, there’s some pretty great detail to be spotted elsewhere, from the mistreated rubber of a cooked tyre to the gleam of wet asphalt. Off-track, however, the recycled vignettes and same-same menus make things feel a bit stale, generally. It’s also peculiar that female riders are still being referred to as blokes – that just feels half-baked. A new tutorial system makes MotoGP 21 a good year for new riders to jump aboard this long-running motorcycle racing sim, though its other additions are slim enough that returning players will probably feel let down. One of the biggest new features, making you retrieve your bike after a spill, won’t be a good idea until the AI has to do it as well, but the tweaks to the bike handling are notable improvements to what is still most certainly the best-feeling MotoGP game to date. "
254,NieR Replicant Ver. 1.22474487139 ,8.0, I missed out on Nier when it first arrived in 2010, so my experience going into Nier Replicant Ver. 1.22474487139 was a fresh one. I find myself rather thankful for that because if there’s one thing you need to know going into this new version of creative director Yoko Taro’s bold, genre-bending action-RPG, it’s that you can expect to revisit the same places, fighting the same enemies, and pushing the same godforsaken boxes around a lot. It’s one of the bigger issues with Nier, but the important thing to note is that the ways in which Nier Replicant disappoints are mostly forgivable when you consider the ways in which it astounds: Surprises await around every corner, characters are unforgettable, and the emotional story will resonate in my mind for a long, long time. Ver. 1.22 (for the sake of my own sanity, I’m just going to round down from here on out) is in a strange place of being more than just a remaster, but also less than a remake. It obviously looks much better when compared to the muddy original, with dramatically improved draw distances, cleaner textures, better character models, and a consistently smooth 60fps framerate. At the same time, though, it still gives off that PS3/360-era RPG vibe: environments lack detail, NPCs are stiff and just kind of stare lifelessly into the void, the world is broken up into small chunks with loading screens bridging the gaps, and there are no current-gen console enhancements for the PS5 or Xbox Series X. It certainly isn’t an ugly game anymore by any standard, but it also still feels a step behind 2017’s Nier Automata. However, one big change, and one of the reasons why I think it’s impossible to label this just as a remaster, is the fact that every character is now voiced. This is a huge improvement that goes a long way in bringing Nier’s otherwise-sleepy world to life. Beyond the visuals and voice acting, Nier’s combat also has seen some love, smoothing out its animations and making it feel extremely comparable to Nier Automata’s. One of the big things that was taken from Automata is the seamless integration of weapon combat with your skills. So where in the original you had to sit still while you charge a spell like Dark Lance, now you can pretty freely move around and charge any spell, as well as cast them while attacking. That all makes combat behave much more like a traditional action game and goes a long way in improving the actual feel of Nier’s combat.  On the plus side, there are three different weapon classes with pretty distinct fighting styles and move lists. There’s a caveat to enjoying all of them, though, in that upgrading the weapons within those classes is very expensive and requires a lot of grinding. Unless you want to spend even more hours in the Junk Heap farming robots, you’re encouraged to pick one and stick with it. There’s also a small element of playstyle customization in the form of upgrades called words that you collect as you level up and defeat enemies. These words can be added to weapons, spells, and your defensive techniques to add special properties to them, such as added strength, guard break, magic power, and so on. While being able to tailor your character by swapping words in and out is a welcome feature, I never felt any sort of need to customize my weapons or abilities in any sort of way other than just equipping whatever words that gave me the most damage on whatever I had equipped, because the combat scenarios never challenged me in any ways that required me become more specialized. What saves it from becoming outright dull are the ways in which Nier Replicant throws you into its combat encounters, which vary wildly. It masterfully plays with camera angles and perspective shifts in some truly inspired ways, and those do a great job of alleviating at least some of that feeling of repetition.  Nier’s story starts slow, but ultimately becomes the absolute best part. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic fantasy world in which a teenager named Nier (or whatever you choose to name him) sets out to find a cure for his sister, Yonah, who’s afflicted with a terminal illness. It’s a deeply personal story; one about a brother’s love for his sister much more so than any sort of grander ambitions to save the world, which is one of the more intriguing aspects about it as an RPG. Nier and his companions are not “chosen heroes of light” or anything of the sort, and the actions that they take very often fall into a morally gray territory – and sometimes they push the needle somewhere even darker. It’s a credit to the strength of Nier Replicant’s writing and the performances of its cast that, regardless of how dark or grim things get, its characters are always a joy to be around. The snooty sentient floating book Grimoire Weiss is endlessly entertaining with his condescending commentary on whatever’s happening; the scantily clad and foul-mouthed Kainé is just an absolute badass and is hilarious in her vulgarity; and Emil is just the purest and most kindhearted floating skeleton with a creepy head you’ll ever see. I’d be remiss to leave out the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack. Like Nier Automata’s, it’s composed by Keiichi Okabe and features the soothing vocals of Emi Evans, and it’s just an absolute joy to listen to. Whether it’s the catchy and relaxing overworld theme that plays as you’re running through the northern plains or the grand operatic music that hits when you face off against a boss, it’s all phenomenal. And as an added bonus for version 1.22, you can even switch the soundtrack to Nier Automata’s if you so desire.  But like most RPGs, Nier Replicant is made up of both main quests and side quests, and while the main quest is fantastic (well, at least eventually… again, it starts very slow), the side quests are terrible. They’re utterly mundane, with the vast majority of them turning you into an errand boy as you bounce back and forth between locations collecting ingredients, delivering items, or finding sparklies on the ground. It’s made even worse by the fact that there’s no way to set a side quest as your active quest, which means that there are no waypoints on the map or minimap to guide you to your next destination. This is an area that absolutely feels like it should have been addressed as a quality of life improvement for Ver. 1.22, but no dice. The fact that they are super unrewarding and not worth the effort actually ends up being a net positive because it means you can ignore them and go pretty much the entire game without ever letting them distract you from the main questline.  One of the boldest decisions with regards to Nier Replicant is the fact that, as Yoko Taro games tend to, it demands to be played more than once. If you just did one playthrough from start to credits, you’d be missing out on literally half the story. This may sound like a drag, and to an extent it kind of is, but that’s necessary to tell a story in a way that could only be told through video games – and it’s a sacrifice that’s worth making. Besides, it’s not as bad as it sounds, because after you beat the campaign once, you’re able to load your save back up and replay from the beginning of the second act. So you’re not actually playing through the whole thing again, just the latter (and better) half of it. The second playthrough of Nier Replicant is actually the best one, because even though you get all the same events as the first playthrough, albeit with a few new scenes and crucially important bits of additional dialogue, you’re going through those same events with the knowledge of what happens at the end. That which totally recontextualizes everything the entire second half and leads to some truly incredible story moments that hit me harder emotionally than a video game has in some time. The third playthrough, which you must do in order to see the final three endings, is where things get a little out of hand. It’s nearly identical to the second one, and you must also find all of the weapons before you challenge the final boss. Thankfully, the sidequests that are tied to the weapons are much better than the standard sidequests, but it’s still a frustratingly grindy requirement just to see the true conclusion of the story. And yes, for the hardcore fans wondering if there’s a new ending added to Ver. 1.22, without going into spoilers let me just say that yes, there is one – and it is truly special. As a “Version Up” of the original Nier, Replicant Ver. 1.22 does a respectable job of updating the graphics and combat of the 2010 cult classic to a more modern standard by dramatically improving its environments, animations, and performance, while also going the extra mile and adding excellent voice acting to every single character in its world. It definitely shows its age in its combat and quest design, however, and while the improvements to combat certainly help smooth things out it still suffers from repetitive enemies, mundane sidequests, and a lack of evolution over the course of the 35 to 40-hour adventure you’ll need to complete to see all the endings. Just push through it and get to what’s truly excellent about Nier Replicant: its story and characters, both of which are still among the strongest I’ve seen in the genre. "
Now that I’ve had time to fully blast my way through Outriders, it’s time for our final review – we appreciate your patience! Now, People Can Fly’s gritty, blood-and-guts take on the co-op looter-shooter RPG genre definitely delivers great action that’s kicked up a notch by impressive sci-fi super powers, some cool world design, and a pretty satisfying loot grind. At the same time, an occasionally clunky interface, some persistent bugs, and a messy story make it seem less like a big-budget science-fiction epic and more like a guilty pleasure Sy-Fy Channel™ original series. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, of course - sure, SyFy might be responsible for Defiance and Hunters, but it also gave us modern classics like Battlestar Galactica and... The Expanse is pretty good, too! (It had to be saved from cancelation by Amazon Prime Video, but that’s beside the point!) Outriders would definitely fall somewhere in between those extremes if it were a TV show – its story makes decent use of its recognizable sci-fi tropes for when deep-space colonization goes wrong, but the script often takes its grim/dark self too seriously. A lot of the voice acting falls flat – particularly for the leads, who mostly just dutifully grunt their way through accepting quests – and the script careens back and forth between being so hardboiled that it borders on camp, to downright cringeworthy takes on the ugliness of humankind. While there are a few moments throughout that could have evoked some believable empathy, they’re all undermined as a result. That said, the overarching story and unexpectedly hostile alien world is interesting enough to keep things moving, and there are some genuinely intriguing twists as it progresses, even if (without getting into spoiler territory) their payoffs are somewhat underwhelming. Outriders is at its best when you’re blasting your way through hordes of bad guys with a couple of friends. Gunfights are frenzied affairs that leave battlefields literally coated with blood, and even though you’ll likely outgrow its cover mechanics pretty quickly as you progress, this delightfully chaotic action is just as entertaining at the third level as it is at the thirtieth. Sure, the combat scenarios become fairly repetitive – especially after you’ve played more than a few of Outriders’ endgame challenge missions that follow its 30-odd-hour campaign. But the combination of sadistically gratifying superpowers and destructive weaponry makes sure it’s always good fun – there’s something morbidly hilarious about seeing a whole-ass ribcage rolling through a skirmish like a bony tumbleweed – and that borderline cartoonish, over-the-top violence is really accentuated in multiplayer. Each of the four classes has strengths, weaknesses, and skill sets familiar to class-based action games – except for the fact that here they’re all primarily focused on dealing damage (of the 32 unlockable class skills in Outriders, only two have healing abilities). Still, each compliments the others in more interesting ways than something like the standard healer would. I genuinely can’t remember the last game that could make me cackle as hard as when my earth-bending Devastator combos a Gravity Leap with a Trickster’s Stasis Bubble, creating a slow-motion fountain of bad guy chunks. That uniform focus on damage output may be a turn-off for anybody who really loves to play a capital-S Support class, but the fact that any class can competently reduce the opposition to a sticky red paste allows everybody to safely go it alone if they want. However, I will reiterate that it is far more enjoyable to gun down hordes of monsters and space bandits with friends. The human enemies you’ll face are fairly limited, ranging from run-of-the-mill rifleman to rushing berserkers and the occasional superpowered minibosses (that get decidedly more powerful towards the endgame), but they provide enough tactical variety to demand some quick thinking and strategy. Of course, we’re not alone: As you explore more of the planet’s interesting and diverse wilderness, Outriders trots out some really cool monsters and environments, with interesting takes on snowy mountains, dense jungles, and beyond. The second half of the campaign is a bit too focused on desert landscapes, but the creature designs there are some of Outriders’ best. From the variations on fodder-level mutants to the larger beasts that look like somehow even grosser and meaner takes on something out of Half-Life or Alien, the encounters designed around them are a fun alternative to the endless rain of bullets you have to dance through when fighting human enemies. What’s unfortunate is that, despite good encounter design for both styles of enemies, the more traditional boss battles are some of the least engaging fights Outriders has to offer. Sure, that five-story-tall Street Shark monster looks awesome, but the whole “shoot the big thing outside the arena and avoid being smashed by its big hand” concept feels a little played out. Similarly, while some of the endgame missions do a fun job of tying up loose storylines, others just feel like harder reskins of earlier boss fights. The frantic action remains decently fun, but it’s rather anticlimactic to have jump into a higher-tier mission that boils down to “Fight this boss you hate for a third time, please,” especially after you’ve spent an additional 10 or 15 post-credits hours grinding up your gear level to reach them. When it comes to the stuff that falls out when you kill those guys – or that explodes in a blinding flash from a giant loot crate after an expedition – Outriders doesn’t exactly revolutionize the loot grind, but it at least offers some great looking options. Notable inclusions like the “double gun” – which is basically just two assault rifles welded together – or Legendary-tier weapons (most of which look like they’re carved out of some monster’s ribcage) give the otherwise mostly standard assortment of weapons some flavor. Not to mention what are easily my favorite video game autoshotguns since Doom, though they’re not so much “shotguns” as they are portable flak cannons – seriously, the novelty of just how loud and powerful these things are still hasn’t worn off after (at least) 50 hours. But the real good stuff comes as you find and build better gear, and here Outriders makes some smart adjustments to the traditional looter-shooter formula. Its World Tiers, which are Outriders’ 15 difficulty levels, are a good workaround for insurmountable challenge spikes that might discourage you in other co-op loot grinds, and its crafting options offer a wide range of character builds. A Note on Microtransactions Good news on this front - there aren’t any!
The development team at People Can Fly have been very adamant that Outriders is not a live-service game, and as such won’t feature microtransactions of any kind. “The bad things that are sometimes connected to games as a service, like loot boxes or any pay to win mechanics, we are against them,” says Creative Director Bartosz Kmita. “So we're not using them at all in our game.” The news may be that there is no news, but we thought it would be good to let you know that you don’t need to worry about seeing any content locked behind a paywall here. That said, for every smart twist there’s also a frustrating drawback. On the plus side, I really appreciate how the crafting system simplifies the process of modding your gear compared to other loot-heavy adventures, and the variety of easy to swap mods offers a lot of flexibility to adjust your build. Granted, the loot grind can be a bit frustrating if you’re trying to blitz your way through it, but the level of customization on hand as you progress is a tinkerer’s dream come true. Basic armor mods, for example, provide buffs to your active abilities. You might boost the damage of your Trickster’s Temporal Blade, or make it so your Devastator can turn two bad guys into shish kebabs at once. Higher level gear lets you add higher-tier mods to your library - rather than having to craft each mod individually – as well as gear with multiple slots. That allows you to do things like take a gun that explodes frozen enemies into icy shrapnel for AOE damage and add cryo rounds so that it freezes them and blows them up in one go, or pair a gun that regenerates your health on every kill with an armor mod that gives you bonus damage whenever you heal. What’s frustrating is that, because loot grinds are designed to encourage incremental progress, I was routinely changing up my gear loadout, meaning I constantly had to return to base camp to fiddle with my mod loadout. You can’t do that on the go, and the crafting UI is not great. Outriders is far from the only game to have this issue, but it’s still frustrating to constantly bounce back and forth between the crafting menu and your inventory screen for lack of a decent sort/compare function – especially when you have to talk to an NPC every single time you want to open the crafting menu. A similar problem exists for its “fast” travel system, where you have to return to a campsite to fast-travel back to your main campsite, to then talk to an NPC and fast-travel to a new quest hub. This can be especially irksome when you run into progress choke points, usually at the start of a new World Tier. Finding better gear requires playing on the highest available World Tier, and the catch is that you lose Tier XP (which is separate from your character level) every time you die. So, you have to either play tediously slowly if you’re constantly optimizing your build, or lower the World Tier at the cost of loot quality. This does eventually become less of an issue as you’re regularly getting Epic or better gear – for me it was around World Tier seven and eight – but, man, making that jump from Tier six to Tier seven took forever. It’s also less frustrating once you reach Outriders’ endgame, since all the necessary merchants end up in one place, though it’s replaced by having to constantly juggle resource and currency types by jumping between your inventory, then to a vendor, then to another vendor after that, and then back to your crafting station to upgrade your gear. And once you do reach the point in the endgame where semi-regular legendary drops occur, the cost to upgrade or improve your preferred gear is high enough to require its own grind for disposable loot. Thankfully I found a build that let me punch well above my weight class to grab better drops, but not everyone will be so lucky. Outriders also has its fair share of technical issues. These range from bizarre idiosyncrasies like jarring cutscenes for opening doors or poor balance between dialogue and background audio to some more troublesome persistent bugs. Enemies are often able to shoot through cover, abilities occasionally don’t work properly (I can’t tell you how many times my Trickster’s teleport ability flashed but then didn’t send me anywhere), I found a specific bug with my most powerful weapon mod that just disabled it if I had it equipped during cutscenes, and crashes are still semi-frequent when playing co-op. Those can be annoying, but they’re manageable enough that it didn’t detract too much from the overall fun of kerploding monsters and bad guys. I’m also glad to see that the most egregious issues seem to be behind us: servers are mostly stable and the bug that was wiping out people’s inventories (with the nasty chance of that being permanent if it occured along with a crash) has, as of this review, apparently been patched out (we haven’t experienced the inventory bug ourselves since just after launch). Outriders offers some genuinely great sci-fi action, alongside some really interesting world and creature design that I'd love to see more of. Its mostly satisfying take on RPG loot progression is well worth putting up with a lackluster story, a few clunky interfaces, and some lingering technical issues. Outriders is the good kind of grind - especially if you're into goo-ifying your enemies with a couple of friends. "
256,Oddworld: Soulstorm ,7.0, If you’ve never played an Oddworld game and seen how it all comes together, then you’ll probably be horrified to learn that practically all of Oddworld: Soulstorm is one giant escort quest. Not only that, but the followers you’re escorting don’t have the brains God promised a goat, are gruesomely killed by anything that so much as sneezes at them, and complain nearly constantly – and all of this has been done by the developers on purpose. The challenge of this unusual action-platformer is in keeping these hopelessly useless creatures alive through increasingly deadly levels via trial and many, many, many errors.   Oddworld: Soulstorm is a ground-up remake of 1998’s Oddworld: Abe’s Exoddus that reimagines the incredibly bizarre setting that is Oddworld. But the remake remains just as diabolically difficult as games of the PS1 era: each level finds a new way to imperil the lives of you and your followers in a devious test of your cleverness, creativity, and patience. One area might require you to sneak past armed guards who you’d have no hope of challenging in open combat, while another asks you to keep waves of enemies busy long enough for hundreds of your followers to run away.    The main tool you have at your disposal, though, is Abe’s awesome signature ability to possess enemies and use them as meat puppets against the enemy. You can make possessed enemies kill their friends, or help you solve a puzzle, or straight-up explode just to get them out of your way. That’s a really great way to give you an edge against the enormous odds that are stacked against you. Soulstorm is a bit stingy with how often you’re able to actually use your shamanistic powers, though, because the enemy places anti-chant devices all over the place that’ll give you a zap if you try to possess anything. Then again, it probably wouldn’t make for much of a challenge if they didn’t. The worst sections are when you’re forced to rely on your followers to assist in combat, which is often an unmitigated disaster. Your incompetent allies are incredibly inconsistent, even when told to stand in one spot and manually equipped with the best weapons for the job. Slow to react and completely clueless, your mudokon friends often let themselves get killed without putting up any kind of fight and might just stand there with a blank expression while they watch a slig with a shotgun massacre a dozen of their friends. These sections are without a doubt my least favorite because they seemed to rely on complete luck, which had me roaring at the screen.   In one instance, one of my followers refused to enter any portals and run towards freedom, meaning my otherwise-perfect run on a particularly challenging level was burned. In another, I wasn’t able to hear any dialogue during an end-of-level cutscene and had to replay the entire level to avoid missing the story. Sometimes certain enemies would just be immune to my attempts to damage them for no reason. The list goes on and on. Developer Oddworld Inhabitants is aware of many bugs and has already released a few updates to address some of these issues, but with so many bugs to squash it’s clear Soulstorm would have benefitted from a little more polish (as is the case with many games developed in the era of COVID-19). Of course, you could always just say “screw it” and push through each level without saving anyone, but doing so will inevitably lead to an early end to your adventure with a finale that’s completely depressing (and well-deserved, you selfish monster). There are four endings in total: the worst ending, the bad ending, the good ending, and the best ending. The worst and best endings are simply small variations on the bad and good endings respectively, the latter which can be seen by only the most dedicated players and the former which honors those who are impressively awful at keeping their companions alive. The differences between the good and bad endings, though, are very significant. By mastering each level and exploring every nook and cranny to rescue all of your enslaved brothers, you’re rewarded with two additional levels at the end of the campaign and an ending that’s worthy of your hard work and determination. It’s an incredible incentive to keep as many of your followers alive as possible, and pushed me to shoot for a flawless completion in every level.   One of the things that makes Soulstorm completely worth the absolute pain in the neck that its challenging levels and numerous bugs often are is its story. The mudokon rebels are loveable, pitiable goofs, the power-hungry glukkons are disgusting, opportunistic monsters, and the setting’s dystopian depiction of untethered capitalism and environmental destruction is unique, incredibly distinctive, and hilariously macabre. Everything about Soulstorm is so charming and otherworldly it’s easy to get drawn into Abe’s journey from clueless slave to unlikely revolutionist, and as soon as the credits rolled I found myself crossing my fingers for a (hopefully less buggy) remake of Munch’s Oddysee in the near future. Controls have also been reworked from past entries to be more responsive and, although it could still use some more work, the maneuverability you have in Soulstorm is the best the series has seen. There are definitely some areas needing improvement, like the hit-or-miss nature of your ability to mantle up ledges or swing from pole-to-pole during platforming sections, but it’s still night and day compared to the clunkiness of Oddworld: New N’ Tasty. In particular, the responsiveness of the double jump allows you to more precisely navigate obstacles and survive the trove of deadly traps that await you in any given area. The weapons inventory and crafting system is smartly designed and gives a huge incentive to explore every nook and cranny in search of tools that make the going easier. For example, you can craft rubber stick balls to instantly apprehend almost any enemy, but the resource cost required to do so is quite high. You can also craft sticky explosive grenades to blow open pathways to new areas and detonate enemies, or build a flamethrower which makes the going much easier in every level. The downside is that you have to start from zero materials at the beginning of each level, which can be a little frustrating after you just spent the past hour accumulating a full arsenal in the previous one, but it’s understandable because it controls the tools you have access to in every level to add some interesting challenges. For example, at the beginning of one level you might only have the supplies needed to craft smoke bombs, forcing you to use stealth alone to get through the area. Later on, when you gather more supplies and can craft different tools, your options for approaching the next areas opens up quite a bit.  Music is also scarce in Soulstorm, meaning most of the time you’re listening to machinery clinking around in the background or dog-like creatures called slogs barking constantly (or whining for their lives when they’re killed, which made my skin crawl). I was tempted to simply hit the mute button and spare me the unpleasantness, especially during long sessions. For a remake that improves upon so much that has defined it in the past, it’s disappointing that Soulstorm can be a real headache to listen to. Oddworld: Soulstorm is a fantastic modernized remake of one of those side-scrollers that we remember as great but the original doesn’t hold up. Although it can be an aggravating slog to get through its escort quest-heavy levels, it’s also a unique, delightfully bizarre, and utterly rewarding experience with a fantastic story and a lot of heart. Of course, it also has far too many bugs that force restarts to circumvent, and that can turn the frustration of a good challenge into the bad, controller-throwing kind, and the sound design is all over the place. "
257,Balan Wonderworld ,4.0, It’s sad to say, but I’ve gotten used to disappointment when it comes to spiritual successors of iconic games made by their original creators. For every return as impressive as Bloodstained, there seems to be a far less successful attempt like Mighty No. 9. So, I’m disappointed but not surprised to see that Balan Wonderworld, the latest 3D platformer from Sonic the Hedgehog co-creators Yuji Naka and Naoto Ohshima, is a fundamentally flawed shadow of its predecessors. Its character designs, cutscenes, and music are certainly charming, but charm alone isn’t enough to make this half-baked platformer any less boring to actually play. When you’re hopping around Balan Wonderworld’s simultaneously imaginative yet bland stages, it doesn’t necessarily feel like a total trainwreck. Some of its barebones obstacle courses can occasionally produce hints of what I might call fun, and it’s not much more than a total bore the rest of the time. But when you take Balan Wonderworld as a whole, it sinks lower than the rudimentary platforming that barely props it up. From its misguided one-button control scheme, to its haphazard transforming costume mechanic and the levels that use them, to the half-hearted Chao Garden-like hub world between them, it gets a lot wrong – and very little of what it gets right helps to balance the scales.  This is usually the part where I’d break down Balan Wonderworld’s story for you, but there’s not much to tell about the unexplained nonsense it calls a plot. You play as either a boy who goes from happily breakdancing to being super bummed out in record time, or a girl whose housemaids whisper about her behind her back for no apparent reason. Your choice means very little, though, because either way you are quickly abducted by a magical tophat man named Balan and dropped into a dream land full of weird birds and crystals or something? It’s unclear, but that’s all the setup you’ll get before it starts parading you through 12 different worlds (each with just two levels, a boss, and an extra level once you beat the story) that are each structured around another sad person, all of whom seem completely unrelated to anything that’s going on. I’ve enjoyed plenty of games with incomprehensible stories, but Balan Wonderworld’s inanity is particularly disappointing when its animated cutscenes are so well made. They’re full of life and energy, and can even tell a few genuinely entertaining bite-sized stories about each world’s subject. Cutscenes primarily play right before a boss to quickly introduce the person for that world and a problem they are facing – be it a boy trying to build a flying machine or a scuba diving girl whose dolphin friend maimed her and left her to die – but a second cutscene right after the boss then immediately resolves it (don’t worry, she and the dolphin are cool now). That pacing not only makes each character’s story feel disjointed from everything else, including your protagonist, it means the levels you play before meeting them are devoid of context. If the first cutscene had played at the start of the world, then maybe I would have connected with those characters as I played through their reference-filled levels, like a chess player’s world being littered with chess pieces. But by holding their whole story to the end, Balan Wonderworld becomes little more than a jumble of endearing but incoherent ideas. Regardless of its story, the festering rot at the heart of Balan Wonderworld is the inexplicable decision to make it a one-button game. Apart from using the joystick to move and the shoulder buttons to swap between ability-altering costumes, nearly every other button on the controller does the same thing. That concept is taken laughably too far by making them the same in the menus too, forcing you to scroll to specific “back” buttons rather than just being able to hit B/Circle, which would be hilarious if it weren’t so stupid. When you’re not wearing a costume (which is extremely rare), your lone button is a simple and underwhelming jump, but each of Balan Wonderworld’s more than 80 different outfits change that function to something else. A jack-o-lantern costume makes your sole action a punch attack, while a sheep suit lets you hover jump, and there are a needlessly large number of other options to stumble across. The idea of a one-button control scheme isn’t an inherently bad one, but Balan Wonderworld doesn’t provide a single good reason for why it restricts itself this way. What it does do, however, is provide innumerable examples for why it shouldn’t have – most critically, it prevents certain costumes from performing that most basic of platforming tasks: jump. Some suits work fine with one button, particularly the jumping-focused ones (who would have guessed?), but others range from perplexing to downright awful as a result. Things like a clown that can only jump by slowly charging up an annoyingly small explosion, or a flower that can stretch up a uselessly short distance. If a costume uses its button to attack then odds are you can’t jump at all while wearing it, while others might still let you jump but at the cost of making their ability activate only when you’re standing still – or worse, entirely at random. Why in Wonderworld is that the better option? Player control is sacrificed for unnecessary simplicity again and again: a robot costume can shoot lasers only if you don’t move at all while a mantis suit can throw blades but not make it up a one-foot ledge, and neither of them make the frequently ignorable enemies any less dull to fight. And then there’s the truly baffling Box Fox, which Balan Wonderworld’s own tooltip explains will turn you into a plain cube “when it feels like it.” That’s genuinely unbelievable when the alternative would have just been to enable even a single extra button, and can make already bland costume abilities annoying or flatout unusable. And while you can carry three costumes at once and simply run around in a more maneuverable one most of the time, swapping between them is accompanied by an aggravatingly slow animation that makes doing so in a pinch a frantic affair. Because getting hit means you lose that costume entirely, I even found myself in a few situations where taking damage sometimes meant not having the one ability I needed to progress, or potentially not being able to jump at all. That leaves you with no option but to tediously backtrack and grab another copy of the outfit you need. Costumes are contained in purple gems that require a key to unlock, but that’s yet another mechanic that’s so pointless it’s silly. Keys are almost always just a few steps away from the gems themselves, occasionally tucked around a nearby corner or behind a box to provide all the challenge and excitement of playing hide and seek with a four-year-old. Collecting them is always just added friction in a game full of it. The visual variety of costumes is, at least, decently impressive, with a particular favorite of mine being a giant rolling BB-8 style panda. But mechanically, there’s an immense amount of overlap that can cause new obstacles to be monotonously similar to old ones – there are a half dozen different ways to hover in the air, multiple fighters that fill the same role, and countless options to destroy breakable blocks. While “over 80 different costumes!” might be a catchy bullet point for the back of its $60 box, the reality is Balan Wonderworld would have been a significantly better platformer if it only had 10 that it actually took proper advantage of. As is, each world has about five costumes it introduces, makes use of for some extremely basic platforming, and then throws away just as fast. Balan Wonderworld’s levels are mostly linear, but they ignore all the platforming fundamentals of introducing the basics of a mechanic and then building more interesting or challenging sections on top of it as you progress. Each stage seems like a mock-up of how a costume could be used in some better thought-out game we don’t get to play. Maybe the most glaring example of this is a costume that lets you summon a ladder on specific ladder spots (exciting, right?). It’s used to very simply get over some walls right after you get it and then basically never again, so why does it exist at all? Not all of them are quite that dry, with mildly more entertaining suits sending you bouncing between balloons or floating along air currents. But they never evolve past the lack of complexity found in the first few levels, leaving me bored and unengaged for the roughly nine hours it took to reach the credits. Most levels have small extra bits that can only be accessed with specific costumes from other worlds too, like a recurring bandstand platform that needs a musical costume to trigger – but that means “solving” these obstacles is purely a matter of having the right costume or not. If you spot blue webbing on a wall, you can go back to the closest checkpoint and swap into the spider costume to climb it (if you have an extra of that suit, otherwise you’ve got to go back to its home world first). But that’s not an interesting challenge, a fun discovery, or even a very well rewarded task as it’s very frequently just hiding some borderline useless crystals rather than the Statues that act as Balan Wonderworld’s Super Star equivalent to unlock more worlds. Those collectibles (and a hat with eyes) aren’t where the similarities to Super Mario Odyssey stop either. Balan Wonderworld clearly seems to take some inspiration from Mario’s latest major outing, but it doesn’t recapture any of the magic that made it so special. Mario’s capture forms are similarly limited in their capabilities, sure, but the vast majority of Odyssey is spent as Mario himself, whose controls are far more nuanced than a single jump button. Each level of that game is designed around Mario and his available captures with explicit intent, ramping up simple concepts into more complex ideas as you go. In contrast, Balan Wonderworld just throws a bunch of random ideas and costumes at you, let’s you swap to any of them any time you like, and never really offers a more interesting use than the ones it introduces the first moment after you put one on. The worlds can stretch through some neat visual styles, from jungle treetops to an M.C. Escher-style artistic maze, but even the nicest of them are undercut by repetitive terrain and peculiar dancing NPCs that disappear every time you get close (and a small handful have a downright nauseating screen warp effect that makes it actively hard to play). But all that color and some pretty great music don’t do much to differentiate their rudimentary level design. Every single one is still overburdened with a needless amount of costumes and held back by its restrictive control scheme, the combination of which prevents Balan Wonderworld’s platforming from ever forming a coherent voice of its own. The one place this trend is ever so slightly bucked is in its bosses, which do manage to flaunt Balan Wonderworld’s knack for character design. Bosses follow the cookie cutter three-hit formula to beat, but a neat little twist is that there are actually three different ways to deal damage that you have to figure out mid-fight. Each one you manage to use earns you a Statue, which makes them more like an action puzzle. That doesn’t really make them much fun to actually fight, as dodging their attacks and hitting back is still incredibly basic and often annoyingly unintuitive, but it is a place where Balan Wonderworld’s creativity feels better expressed. It’s certainly a preferable way to earn Statues than the “Balan’s Bout” bonus stages hidden throughout every level. These transport you to a timing-based minigame where Balan himself flies through a generic void inexplicably punching rocks for no discernible reason, with you trying to time button presses to annoyingly vague indicators to earn multipliers on the crystals you’ve collected. Every single Balan’s Bout reuses the same small pool of animations, takes far too long, and is incredibly harsh in its judgement – getting every button press perfect will earn you a gold medal and a Statue of its own, while even a single slightly mistimed one will drop you to a silver and deny you that reward. By the latter half of the campaign there are two or three of these in every single level, and you have to completely reload a level to take another crack at them, making the prospect of 100%ing any of Balan Wonderworld’s stages an absolute nightmare to consider. Completionists will get more bad news once the credits roll, as a third level opens up in each of the 12 worlds. These endgame stages ramp up the challenge a little bit, but probably in one of the more frustrating ways possible. The platforming puzzles are only marginally more complex, but now there are no purple costume gems scattered around except for some hidden special ones (like a somewhat familiar chargeable rocket roller skater). That means you have to rely on the supply of costumes you’ve collected elsewhere, and losing a specific one you need could not only halt your progress in that level but also potentially force you back to a different world to laboriously farm up on what you need. That crosses a threshold Balan Wonderworld mercifully doesn’t often reach: the point where my boredom transforms into frustration.  Between each level, you return to your pointless garden hub world full of pointless birds that spin a wheel to rack up pointless points. For anyone hoping this green, hilled zone is comparable to the Sonic Adventure series’ adorable Chao Garden, I regret to inform you that pretty much the only thing they have in common is the ability to force feed its cute critters crystals and then unceremoniously throw them through the air for a cruel laugh. There's very little interaction with these bird blobs otherwise, making the almost idle game-like nature of giving them crystals to make a generic counter go up perplexingly dull. The process of feeding them is a tedious one too, requiring you to walk to one of four colored flower patches to throw out the matching crystals you collect during a level – the catch here is that you throw them 10 at a time and there can seemingly only be 20 spawned in at once. Since the old ones will despawn if too many new ones arrive, you have to throw some out and then wait for your fluffy workers to slowly eat before throwing out more. That will then cause them to spin a wheel that builds superfluous structures in your hub, be it a “trampoline” for them to bounce on, part of a tower for them to adorably roll down, another trampoline, or even a third trampoline. Because you’re given zero motivation or explanation for any of this (what do the different color crystals do? Why am I building them so many trampolines? Where did one get a tiny hat from?), throwing out crystals becomes little more than a chore between levels, completely unlike the nuanced care I could give my Chao. What’s worse, because crystals are the primary item you’re meant to pick up besides Statues, their lack of value in the hub (the only place they are at all relevant) undermines the very act of collecting them. Backtracking to equip that music costume I mentioned earlier seems relatively fruitless when using its special bandstand only gets you four crystals to add to the hundreds your birds will greedily devour. By the end of the campaign I barely even cared about picking them up anymore – and when the main collectible of your 3D platformer starts to feel like more trouble than its worth, that’s a pretty catastrophic breaking point. Balan Wonderworld reminds me of some of the other platformers I played as a child, but not in a good way. It feels like a small subset of games that I enjoyed in the ‘90s, like Gex: Enter the Gecko or Bubsy, only to realize they were actually pretty bad once I grew out of my young naivete and looked back with more informed eyes. But both our options and our standards have increased dramatically since the days of the Nintendo 64. So even viewed with nostalgic eyes, Balan Wonderworld is less a throwback to a bygone era and more a derivative reminder of memories best left forgotten. Balan Wonderworld isn’t always an awful platformer, but it is a consistently boring one. It’s full of charming character designs and the occasional hint of a clever idea, but its insistence on being a one-button game with dozens of needlessly overlapping abilities that are thrown aside just as fast as they are introduced rots it to the core. It’s a mess of undercooked concepts and clunky mechanics that slow it to a crawl, and it seems to take inspiration from better games without properly recapturing what actually makes them fun. Its platforming never evolves beyond the most basic possible obstacles it can throw at you, but it's the fundamentally flawed choices behind that mediocrity that take Balan Wonderworld from unamusing to outright bad. "
Like all good detective stories, what appears simple at first becomes so much more than that in Disco Elysium – and here it gets so, so much weirder, too. It takes the age-old mechanics of tabletop RPGs like Dungeons &amp; Dragons and twists them in strange ways around a macabre tale of violence, poverty, and a society on the brink of collapse. Through sharply written dialogue and an expertly crafted world, it uses some unique game mechanics - such as debating against 24 different sections of your own brain - to create a story that will stay with me for a long time. And, somehow, it manages to make all of this fun and, surprisingly often, funny. Now with the addition of a fully voiced cast and even more side quests to embark on, The Final Cut makes an amazing game even better. If that isn’t varied enough for you, you can build your own detective from the ground up instead. Your character sheet is made up of four distinct pillars: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, and Motorics. Each of these consists of six wonderfully strange skills (like Intellect’s Encyclopedia), which bring their own bonuses. Want to command respect from a member of the public? Spend points on Authority. How about intimidate a witness? Beef up your Physical Instrument total. Want to talk to that necktie? Start messing with the David Lynch-inspired Inland Empire measurement.   His bass-heavy, calming yet authoritative voice guides you as much as it does educate you on the world of Revachol. The casting for this role was always going to be crucial to the success of The Final Cut, but after hearing the gravitas and depth Brown brings to it, it’s hard to imagine Disco Elysium any other way.   The upshot of all this skill management is that Disco Elysium plays like no other video game I’ve ever seen. Its closest analogue is perhaps the outstanding Divinity: Original Sin 2, if you replaced all of its turn-based combat with early-era LucasArts point-and-click scenarios. Puzzle-solving comes hand-in-hand with skill checks, which are interactions based on a combination of a dice roll and your stats. The higher your number for the requisite skill, the higher the percentage you have of rolling successfully. This mechanic is used to resolve everything from conversation options to jumps across ledges, and even violence.   Hold on though: there is no combat in Disco Elysium, not in the traditional sense anyway. Throwing a punch is a matter of willing your detective to do so, and the consequences are usually verbal rather than physical. For the most part, you’re armed with your (sometimes) silver tongue and a roll of the dice. Your choice of dialogue is often crucial to solving problems, not only when interacting with others, but with the many voices occupying your mind. It’s a truly fun way of dealing with exciting sequences and a welcome breath of fresh air compared to more action-oriented RPGs. I actually found talking my way through situations and building out my character sheet in Disco Elysium much more stimulating than the monotony of slicing down enemies with yet another +2 blade. Clothing positively and negatively affects your skills as well, which will be familiar to those acquainted with Bethesda RPGs. By putting on a replica hat worn by fictional detective Dick Mullen you can boost your Encyclopedia score by 1. Quick costume changes can come in handy when faced with a dice roll that looks too difficult at first glance. I once found myself confronted by a mural in an especially seedy part of town which required a substantial amount of Shivers – a skill that lets you “raise the hair on your neck” and “tune into the city” to decipher your environment. My character naturally had a low Shivers stat, but by putting on a pair of fancy shades and changing my jacket I soon had enough to make the percentage likelihood of my roll a tempting 72%. I went for it, got lucky, and swiftly changed back into my preferred getup. These are the moments when a little lateral thought is needed, each one serving as a mini-puzzle where you try to build up your stats with what resides in your inventory. You can also boost yourself by consuming alcohol or taking drugs, such as speed. These temporarily boost a whole pillar of your character sheet for an in-game hour, but come at the expense of your health or morale. I never really felt that this came at much of a risk, however, so I ended up consuming narcotics with regularity in order to gain that welcome boost up over the fence. In truth, I never had to play around with my inventory very often and wished I had more reason to do so. I found myself sticking with the same outfit for large portions of the adventure and yearned at times for a bit more challenge. Luckily, Disco Elysium has such a strong central story driving it along that I ultimately didn’t miss the lack of difficulty.   Other than increasing your skills, you can also spend points in your Thought Cabinet, a unique mechanic that turns abstract concepts like Communism, memories of favourite flavours, or just mistakenly thinking you’re a rockstar into a kind of mental inventory. It plays beautifully into the theme that half of the battle in Disco Elysium takes place in your mind. By internalizing a thought unlocked along your travels you can earn a variety of rewards attached to it. These vary from stat boosts to XP boosts and unique traits. They can also come with some major downsides, but part of the fun is not knowing what benefits you might get from ruminating on something like the “Volumetric Shit Compactor” for a while. For example, after seven hours gestating one thought called “The Wompty-Dompty Dom Centre”, I received a perk that gave me 10 XP every time I successfully used my Encyclopedia stat in conversation, but also lowered my Suggestion stat by two points because I’m a “pretentious wanker,” according to my own brain. It’s a wonderfully odd system, not least because each time you complete a thought a new and stunningly grotesque illustrative painting fills your screen, echoing Francisco Goya’s “Black Paintings” period – which is to say, they are laden with disturbing imagery reflecting a bleak outlook on humanity.    The original release included a lot of political theory and many of the dialogue choices you made influenced your characters leanings, from fascist to liberal and everything in between. However, there never felt like there was any sort of payoff or closure to whichever path you took. The Final Cut provides exactly what was missing by adding these quest lines late in the story, allowing you to fully commit to a branch of ideological thinking. In my playthrough of The Final Cut I chose to embrace Communism, which culminated in a bizarre, bewildering, and ultimately enriching conversation with two new characters I wouldn’t have met otherwise. Revachol and its socio-political history were always one of the key strengths of Disco Elysium, so naturally I was more than happy to delve deeper into that while simultaneously being given more opportunities to build out my protagonist and find his place in the world. The density of a game’s world can sometimes feel overwhelming, with maps dominated by icons and large areas of land beckoning to be explored. This is never the case with Disco Elysium; there’s lots to do, but it encourages you to take your time and absorb all the information you are being fed at your own pace. Whether you choose to take what you find at face value is for you to decide; You’re a detective, after all. You’ll probably want to click every prompt as well, and it’s hard to miss any due to the extremely useful ability to highlight any clickable item on the screen by holding Tab (something not uncommon to veterans of the adventure genre). Although sometimes deliberately obtuse in its dialogue and the way certain things are worded, crucially Disco Elysium never clouds what you’re meant to be doing. Tasks are clearly listed in the menu with a generous amount of hinting as to what you’re aiming to achieve; it’s an incredibly dense experience with my list of tasks quickly growing, but one I never felt bogged down in.   Core to this is Disco Elysium’s varied cast of characters and the way their stories intertwine with both your own and that of the world they inhabit. Each new face is accompanied by a gorgeously painted portrait that looks as if it’s been stroked onto a canvas by a hopped-up Francis Bacon. Every one feels fully formed and it’s clear to see from a quick look at their face or a few sentences in their company what their background is. They range from Cuno, a foul-mouthed boy who finds pleasure in throwing rocks at your subject’s suspended corpse (he is, frankly, a little shit) to Evrart Claire, a slimy union boss who looks cut from the same cloth as Jabba the Hutt. It’s rare to meet a kind face in Revachol, which makes it all the more special when you actually find yourself connecting to someone and having a conversation that actually borders on the polite... Chief among these connections is the one you’ll forge with your partner in crime-fighting, Lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi, a policeman brought in from another precinct to help with the case. You are strangers at first, and he can come across as cold and suspicious of your methods. But I enjoyed watching your bond form as the stakes continue to heighten. Kitsuragi’s dry humour and analytic mind is brought to life brilliantly in his voice acting and provides a reassuring tone during tense moments.   A couple of cast members remain, most notably those playing larger roles like Kim Kitsuragi and Evrat Claire, while others that had only partially voiced roles have been changed. These include Cuno, who’s new performance still carries the obnoxious essence of the character, but is nowhere near as grating on the ears as it once was. Practically all of the newly added cast members hit the mark as well, breathing new life into the world of Disco Elysium and further reinforcing the diversity that can be found in the city with a globe-full of accents and languages. The biggest compliment I can pay to the vocal additions is that all of the characters sounded exactly how I imagined they would when I first played. It mirrored the joy I get from first hearing an audiobook or film adaptation of one of my favourite novels, with the voices I once solely heard in my head finally played back to me.     There are two main plotlines to the story of Disco Elysium: the murder case you have been sent to Revachol to solve, and a more personal journey as you attempt to piece together your past and find out who you really are. These are both woven in and out like a poisonous vine by the societal issues at play in the city. There’s little else I can say about the plot without spoiling too much of the mystery – I urge you to discover the tale for yourself. With the sheer number of twists and branches it’s likely you’ll end up with a different end result than I did, anyhow. There are still a couple of key dice rolls that didn’t land in my favour that I can’t wait to go back and retry, just to see how differently it all could have gone. Ultimately, I was satisfied with the ending I got, even if I did leave a bit more of a mess behind me than I desired. It’s always difficult to put a bow on a story that promises so much, but Disco Elysium achieves its goal, even if I was left waiting for that one more twist, that one more revelation. Over the course of its 30 hours I couldn’t stop reading everything I picked up, learning more about the world I was in and the people that were suffering in it. If this seems all a bit much for you though, there is always the option to just give up. 15 minutes in I received my first game over screen after having a meltdown and giving into the murmurings of my ancient reptilian brain. Yes, Disco Elysium is definitely weird, and by no means a feel-good experience, but it's a highly smart one that I can’t wait to relive.  Disco Elysium is a unique blend of noir-detective fiction, traditional pen-and-paper RPGs, and a large helping of existentialist theory. Its twisting plot, cast of memorable characters, and sheer depth of choice combine to create an experience that begs to be savoured. It hits on every single one of the marks it sets out to achieve and left me yearning to spend more time in its world. Removing any of the minor gripes I had with the original by adding new quests and a full cast of well-voiced characters, The Final Cut elevates Disco Elysium from an already phenomenal RPG to a true must-play masterpiece.

259,Narita Boy ,6.0, Narita Boy left me conflicted like few other games have before. Its jaw-dropping neo-retro 2D aesthetic constantly treats your eyes to beautiful ‘80s themed backdrops, wildly imaginative character designs, and wonderfully fluid animations while a truly excellent synth-wave soundtrack perfectly underscores not only the action, and the emotional moments of its story are surprisingly poignant as well. But as far as actually playing it is concerned, Narita Boy is at best serviceable, with hollow exploration filled with constant backtracking, simple puzzles, and combat that never really evolves in ways that make tougher enemies any more fun to fight. And at its worst moments… well, let’s just say that thankfully it’s only at its worst for a fraction of its six or seven-hour length, because otherwise I’d need a whole lot more aspirin. You play as a young boy who suddenly gets dragged into a digital world after its creator, a genius hardware and software developer named Lionel Pearl, gets his memories stolen by a malicious program known as HIM. The boy assumes the role of the titular hero, “Narita Boy,” and sets out on an adventure to restore Lionel’s memories, defeat HIM, and save the digital world. However, that is a huge oversimplification of Narita Boy’s hard-to-follow overarching plot, which is bogged down with technical jargon and boring exposition dumps. Fortunately though, that setup is not the main attraction of Narita Boy’s story. The real meat of it is communicated as you unlock Lionel’s memories and play through 13 really well-done flashback sequences that chronicle his life all the way from childhood to the present. Each time I unlocked one it felt like a gift I couldn’t wait to unwrap: these bite-sized story sequences are easily the highpoint of Narita Boy as a whole, as Lionel’s story is an emotional one to watch unfold, with wonderful music box-like tunes adeptly setting the tone. What’s especially neat about them is the way they help bring better understanding to the digital world that you’re playing through. They tie together the digital and physical worlds in a way that’s rather clever.  As far as combat goes, Narita Boy looks more impressive than it actually feels to play. There are some really great animations, hits are impactful, and the way enemies die is super satisfying to look at – but the big problem is that, at the outset, there really isn’t much to your arsenal of moves outside of a basic three-hit sword combo, close-range shotgun blast, and powerful beam attack. That’s an alright base, but none of the abilities that you gain as you progress ever make engaging with combat any more fun. Rather than changing the way you approach a fight to keep things fresh, the techniques you unlock are more designed around giving you a way to deal with a specific new enemy type. For example, there’s a shoulder bash that’s only really used on one shielded enemy type, and an uppercut that’s primarily just used to hit the few enemies that fly. That makes them feel more like keys than actual techniques, only to be used when you see the right enemy-shaped lock. As a result, combat gets stale early on and stays that way. The one exception to this stagnancy is a dashing thrust attack that actually fits nicely into Narita Boy’s repertoire of moves as a way to hit a bunch of enemies in a row, in addition to being able to remove armor from a specific enemy. Of course, it’s one of the last techniques that you get, so I didn’t have much time to really enjoy using it in combat. And while there are an impressive number of enemy types throughout Narita Boy, they’re almost all disappointingly simple, with a single attack and a single way for you to avoid that attack. Eventually you gain the ability to use a Wildfire power up and can toggle between red, blue, and yellow auras, which makes you deal and take more damage against enemies of the same color. But while it’s great to have an extra layer to think about in combat to break the routine of it all, it fails to make fights any more fun since you pretty much just kill enemies in one hit when you’re matched with their color. None of this means that combat in Narita Boy is outright bad, and I wouldn’t even go as far as to say that it’s shallow, because the enemies do require that you learn their patterns, as simple as they are. It just never rises above that baseline level of what combat should be in an action platformer like this, leaving it somewhat amusing but relatively one-note the whole way through when compared to evolving games like Ori or Guacamelee. Platforming and exploration follow the same trail limped along by Narita Boy’s combat: they never really cross that threshold of being anything better than just “fine” on a fundamental level. The world of Narita Boy may be absolutely gorgeous to look at, with visually spectacular backdrops throughout each of its three major color-coded zones, but I eventually grew numb to them; running back and forth between them over and over again, picking up and delivering keys while trying to keep track of which ones are for which locks without any sort of map drains them of their novelty after a while.  Each area of Narita Boy is capped off with a big event to transition into the next one, and usually these are among the highpoints of the whole campaign. Surfing on a floppy disc and transitioning from skidding along the water’s surface to jumping back onto solid ground is good fun, as is the power fantasy of transforming into a giant robot and utterly smashing everything in your way. But there’s one transition in Narita Boy that I need to talk about in detail, because it is the closest I’ve ever gotten to rage-quitting a game that I was assigned to review. Upon clearing the Yellow House area you have to ride on a stag in a very familiar speeder bike-esque section that you’ve probably seen a hundred times in other games – think Bit.Trip Runner’s side-scrolling obstacle dodging, just without the rhythm element. But here you’re moving extremely fast and the obstacles that you need to jump over are just a little too hard to see. Even more frustrating is that in order to avoid taking damage from certain enemies, you have to boost through them. The problem is that when you boost you move so fast, and it pushes you so far to the right side of the screen, that it becomes practically impossible to react to whatever is coming next. The result is a two-minute-long blurry obstacle course that largely comes down to memorization, much like that infamous Battletoads level pretty much everyone has hated since 1991. But while Battletoads has that hardcore appeal of being a difficult game all the way through, Narita Boy is otherwise a very easy game, and this awful level comes out of absolutely nowhere. It’s made worse by the fact that the mechanic meant for giving you health back, which is boosting through a string of enemies, often doesn’t work and has you still taking damage for seemingly no reason, even during a part that seems explicitly designed to let you heal. It’s headache-inducing, it doesn’t work as intended, and it almost completely ruined Narita Boy as a whole for me – but thankfully this short section is also the only moment like it. There’s so much to love about Narita Boy’s style, which makes its comparably simple combat and exploration all the more sad to see. Its 2D sprite work, animations, and soundtrack are among the best I’ve come across this year, and the story told through its unlockable memories is still is worth playing through the mediocre action platformer built around it to experience – at least, every part except that borderline broken speeder bike-style level, which is in desperate need of a post-launch patch. "
260,It Takes Two ,9.0, A healthy marriage is like the ultimate co-op game: You have to know when to give and take, when to push and pull, and when to talk and when to listen. But most importantly, you must always remember when it’s your turn to take the garbage out - something Hazelight Studios has certainly done during the development of the almost entirely garbage-free It Takes Two. This utterly superb co-op platformer manages to cram in enough unique and exhilarating gameplay ideas to give Shigeru Miyamoto a migraine, with not a single dud among them.   One moment Cody and May are collaboratively steering a giant pencil around a connect-the-dots picture, the next they’re casting spells and swinging swords as a wizard and barbarian in an isometric dungeon crawl. Before you know it they’ll be hopping along the tumbling crystalised interior of a kaleidoscope, and just when you think it must be out of ideas Cody will be piloting a tiny plane through the treetops while May squares off in a Street Fighter-style showdown with a member of the local squirrel militia on its wings. It just shifts seamlessly from one brilliantly bonkers style of gameplay to another, each with its own fresh set of mechanics, and almost none of it is ever recycled at any point. It Takes Two is like a box of donuts in your office breakroom: it arrives fresh, is gleefully devoured, and absolutely nothing included in it stays long enough to grow stale. Importantly, every action feels fantastic to perform. The platforming essentials are on point, with May and Cody’s jump, double-jump, and air-dash abilities being supremely responsive and allowing for effortless levels of platforming precision. But it’s the complimentary, character-specific abilities that are refreshed in each chapter that compelled me and my partner to work as a team and make It Takes Two a special style of platformer, turning seemingly simple ascents up the side of a cliff face into carefully choreographed back-and-forths and coordinated chants of “3-2-1-Go!”  It Takes Two also has the ability to effortlessly make mirth out of the mundane. In real life, my children’s fidget spinners seem like pointless trinkets, the forgotten remnants of a passing fad now cluttering up shelf space. In It Takes Two, they are whirring hoverboards that allow you to surf your way over giant inflatable slides, pulling spectacular midair tricks like a pair of tiny Tony Hawks.  Additionally, while a lot of the elements in It Takes Two’s environments are there to serve a very clear gameplay purpose, a substantial amount of objects are interactive for no other reason than because they’re fun. The giant bass drum kick pedal plays no part in you reaching a level goal, but you can still buttstomp onto it and thump its hammer into a towering drum, because it’s fun. The carefully lined-up dominoes in the cardboard castle area might well be a static backdrop in any other game, but in It Takes Two you can topple them all over and knock a hapless small soldier into a bottomless pit, because it’s fun. It’s very much the Mario method of cramming as much magical interactivity into every square inch of each play space, and ensures that your every curious action goes rewarded. The fact that It Takes Two blesses you with infinite lives and extremely generous checkpointing, only makes you more emboldened to experiment. The only real gripe that I can level at It Takes Two is aimed squarely at the character of Dr. Hakim. This walking and talking ‘Book of Love’ acts as a guide for May and Cody on their journey towards rekindling the love in their marriage, and he’s basically insufferably cringy right from his first appearance early on, and that doesn’t change in the numerous cutscenes he shows up in throughout. The only positive thing about him is that any time he does appear you know you’re about to be handed some natty new plaything or game-changing ability, so I never felt too sad to see him even if each and every one of his lines had me rolling my eyes rather than rolling with laughter. dir=""ltr""  Of course, a lot of the marriage metaphors went over the head of my 10-year-old son who was partnering me on the adventure, and it made me wish for a game like this that was made more for a parent to share their love of gaming with a child as opposed to a couple playing together. Even so, it didn’t really impact the enjoyment we shared because so much of the contextual bickering and banter between the couple on screen was drowned out by our own laughing and shouting as an impromptu snowball fight broke out or we struggled to cooperatively draw a smiley face on a giant Etch-a-Sketch. It Takes Two is a spectacular co-op adventure that lays down a path of great gameplay ideas and uses it to play a giddy game of hopscotch. It’s beautiful, breakneck-paced, and bubbling over with creativity, and playfulness and experimentation are rewarded at every turn. If you have any kind of co-op partner in your life, be they spouse, friend, sibling, or other (even a child, though the themes might be too mature for them), It Takes Two is a truly joyful trip you really need to take together.

261,Monster Hunter Rise ,8.0, There’s nothing quite like piloting a fire-breathing T-rex like a runaway train through an overflowing volcano before using it to beat the crap out of a dragon. In a series already known for providing thrilling battles you can’t really get elsewhere, Monster Hunter Rise still manages to surprise and delight. Its scope and progression can feel flatter than that of Monster Hunter World at its launch (including a conspicuous lack of Elder Dragons), making it seem like a foundation waiting to be built upon – but after spending dozens of hours with Rise’s wonderfully enhanced mobility and faster pace, it’s going to be hard to ever go back to the way things were before. For those new to the series, Monster Hunter Rise is all about killing or capturing giant, spectacular monsters and turning them into pairs of pants (among other pieces of gear), this time with an awesome feudal Japanese theme throughout. Each hunt is essentially an epic boss fight against a specific monster or two, all of which are incredibly diverse in both visual design and behavior; a successful hunt earns you materials used to craft better equipment that will, in turn, allow you to take down harder monsters – and so on and so forth. Success relies on a healthy balance of preparation and skill, and it’s kept fresh by the variety of 14 radically different weapons types you can swap between, the strategic puzzle of breaking and severing specific parts of a monster rather than just whacking at it mindlessly, and the everlasting allure of that next piece of sweet gear.  The systems that house all that depth have given Monster Hunter a reputation for being daunting to learn, but 2018’s Monster Hunter World shattered that barrier by streamlining many aspects and making the series accessible to a wider audience than ever before. (For context, World outsold the previously most popular game in the series by at least 11 million copies, so for a huge chunk of current Monster Hunter fans it’s all they’ve ever known.) That’s relevant here because Rise feels a little more like a follow-up to the most recent Switch entry, Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate, that benefits from many of World’s impressive evolutions rather than a successor to World itself – which makes some sense, given World never came to Switch and Rise is a Switch exclusive (until it comes to PC next year). That means there’s a mix of old and new ideas here, some of which are more successful than others. For example, much of the streamlining World did has been carried forward, including tweaks like load-free maps, weapon-sharpening whetstones not being consumable, and healing items being usable while walking – all of which feel vital after spending hundreds of hours with them in World. Meanwhile, other things like separate Village and Hub questlines for single- and multiplayer and the ability to tweak a weapon’s playstyle a bit return from older Monster Hunter games. This mishmash of old ideas with some compelling new ones of its own makes Rise feel like a huge mechanical step forward compared to Generations Ultimate, but more of a sidestep in the context of World and its Iceborne expansion. Story has never been the point of a Monster Hunter game (Capcom has a series literally called Monster Hunter Stories for that), so it’s no surprise that the one in Rise is as thin as tissue paper. It’s told through a scant few cutscenes where English voice acting is stutteringly dubbed to match what appear to be unaltered Japanese lip flaps in a way that does neither any favors. That doesn’t make the fights around those scenes any less exciting, but it’s important to point out that the improvements World made weren’t only mechanical. Its story wasn’t much thicker, but it did provide a nice sense of discovery and continuity that made it feel like you were actually exploring its new continent. I missed that a little in Rise, where unlocking new areas or being sent on key hunts rarely had much relation to the story or your actions in it – and again, that’s not a deal breaker by any means or even necessarily something I’m looking for from Monster Hunter, but it’s still a place Rise takes a noticeable step backward from World. But minor issues like that are far overshadowed by the massive (literal) leap forward Rise takes in the hunts themselves. Monster Hunter is about hunting some dang monsters, and here the options available, locations to fight in, and techniques to do so with are, on the whole, superb. And while the Switch’s comparably weak hardware means things don’t look quite as crisp as I got used to with World, it’s frankly remarkable how close Rise gets. That includes how well it generally runs, as well as load times that are shockingly fast both in and out of hunts. Capcom also deserves a special shoutout for making an online system that just works, letting you join the lobbies of your Switch friends with little to no hassle. That’s become a frustratingly infrequent standard of living on the Switch (I’m looking at you, Animal Crossing). I was impressed with the immediate variety of monsters Rise throws at you too, using a more straightforward variation on the older Key Quest system to let you pick from a wide variety of hunts right away, and then only requiring you to complete a set handful of your choice before you’re able to move on to the next tier. Story be damned: that flexibility is greatly appreciated. The only drawback is that the variety of monsters also feels like it peaks quicker as a result – there are plenty to fight, but it seemed like I had also seen the bulk of them by the time I finished Rise’s singleplayer Village questline, leaving the second half of its progression in the Hub a little less surprising. But one of Monster Hunter’s oldest and best tricks is that reaching High Rank – a harder tier of Hub hunts that up the difficulty and rewards – doesn’t just tack on more health and damage to each monster’s stats, it fundamentally alters their fights. You’ll see some new moves and more aggressive behavior across the whole menagerie, making the higher numbers that accompany them only part of what reignites their sense of danger. This is by no means new to Rise, but it’s one of the most important things Monster Hunter does because it helps keep fights against the same monsters fresh and exciting. And goodness gracious, what good monsters there are this time around! There are more than 30 to take down, about a third of which are brand new to Rise (though there are a handful imported from World as well, so Generations Ultimate players will have even more fresh tails to chop off). Best of all, pretty much every single new addition is an absolute banger. They’re all excellently designed, both in their looks and their combat styles, and easily account for some of my favorite hunts in Rise. That includes the ridiculous bird-monkey Bishaten throwing persimmons at you, the sumo-inspired platypus-turtle Tetranadon, and the elegant fire-crane Aknosom who has some of the coolest looking armor and weapons available. Speaking of weapons, visual variety is immediately noticeable across the board here, which feels like a direct response to a common complaint with World. Almost right off the bat designs range from incredibly badass to incredibly silly, though their looks then don’t evolve as much as you upgrade them. Similar to the monster variety, that can leave Rise feeling a touch flatter in its last half than I initially anticipated, both in visuals and power level; for example, I was a little surprised to find I basically didn’t need to switch off the simple Insect Glaive from the Ore Tree (which, hilariously, just looks like a rifle) for nearly all of High Rank.  Just about every weapon in Monster Hunter Rise has been touched or tweaked in some way, big or small. And while I was playing alongside IGN’s Wikis team, who have plenty of experience across all sorts of weapons, I almost exclusively use the Insect Glaive. A lot more has changed with this weapon relative to its most recent appearance in World than it might seem on the surface, but since many folk are like me and simply stick to their main choice, I figured I’d break down a bit of it here so that those who aren’t interested can safely skip ahead. While the Glaive’s initial moveset is largely unchanged from World, the Switch Skills that let you alter certain attacks can have a fairly significant impact on your combos if you choose to use them. I was a fan of both alternative options because they swap slower big hits for rapid attacks, and that appeals to my playstyle I enjoy since the Glaive’s agility is one of my favorite things about it. Plus one of them is a draw attack that lets you spin forward in a flurry of blows and automatically throws you into the air with a dodge if you get hit while attacking, which is just so dang fun. And while the Glaive’s Silkbind moves initially struck me as uninteresting aerial maneuvers for a weapon that arguably needs them the least, the one bound to ZL+A became an absolute staple of my hunts. It’s basically an emergency dodge button with a ridiculously large invincibility window, letting me deal damage longer and still get away clean. The only shame is that the ZL+X option is less useful, acting more as a way to leap into a fight – I prefer to use Rise’s signature new Wirebug system defensively, and the Silkbind Switch Skill you unlock in High Rank can unfortunately only be swapped with the one I actually did use. But the most drastic changes the Glaive received actually have to do with the Kinsects that accompany them. Kinsect nurturing is gone, and instead you’ll simply unlock more bug varieties to buy as you progress, with a Kinsect Level assigned to each Glaive that determines their stats. Kinsect types are also split into three different categories now: Powder, which are the only type that can auto attack and leave detonatable clouds behind, as before; Speed, which charge up while on your arm before dealing extra damage on their first hit when sent out; and Assist, which attack alongside you when you have all three essences collected for improved anime flair (and damage). This is actually an incredible change, specializing each type into a particular playstyle preference where World gave you very little reason not to just pick one of the fastest options. In fact, completely rocking my world, the iconic Pseudocath ended up being one of my least favorite options in Rise. Its speed is helpful, but the Assist Kinsects can actually guarantee they collect either a red or white essence no matter where you hit, massively speeding up close-range collection and guaranteeing I always had my red attack combos available. But that’s just what I preferred, and someone else might like the dust clouds that are now exclusive to the Powder type more. In any case, the fact that there’s more of a real choice now is what’s impressive.  Regardless of the weapon you wield, the most powerful new tool at your disposal in Rise is available to everyone: the Wirebug. Wirebugs are a recharging resource that let you jump through the air, scale any wall, recover from big hits, and use special Silkbind moves of your own. It’s hard to overstate how much they influence the pace both in and out of combat. Suddenly, Rise not only doesn’t have loading screens between its map zones, it barely has boundaries at all as you scale mountains and jump vast distances. And when you are in the heat of battle, Wirebugs can instead be used on special moves unique to each weapon, ranging from epic attacks to more maneuverability. But probably the move with the most impact when it comes to changing the pace of combat itself is also the most subtle: if you get knocked back by a big hit, pressing ZL+B will use a Wirebug to pop you back onto your feet with your weapon sheathed. That may not sound like a gamechanger on the surface, but the amount of downtime it cuts out during a fight is potentially huge. Taking a hit is now an opportunity instead of a setback, letting you quickly re-engage without missing a beat or immediately heal up while stepping aside (with potions now giving you half their healing right away to speed things up even further). This move is Rise in a nutshell: trim the fat, fill the dead air, and get you moving ASAP. Simply put, it absolutely rules, and I’m not sure I ever want Monster Hunter to go without Wirebugs again. You can see that philosophy clearly in other places too, such as how Rise takes Iceborne’s excellent monster riding concept a step further by giving you full control of a rideable doggo buddy that’s way faster than sprinting around on foot. But more than that, some of the pre-hunt prep, like certain food buffs and tool choices, have been simplified or moved into mid-mission collectibles. While preparation is still key, you can now dive into a mission and pick up stat buffs and useful Endemic Life to fill some of that gap while you go. The most important of these are the colorful Spiribirds dotted around every map, each color of which will increase either your health, stamina, attack, or defense up to a certain cap. I really enjoyed that these not-insignificant stat buffs were earned through exploration rather than menu management, and figuring out the optimal routes on each map to collect them before heading toward the fight was an amusing puzzle (one I could ignore against weaker monsters to save time). On the other hand, spending five to ten minutes at the start of most hunts following the same trail of birds in order to max out my stats can become a different type of tedious, and I did begin to miss simply selecting the additional buffs I wanted more directly through meals. It’s ultimately an interesting experiment that takes advantage of Rise’s enhanced movement, but one I wouldn’t miss nearly as much as the movement itself. I get a similar feeling from the newly expanded monster riding system, which is equal parts cool and insane. Dealing damage with certain attacks (or if another monster lays on the pain itself) will eventually put a monster into a rideable state, but unlike previous games where that monster is then still ravenous and unwieldy, Rise gives you complete control of it. You can pilot them like your dog, ram them into walls at will, and even use their light and heavy attacks with a combo and parry system that’s surprisingly nuanced in its timings. You have a lot of time to do all this too, letting you drive monsters all the way across the map in order to do kaiju battle with another one, dropping extra materials and doling out some serious damage. It’s an absolute blast, but the side effect is that the other monsters on a map are transformed from beasts to be feared into tools to be used. Gone are those thrilling moments where another monster shows up unexpectedly and throws a monkey wrench into your fight in hilarious fashion – maybe some people will be happy about that lack of chaos, but it makes those monsters barely different from the tiny Endemic Life waiting to be picked up, which is a little strange. There are copious ways to easily ride or lure monsters into fights, and it wasn’t uncommon for me to use three or four different monsters to beat down my actual target in the course of a 20-minute hunt. Again, that’s exciting, but it also means that Rajang I used to fear is now little more than a club to be wielded. (The notorious Deviljho and Bazelguese aren’t in Rise, but I’m honestly not sure their imposing interruptions would even work here.) This is a feeling that persists a bit in Rise’s new Rampage hunts, too. Rampages are basically a weird blend between Monster Hunter and a tower defense game, letting you setup ballistas, cannons, and more to defend gates against waves of monsters. It’s an odd but fun novelty of a thing, reminiscent of past siege fights like Kulve Taroth but with significantly more customizability and a lot less pressure. The monsters that plow toward your gate are significantly weaker than usual, and you’ll spend a decent amount of each rampage at a turret peppering them with bolts, bombs, and even machine gun fire rather than on the ground with your weapon which can be a neat change of pace. It’s a very entertaining side mode, and one that greatly benefits from a party of friends so you can share the multitasking madness of base defense – one person could man a turret while another sets up new defenses and a third shovels coal into a kiln that reduces the cooldown on powerful superweapons like the recognizable Dragonator and what is essentially an aerial nuke. I’ve certainly enjoyed completing Rampages, but they also don’t change much from run to run, really only modified by a variety of straightforward subgoals to increase your final score, like stunning a certain number of monsters. There are only four possible stronghold layouts to defend, and while the monsters attacking might change visually, a Khezu and a Basarios will basically break your gate the same way. The real return draw of them is taking on the super-strong Apex monsters that cap off some High Rank Rampages, but eventually I just wished I could fight those out in the field instead of having to do the same tower defense song and dance again before they appeared. That said, Rampages do reward you for your time fairly well, offering a smattering of crafting materials from every type of monster present and boatload of Defender Tickets. These can be used to customize your weapons with a new system called Rampage Skills, allowing you to tweak them with your choice of one of three additional bonuses. That could be between simple stuff like increasing attack, defense, or affinity, but some also offer more unique effects like increasing damage as your weapon dulls or dealing more damage to airborne enemies, among other things. Rampage Skills are also accompanied by a nifty Rampage weapon of each type, which is basically a blank slate onto which you can apply three Rampage Skills instead of one, letting you design your own custom tool of destruction. Couple that customizability with another new system called Switch Skills, which lets each weapon swap out a few specific moves for alternate ones, and Rise returns some of the previous playstyle nuance that World streamlined away. These choices generally didn’t have a clear correct answer (although I am sure min-maxers will figure out some optimal combination before long), presenting choices like swapping a strong overhead strike with a fast forward spin and emphasizing personal preference more than pure power. There seem to only be three Switch Skills per weapon as of now, one of which is a Silkbind move, but that’s at least enough to change how a weapon handles in a noticeable way. It’s a shame, then, that Rise currently lacks any sort of endgame to really push the limits of all the choice it offers. It took me just under 50 hours to see basically everything there is to see and finish the story – that’s certainly not short, and I still have a few optional quests to unlock improved meal options or Switch Skills for other weapons, but Rise ends with an unsatisfying cliffhanger and feels like it’s missing that last layer to really test you. I was disappointed to see there’s no additional challenges unlocked once you reach this point, no Tempered monsters, no replayable area like Iceborne’s Guiding Lands, and no Elder Dragons – some of Monster Hunter’s most challenging and exciting adversaries – apart from a couple that can only be fought in special encounters (which, avoiding spoilers, are at least extremely cool). Couple that with its relatively flat-feeling equipment and progression and Rise ends up looking more like an excellent foundation for Capcom to build upon rather than a deep game of its own at launch. That’s not to say there’s nothing here as is though, and the excellent support World received gives me plenty of faith that Rise will grow in one way or another. Its first free content update has even already been scheduled for the end of April – but it’s probably good it’s that soon, as I’m running out of personal goals to keep me hunting faster than I expected to. Monster Hunter Rise mixes classic Monster Hunter ideas with some of World’s best improvements and a whole bunch of clever new mechanics of its own. Not all of them are slam dunks, but they are all fun – and the introduction of Wirebugs and the mobility they bring to every fight is so great I never want to give them up. The post-launch updates Capcom is already teasing can’t come soon enough, but Monster Hunter Rise is still a thrilling step forward in the series’ evolution toward the new normal World so boldly introduced.

262,Loop Hero ,8.0, Traditionally, some of the best stuff in an RPG is the combat. The tactical decisions, crunching numbers, the strategizing, conserving strength for future encounters. But what's left if you take away character control and just about everything but crunching stat numbers and filling in the map? You get Loop Hero, and it turns out to be a game full of compellingly unique ideas and a weird fantasy world that demands attention. There's nothing quite like this strange combination of idle game autobattler with roguelite deckbuilding and puzzley tile placement. This exploratory experiment drew me in so deeply with its buffet of synergies and clever strategies that I lost track of time while playing more often than not. I only escaped because once its stat-building puzzles are solved there’s not much more to it.   Everything is forgotten except, of course, your lone hero, who walks a circular path through the void, fighting monsters and — crucially — remembering things before coming back to a campfire to rest. You have strange, dreamlike conversations with the people and creatures you meet, from bandits unsure why they're stealing to goblins who have somehow remembered themselves right into existence. The conversations and unlockable tidbits of lore are wonderfully meandering oddities.   In those first few minutes you won't do much, quite literally, as battles are hands-off. Once you're in a fight your fate is controlled by your and your enemies' Attack Speed, Defense, and Damage stats, with a dash of whether or not the percentage chance gods give you more Crits, Counters, and Evades than the other side. This even goes for boss battles: it’s very strictly your stats vs theirs. So for the first few uneventful loops, well, it's a good time to fill your water glass or grab some snacks in the kitchen.  But Loop Hero soon gets you occupied and challenged – and this is where the ability to pause between battles becomes essential. As your hero fights they earn cards representing map tiles among their other loot, and the conceit is that placing these tiles makes the hero “remember” that features like forest groves, mountains, villages, rivers, and more were actually part of the world all along, restoring them to reality.   Watching the map go from blank slate to overwhelming collage is a rewarding sense of progression that at least somewhat makes up for the lack of customization in your character. That said, the muted palette isn't going to be to everyone's tastes, nor is the chunky pixel font all of the text and stats appear in. (Which you can change, thankfully, to something easier on the eyes or dyslexic friendly.)  The loot that drops in battle is a big part of what keeps you busy: while it’s fairly robotic early on, you soon have to stop and think about which stats are best for your class. Does your Warrior want to buff his automatic health regen or his vampirism to gain health with every strike? What stats will your Necromancer sacrifice for the ability to summon an additional skeleton into their posse of the dead? You’re often swapping out one sword or magic ring for a shiny new one, but this is where Loop Hero leans too hard into randomness: If you don’t get the weapon drop you need for a couple of loops you're just out of luck as your damage doesn't keep up.   Your biggest angle of customization is in Loop Hero’s roguelite-style progression between expeditions when you choose which of your unlocked map tiles you bring in your deck, and how those tiles relate to each other by synergizing into new forms. For instance, a three-by-three cluster of nine mountains transforms into a huge peak, and a town will give you more health if it has wheat fields adjacent. Because you have so little control over your actual hero, much of mastering Loop Hero is about searching out these bonuses, deciphering the way that they could benefit you, and figuring out the optimal combination of terrain for each of the three hero classes. It is a remarkably simple set of rules, and that’s a big part of what's good about Loop Hero. Place tiles, equip gear, get loot, go to camp, repeat. At the same time, that simplicity wore on me when I binged for hours at a time: there's a certain amount of grind you have to do in order to progress. I did expeditions fairly often not with the goal of fighting and defeating the boss, but just to repeat the same combos a few times and gain resources so I could retreat and purchase a critical upgrade back home. That just feels anticlimactic and low-stakes.   The thing is, when I call those upgrades incremental I really mean it. They’re simple, straightforward and, frankly, bland. You get more health, more damage, more attack speed. They don't shake up how you play other than unlocking the two additional classes, which happens early on. Loop Hero's biggest fault is that aside from the scale of the fiction and the ingenuity of the base concept it's not ambitious or creative in the details of its design. It doesn't provide variety or shake things up often enough to avoid becoming stale. There are clear optimal ways to build your character – and after you stumble on them there's very little incentive to try anything else. Shockingly creative in its fantasy fiction setup and addictive in its largely automated gameplay, Loop Hero is something new and interesting in the realm of RPGs and it does not disappoint. It stops short of being revolutionary though, and its reliance on a tired grind and dull stats is weak in comparison to roguelikes that emphasize trying unique new builds over optimizing existing combos. That gives it a shorter lifespan than many of its contemporaries – but there’s nothing quite like it. "
263,Harvest Moon: One World ,5.0, Somewhere in Harvest Moon: One World there's a really interesting seed of an idea for a new take on farming sims, which would be much appreciated after 25 years of very similar games. And in the right hands, turning a farming simulator series into a plot-driven, exploration-focused adventure game sounds like a brilliant idea. And yet One World fails in just about every way to do anything interesting or innovative with this new idea other than layer it on top of a deeply mediocre farming sim.   But the one world of One World is boring in every way. Everything looks bland, except for the named character models, which are exactly fine. Towns are dull and empty with just a couple identical houses each, the areas between them are mostly long and same-ish paths, and everything just looks flat and simple. There's no detail, no personality – just long stretches of empty space, maybe with a tree thrown in if you're lucky.   The aesthetics of One World are not where the mundanity ends. Unlike other Harvest Moon games where you get to know a town of distinct and personable neighbors, there are few actual developed characters in One World outside of its roster of bachelors and bachelorettes and one other named character in each area. The vast majority of the cast is made up of same-looking individuals with names like ""Awkward Man"" or ""Thoughtful Woman"" whose only personality trait is sending you endless mail to ask you to bring them random items. And that’s a terrible idea because again, these characters tend to disappear completely at certain times of day, sometimes right in front of your eyes, and sometimes as you’re about to turn in a quest. The bachelors and bachelorettes have a bit more going for them in the personality department, but are still largely pretty samey in the end. They all care about their respective towns, they need your help saving them, and they think the main character is neat. For the most part, they are distinguished almost entirely by their looks and what town they hang out in the most. Marrying one is inconsequential, seeming almost like an afterthought gated behind a lot of time spent in the extremely boring mines and, for some reason, finishing the main plot – you can't get married until then. You can have a kid eventually too, but your offspring take after your spouse’s side of the family in that they do nothing interesting whatsoever.        There's a lot of potential here for fun experimentation with where you put your farm and what you grow and when, but it's never realized. The problem with all this is that nothing is ever really explained. After 20+ hours into One World, with the Harvest Goddess resurrected and the main story finished, I'm still not entirely clear how they work. There's no real log that indicates exactly how to get which mutations even after you've already obtained them, and even if you plant the same crop in the same region at the same time, it doesn't always seem to mutate. I'm sure there's a trick here I'm missing, and while mutations are largely inconsequential (I've been able to find seeds for all the mutations I've made so far separately as well), it's really frustrating if you're trying to grow, say, an Asparagus from regular Asparagus seeds for a quest, but keep getting Purple Asparagus instead and have no idea why.   That was just one example, but this obtuse quest and upgrade design became a frustrating hindrance repeatedly throughout One World, with many progression quests requiring specific seeds or tool upgrades and no hint at all as to where those might be found. Your best bet, outside of a guide online, is just to talk to everyone constantly and repeatedly and do every single quest possible until you accidentally stumble over the thing you're looking for.   The best I can say about One World is that it's fine – something you can mindlessly play on mute with a podcast on and feel not-horrible about. That said, with two Story of Seasons games out within a month of this and Stardew Valley's 1.5 update on top of that, I can’t think of a reason why anyone who loves the Harvest Moon tradition should play One World. It's lacking just about every possible forward-moving feature any similar games have, and its attempts at doing something new with the series are half-baked and frustrating. Harvest Moon: One World has a novel idea for an exploration-focused farming game, but then sets that idea in an empty, uninteresting world. Its characters are dull, its quests are often confusing or frustrating, and it lacks the personality of just about any other farming sim option out there, including most of its direct predecessors. At best, One World's farming elements are satisfying enough to mindlessly pass the time with, but there's just not much else here... and so much else in other games in this genre. "
264,Breathedge ,5.0, Trapping you in a vast field of space wreckage with nothing more than an immortal chicken for company, Breathedge is a survival-adventure game with an undeniably novel setup. Instead of punching trees, you'll navigate a three-dimensional, zero-gravity environment in order to snag supplies, craft tools, and avoid suffocation, all while trying to uncover the twisting plot behind the crash of the largest space liner in history – which happened with you on it. Despite the fresh setting, you'll only get a taste of some rudimentary survival gameplay before a scripted story takes over and drives you out of the survival mechanics entirely. The sense that another wondrous discovery is just around the corner is what drives these games... and Breathedge doesn't have it. Breathedge is desperate to please with its jokes, slapstick humor, and goofy concepts like corpse-powered coffin robots. It's self-aware that it's a single-player, story-driven survival game and makes references to tropes of the genre (as well as other sci-fi games like Alien: Isolation and Mass Effect), including gags about shoehorned plot contrivances, artificially extended wait times, stale gameplay, and fetch quests. Unfortunately, Breathedge is guilty of the things it makes jokes about, full of the most tedious, repetitive kinds of survival game clichés. Even when I was laughing, its awareness of these issues doesn't make them any less of a problem, and humor isn’t a substitute for innovative gameplay.  Breathedge’s main contribution to survival games is its movement, which is at least different enough to make the early routine novel. It was fun to putter a round in microgravity at first, bouncing off things and peeking behind asteroids. It's amusing to snag floating resources out of the debris field that surrounds you. Many of the ruined spaceships that make up its world and the environments within it are designed quite well, with new things to find often hidden nearby or enticingly placed in plain view across a distance that you're not sure how to cross yet. The layout of the early survival areas is one of Breathedge's greatest strengths, feeling both very deliberately designed and like they could be real places. Which is good, since you tend to go back and forth through the same parts of them over and over and over. That's because everything you do is limited by your air supply, which you have to constantly keep an eye on. Your ticking clock will peak at only around 10 or 15 minutes, and that’s if you devote lots of inventory space to oxygen refills. Generally I had far less time than that to explore and gather before I needed to retreat to a source of air… then tediously wait for my air supply to refill, which can take two minutes. Then I'd travel back out and get a few minutes of work done (if I was lucky) either exploring or gathering resources before I had to go fill up my oxygen again. The idea of limited air supply works a lot better in a game like Subnautica because when you’re running low on air all you have to do is swim straight up for a quick breather before returning to the interesting things you were doing. In addition to tediously waiting for your air to refill, you also have to wait for crafting to finish, which involves watching a bar slowly fill as you do nothing at all. You’ll also need to wait for research to finish, which operates on a timer of 15 minutes or more that goes down no matter what you're doing. Killing time like this is absurd in a single-player game with no time pressure otherwise. It does nothing but make Breathedge longer. So most of your time is spent either waiting for a bar to fill or collecting resources. In true survival game fashion, you collect resources to make the things you need to go collect more, different resources, all in order to build some other thing to advance the plot. Gathering resources is as simple as moving around to snag floating things or getting out a new tool from your inventory (for some bizarre reason you only have four quickbar slots) to click on a static object with it. Doing all that in zero gravity starts out novel, but it never evolves in a way to keep it interesting, and even lacks any satisfying sound or animation to accompany it. No terrain deformation, no automatic or upgraded gatherers, no factories – no real meaningful base-building at all, actually. It's just a lot of clicking and hand-crafting, offering what’s essentially the most basic, early gameplay of games like Subnautica, Empyrion, or ARK without any of the significantly more efficient and fun advancement that comes later. Meanwhile, your oxygen has ticked down and you'll need to go back to refill it. Oh, and your frustratingly flimsy tools broke midway through doing that. I frequently carried two copies of every tool because one wouldn't even last through the most basic expeditions. Why force me to recreate tools when a repair system would work just as well? Why not provide upgraded versions with increased durability for more than a single one of the five common tools? These are problems plenty of survival games have solved already, but Breathedge ignores them all. Your reward for success in here is to do the same thing over again, and I felt punished for doing well. When you build a base, for example, making it bigger means you get to spend more time plugging oxygen leaks with chewing gum every time you come home. There's no automation or efficiency upgrades to be found, nor are there advanced tools that change how you play or give you new resources. Aside from a few cosmetic things to construct, there's barely any progression at all. The stuff you do in the first hour is the stuff you’ll be doing for the next 15. It's the worst kind of survival gameplay, making all the simplest mistakes from games that came before it. For example, even as you get faster travel methods or gear to speed up exploration or reduce the burden of your air supply, the environments get bigger to match. A few more seconds of speed boost or a goofy space car don't do much to dull the sense that you're not making meaningful progress each time you leave safety. It's quite unlike most survival games, where exploration is a key factor that rewards the curious or bold – exploring the wrong way in Breathedge mostly seems to end in sadness, death, and a reload if you don’t happen to find a new oxygen source. Considering that the autosave only kicks in at station entrances and exits, there’s a lot of potential to lose significant progress if you forget to use the manual save option. And when you have every upgrade and can finally explore at your leisure? Breathedge discards the oxygen concept entirely, along with the crafting and whatever pointless base you've built, shifting entirely out of the survival genre and into something more like an adventure game. That's right: The last 10 hours of the survival game that took me 25 hours total aren't a survival game at all. Arguably that’s a good thing, because Breathedge's survival elements don't manage to shake things up beyond the basics, but what comes after is worse. Instead of discovery, the second half relies entirely on plot to drive you forward. However, that plot is simple and linear, and the first two chapters take place in the sandbox survival environment, with two to six major things for you to explore and build. As the story goes on, it shifts to other environments and becomes completely linear, with its sandbox elements disappearing entirely in favor of constrained areas that play like a 3D adventure and are laid out like an FPS from 2005. Or, perhaps more accurately, a straight-line walking simulator – except sometimes you have to backtrack to a crafting station because your tool broke. It's a shame, because I wanted to like things about Breathedge. A lot of love went into the whimsical-yet-grim Soviet retrofuturism of its visual design, and enjoying its spooky stations, propaganda murals, or fictional pop culture is one of the best parts. It's an attempt at an extra-goofy, Russian version of Fallout mixed with Subnautica in space. Sometimes the jokes do land, like the many slapstick death poses you find other passengers in, the sci-fi parodies, or the silly designs of different ship components and other bits of the world. Riding a vacuum cleaner like a rocket motorcycle? That's funny. You poke dangerous things with your family heirloom – an immortal chicken – to disarm them, and it's hard not to enjoy the absurdity of that. But for every joke that hits, even more land flat. Your spacesuit's AI directs you around while constantly quipping, but it gets obnoxious fast and the joke writing is mostly terrible. It speaks so quickly I could barely catch the jokes without reading the subtitles, and the ones I did were often like a standup comedian doing a rolling, observational comedy routine, but delivered by the guy who reads the legal terms as quickly as he can at the end of pharmaceutical commercials. There are also some truly weak attempts at irreverent, provocative humor, like taking some dated-feeling jabs at cross-dressing. I'd say they might be funny to someone, but they're actually just… bad jokes. Adding insult to injury, if you die you get to hear all those same lines again the next time through. When that joke is a fourth wall-breaking meta-commentary about game developers making things hard or tedious to pad out the total gameplay time, it starts to feel less like a referential goof and more like an obnoxious lack of self-awareness. Breathedge may launch survival games into the final frontier, but it brings some of the worst tropes of the genre along with it… before abandoning that genre entirely in favor of a linear story propelled by hit-and-miss humor. It's all style over substance, looking great on the surface without much of interest underneath that polish. Without much sense of progression or accomplishment and exploration hampered by an obnoxious oxygen system, it relies too heavily on the initial novelty of floating around and the occasional decent joke. Breathedge just isn't fun to play. "
265,Maquette ,7.0, Just one look at last year’s mind-bending reveal trailer for Maquette and I was enthralled. Its recursive twist on a first-person puzzler is immediately exciting – and that’s saying something for a genre that’s seen portal guns, non-euclidian mazes, forced perspective wizardry, and plenty of other oddball ideas. But while Maquette has some undeniably clever tricks up its sleeve and is downright stunning to look at throughout, this brief story doesn’t ever really manage to surpass that initial sense of wonder. Maquette follows a person revisiting their memories of a past relationship, although it does so in fantastical, metaphorical environments through text written on the walls and the occasional cutesy conversation voiced by actual Hollywood couple Bryce Dallas Howard and Seth Gabel. All the while you’ll progress by solving mostly unrelated puzzles using Maquette’s big hook: a recursive world wrapped within infinite identical versions of itself.  In the center of each chapter’s contained puzzle area is a little model (a maquette, if you will) of the terrain around you. Drop an item – like a key or a bridge – into the model and a to-scale version will appear in the same spot behind you, only much larger – alternatively, pick something small out of the model and you’ll suddenly have a tiny version to use in your regular-sized world. It’s a phenomenally clever concept, and one that’s an absolute joy to mess around with when you’re first getting your bearings. Part of that immediate appeal is thanks to how jaw-droppingly gorgeous Maquette can be. Its use of vibrant colors and ornate, warped architecture is some of the most beautiful I’ve seen in any puzzle game. Those impressive aesthetics also extend into its otherworldly particle effects as objects phase in or out of place, as well as its top-notch audio design. Dropping a key into the model will make tiny jingling sounds as it bounces around, and that’s paired with deep, metallic clanks behind you from its larger counterpart. Walking through an abstract representation of a memory will be accompanied by the realistic bustle and sound effects of the actual place. But while its environments are stunning to both look at and listen to, I also found them oddly inert. There’s essentially nothing to interact with beyond the extremely limited set of items meant for solving puzzles, and it never felt rewarding to go off the beaten path or look around at stuff unrelated to the singular task at hand. The most glaring example of this is when you visit the memory of a county fair, which is full of booths with ring toss games, target shooting, and even a giant ferris wheel… all of which are immovable props you’re just meant to smile at and walk past. That’s not the biggest letdown ever, but it does undercut the life that’s been imbued into each area and makes the act of solving puzzles and interacting with this world feel almost entirely disjointed from the story being told. Thankfully the puzzles themselves can be very entertaining to solve, if not as exciting as I’d hoped Maquette’s recursive concept could be. There’s lots of tricky little solutions to find that I won’t spoil here, but I especially loved moments like the first time you leave your own “model” world and end up in the giant version of the one outside it (though Maquette could seriously use a sprint button to reduce the slow movement of those sections). Later chapters also bend the formula in interesting ways that, while generally slightly less successful than the central model idea, do offer some neat twists on its own setup. That said, compared to first-person puzzlers like Antichamber, Manifold Garden, and Portal, or even less deliberately mind-bending options like The Talos Principle or The Witness, Maquette’s recursive roadblocks are actually fairly simple to get through. The best puzzle games don’t just have clever puzzles, they make you feel clever yourself for solving them. Maquette only manages the first part of that in its brief, two- to three-hour playtime, with most of its solutions never really evolving past placing an object or two in the right spot and then walking to the next task (albeit with some novel, size-altering steps in between). That meant figuring them out usually made me go “oh” rather than “a-ha!” – a subtle distinction, but an important one when it comes to the mental reward of solving them. This may partly be because, unlike nearly all of the games I just listed, Maquette puts a larger focus on its story, at times turning more into a “walking simulator”-style adventure game than a brain-twisting puzzler. And while it tells that story well enough through attractive animations and succinct text, it’s a fairly basic look at the evolution of a relationship that feels largely unrelated to the magical world it’s being told within, held at arm’s length from most of what I was doing mechanically. It’s charming at times, sure, but not enough of a draw on its own – especially when you could just play Florence, also published by Annapurna Interactive, which is pretty much just a better version of the same story. Maquette is an incredibly clever and absolutely gorgeous first-person puzzle game, even if it doesn’t really push the boundaries of its own recursive concept in any particularly surprising ways. That left me feeling like its straightforward story and puzzles were a missed opportunity to do something more, but playing through Maquette’s brief adventure was at least a lovely, mind-tickling evening well spent.

266,Bravely Default 2 ,8.0, When it comes to JRPGs, I enjoy them as JRPG as possible: long, complex, and grindy. Seeing as Bravely Default 2 is about as JRPG as they come in 2021, I'm really into it. Its novel twists on traditional turn-based battle and job systems, the gorgeous watercolor art style of its many locations, and the sheer amount of game that’s crammed into such a tiny Switch cartridge is just what my old-school Final Fantasy-loving brain craves. The amount of grinding that it demands can be a tough hill to climb, but there are plenty of smart features in play that make those long repetitive stretches about as easy as they can be without losing the feeling of accomplishment.   Either way, Bravely Default 2’s roughly 60-hour story is like a refrigerator magnet poetry set of Square Enix cliches: you control a team of heroes out to save the world from calamity using magic elemental crystals – the group is even called The Heroes of Light, and you’re not just fighting evil, you're fighting the ultimate evil. I'm selling it a little bit short with that summary, because there are a few surprises I really enjoyed that diverge from its otherwise well-trodden JRPG trail, particularly near the end. But if you're picking this up expecting some deep storytelling, I'm here to dash those expectations against the same rocks our main hero's ship crashes into at the start of Bravely Default 2. (You know, where he washes ashore on a land in need of a hero? With only the vaguest recollection of how he got there?) And besides, while it might be a formulaic, light and breezy tale, that’s pretty much just what I want from a classic-style JRPG – especially one with such great gameplay mechanics underneath.   For example, it can be a literal lifesaver when three of your four party members lay defeated on the battlefield: rather than just raise one back with a Phoenix Down and hope they survive to the next round, I could Brave the turns I needed to raise them all at once, but only if I had been smart about banking turns with Default before then. Not only does striking that balance make me rethink tried-and-true turn-based tactics, it saves some battles from becoming frustrating. As is the case in most (maybe all?) JRPGs, certain bosses have moves that would otherwise end your run – but here that’s mitigated by the ability to get multiple party members back in the fight.  Bravely Default’s excellent job system also returns to add another layer of complexity to battles. Unlike a lot of RPGs, where each character is locked into a class from the outset, this job system lets you make them whatever you want, adding onto their abilities and strengths accordingly from each character's base stats. Characters gain job levels outside of normal experience points, and as you level them up you’ll unlock new abilities, including passive ones that can be assigned to that character regardless of their current job. These range from simple things like magical and physical buffs to more game-changing abilities like letting your magic attacks score critical hits as the Red Mage, or even the Monk's bare-knuckle combat ability that turns a character's fists into powerful weapons. Jobs from previous games, like White Mage, Thief, and Freelancer return, but (without spoiling anything) it’s a slight disappointment that there aren't as many jobs as in Bravely Second: End Layer, which had 30.        Even beyond that, there are other bosses to fight in Bravely Default 2's many optional sidequests (including a late-game quest with one of the most irritating boss fights I think I've ever experienced, though the frustration it caused was the exception rather than the rule). Both the sidequest bosses and the rare monsters reward you massively with experience, but the equipment they drop isn’t nearly as exciting. As great as the job system is, it sort of unsatisfyingly takes the place of equipment rather than adding another facet of character customization. There is no ultimate sword of everlasting holy light to excitedly discover; there are powerful weapons, that's for sure, but they never feel like they're impacting the way your characters might fight like they do in other RPGs. They're just kind of there because... how else can you fight a monster?   iframe allowautoplay="""" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/gallery/41464/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery41464"" scrolling=""no""> As great as the boss fights are, the dungeons leading up to them aren't nearly as notable. They're all quite pretty, but each one is essentially just a different take on a classic maze-like layout. I found myself getting turned around more than once, but not in a way that ever got frustrating or anything. It was always fairly easy to get myself on the right track, but thinking back after the fact, none of the dungeons have any unique mechanics or obstacles that could make them stand out from each other beyond one being set in a steampunk-inspired magician's laboratory and another being set in crystalline mine, for example.  The character and monster design, on the other hand, is less appealing. There's a plastic sheen to everyone and everything in the cutscenes and battles that looks a little off in a way I can't quite put my finger on. I loved the similar character style of the 3DS games, but that look hasn’t translated well for the Switch’s higher resolution and larger screen. As a result, they look out of place among the otherwise gorgeous watercolor backdrops. iframe allowautoplay="""" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/gallery/35961/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery35961"" scrolling=""no""> Meanwhile, the voice acting for Bravely Default 2 is great. I have no qualms with it whatsoever, other than the quips made during battles lack variety after just a few hours. You can also swap between English and Japanese at any time you're not in battle, which is a welcome touch. I played the majority of Bravely Default 2 with Japanese voiceover and English subtitles, because I find it easier to read through the text at my own pace when I don't understand the words being spoken. Plus I'm a huge dork.  If you're turned off by the thought of grinding experience in a JRPG, then Bravely Default 2 might be a hard sell for you – but for me, a fan of notoriously grindy classics like Final Fantasy 6 and the Dragon Quest DS ports, there was an almost relaxing delight to leveling up my party with battle after battle. (Many years ago I had basically written off my lifelong love affair with JRPGs because I’d lost patience for the grind, but when I started playing JRPGs on handhelds, oh baby did that change.) I spent some of my time with Bravely Default 2 grinding in handheld mode while watching YouTube videos or right before bedtime, making it feel like a positive time-waster rather than time wasted. But if you’re less inclined than I am to enjoy turning off your brain and watching the numbers go up, be warned that grinding is definitely required here.   I ran into a few bosses and dungeons where I was quickly defeated, often because I didn't have the right job leveled-up for the task at hand. Thankfully, Bravely Default 2 gives you abilities that make that easier as you progress. On top of passive abilities like the freelancer's ""JP Up,"" which gives you a boost to your earned job points and the option to turn battle speed up to a ludicrous four times the regular pace returns from the previous games. I got so used to playing at 4X speed that it would feel like time itself had slowed to a crawl whenever I dropped it back down during boss battles. Tools like this don’t eliminate the grind, but they do help ease the time investment leveling will take.   Another helpful system that seems like an attempt to fill the gap that the Switch’s lack of StreetPass has left involves sending a ship off to meet with other players while your system is asleep. You can let the ship sail for a maximum of 12 hours, and when you check on its progress you get a rundown of which other players it met on its journeys and which treasures it discovered. Many of the treasures are XP- or JP-boosting, so it's in your best interest to put your Switch to sleep once in a while. It's not as great as the StreetPass features of the earlier games because there's no way to summon those random strangers to help you out of a pinch, but I was really happy to see some sort of community integration carried forward into the Switch era. And the people you meet on your ocean voyages do eventually matter, but once again, the specifics fall into some spoilery territory. I also appreciated that you can swap between Easy, Normal, or Hard difficulty at any time if you run up against a tough battle or if grinding becomes so easy it’s boring. You don't even need to back out to the menu and restart, you can just decide ""I'm going to take it easy for a while"" and flip the setting over at will (not that I, a very manly gamer man, would ever do such a thing). While I stuck with Normal for nearly the entirety of my playthrough and found it to be pretty well balanced, I did test out the Easy against that annoying boss I mentioned earlier and it made a little bit of a difference without reducing it to a total cakewalk. It didn't appear to affect my XP and JP, either – so if you just want to play and enjoy an easier experience, who am I to judge? Bravely Default 2 is a long, familiar journey with excellent customizable combat and jobs systems that let you make your party and your playthrough truly your own. Its character and enemy art that was excellent on the 3DS doesn't translate all that well to the higher resolution of the Nintendo Switch, but the beautiful backdrops and environments get a massive boost from and look fantastic. And while the grind is real and repetitive fetch quests abound, it's so easy to pick up and put back down that it feels like less of a grind and more of a constructive way to kill some time. With plenty of old-school sensibilities and tons of improvements on the formula, Bravely Default 2 is almost everything I crave from a JRPG outside of a grand story. "
267,Curse of the Dead Gods ,9.0, I will admit that when I initially saw a top-down action roguelite called Curse of the Dead Gods, complete with swords, bows, environmental hazards, and semi-random rewards based on what room you choose to enter next, my first thought was “Hey, this seems a bit like a Hades knockoff.” It turns out, I was completely wrong. Despite featuring a smorgasbord of clear influences from other roguelites, Curse of the Dead Gods stands out in that increasingly crowded genre thanks to some cool new ideas of its own. Its curse and corruption mechanics add an extra strategic layer to its already excellent reflex-heavy hack-and-slash combat by forcing you to make tough and meaningful decisions at every step of every adventure it takes you on. Curse of the Dead Gods doesn’t do much in the way of storytelling, opting instead to simply throw you into a cursed temple, get out of your way, and let you read up on unlockable codex entries if you’re truly interested in learning more about its lore. It’s a bit of a bummer to see it pushed to the side considering the way Hades has recently raised the bar for storytelling in roguelites (and its art style’s similarity to Darkest Dungeon makes me long for a creepy baritone narrator), but the moment-to-moment gameplay of Curse of the Dead Gods is its true focus – and it’s so good that a thin plot is easily forgivable.  dir=""ltr"" All of the familiar roguelite mechanics that come with the territory are here: you fight your way through increasingly tough procedurally generated levels, collect new weapons and upgrades along the way, and when you reach the end (or die trying) you start your next run from scratch – except for permanently unlocked upgrades that make your next attempt just a little bit easier. But Curse of the Dead Gods does a number of interesting things to break from tradition. For one, instead of stacking all of its levels together, they’re divided into three different temples for you to attempt to conquer in turn, each with their own set of devious traps, brutal bosses, and bloodthirsty enemies – from the godforsaken electric babies in the Eagle Temple to the plague-bearing monstrosities of the Serpent Catacombs. Furthermore, instead of having you hopelessly attempt to beat a full temple right from the get-go, Curse of the Dead Gods eases you into its impressively challenging gauntlets by only giving you access to their first floors to start. Each floor is made up of just nine levels, including a boss battle at the end, and it’s only once you beat those first floors that you’re then able to challenge each temple’s second one – then the third after that, until finally you open up the true roguelite experience of trying to conquer the entirety of a temple in a single run. It’s a much more natural and forgiving difficulty curve that allows you to achieve small victories and have them mean something as opposed to just losing over and over again until you finally win. Those victories also reward you with a large amount of Crystal Skulls and Jade Rings, two currencies that allow you to purchase permanent upgrades that aid in subsequent, more difficult runs, and there’s no shortage of choices to be made here. Blessings can be bought with Crystal Skulls and provide you with various powerful buffs, like the ability to deal 50% more damage for six seconds if you kill three enemies in quick succession, or one that causes bosses to drop five pieces of loot instead of just two. You can also spend your Crystal Skulls to improve weapon altars which determine your starting loadouts, or extra Divine Favors, which allow you to re-roll the gear at any mid-run shop. Jade Rings, on the other hand, can be used to unlock new weapons so that they are added to the pool of ones that are allowed to appear on subsequent runs. That said, even though the unlockable weapons aren’t as exciting as they feel like they should be, the basic versions of the 10 different weapon classes are a ton of fun to use and have notable nuances that encourage different playstyles. Guns, for example, can interrupt enemies if you use their off-hand combo finisher in the middle of their attack; spears will always trigger critical hits if you land with just the tip of the weapon; claws can use their charged attack to dash behind an enemy and get out of the way of their attack; and shields can be used to bash enemies into spikes or other forms of environmental hazards.  Curse of the Dead Gods' combat is mechanically simple, but impressively deep. Its backbone is its unique approach to stamina; the stamina meter is segmented into five chunks, with dodges, finishers, sub weapon attacks, and heavy weapon attacks all costing a single stamina point to use. Once you’re out of stamina, you’ll have to wait about a second for it to start refilling again, which can feel like an eternity with how aggressive enemies tend to be. Crucially, though, there are other ways to restore it. Every time you kill an enemy, you gain a point back; whenever you perfectly time a dodge you’ll get a point back; and for the truly daring, if you time a parry to land just before an attack hits you’ll gain two points back, in addition to putting your attacker in a weakened state that causes your attacks to do more damage. That gives parries a really nice risk/reward balance. A good combat system isn’t worth much if the enemies don’t push you to engage with its depth, and fortunately Curse of the Dead Gods’ enemies are certainly up to the task. Most standard bad guys have pretty simple tells and give you plenty of time to react, but the stamina system can make even the basic baddies threatening if you exhaust yourself on offense and suddenly find you’re unable to dodge an incoming attack. To make matters worse, as you get deeper into the temple there are elite versions of enemies with more health and special attack properties. A regular archer might only fire one shot at you, but an elite version will fire three shots in quick succession that must be either parried or dodged. Add that great variety of enemies together with an assortment of environmental hazards that can be turned around and used in your favor, a dynamic lighting mechanic that strongly encourages you to think about whether you’re fighting in darkness or in light, a multiplier that increases the gold you gain if you kill quick and don’t take damage, and a ton of small nuances for each weapon (from sweet spots, to off-hand combo finishers, to charge attacks) and it’s easy to see that there is a lot to Curse of the Dead Gods’ combat. But even with so much going on, it never feels overwhelming and always stays satisfying to execute, which is a credit to how naturally these different mechanics blend together.  Appropriately, the biggest thing that sets Curse of the Dead Gods apart from so many other action roguelites are the actual curses of the actual dead gods. Alongside your life meter, there’s a corruption meter that fills whenever you enter a new room, take darkness damage, or decide to buy an item with a blood offering as opposed to paying gold. When the corruption bar fills up, you’ll be burdened with a random curse that ranges from only slightly bothersome effects like exploding barrels having a larger blast zone, to extremely annoying ones like enemies have a chance to explode and send out a damaging shockwave. These curses stay with you for the remainder of the run, up to a max of five at a time, and can only be removed as a reward for beating a boss. On their own, curses typically aren’t that bad, and sometimes they even have benefits that outweigh the negatives, such as one that puts traps on all treasure chests but also gives them a chance to drop two items instead of one. This tempted me in my earliest runs to just carelessly buy items with blood offerings whenever I couldn’t afford the gold price and accept curses left and right, which turned out to be a terrible idea because the fifth and final curse isn’t random. Instead, it’s basically a death sentence that causes your health to rapidly drop until it reaches 1 HP. Unless you’re confident in your ability to play without taking a single hit, you’ll want to avoid that one at all costs. Even beyond just the corruption meter and the curses, there’s a lot to think about before you even enter a level in Curse of the Dead Gods. Each level is tied to a specific reward, whether it be gold, a stat boosting relic, a new weapon, an upgrade to an existing weapon, or attribute points to your constitution (health), dexterity (damage), or perception (item discovery). Everything has a price, so I had to consider whether I should pass up a tangible reward in favor of collecting gold so I could afford the next shop, or whether I was able to spare the corruption cost of using a blood offering. It’s very strategic in ways that favorably brought to mind deck-building roguelikes such as Slay the Spire or Monster Train. It took me a little under 30 hours to beat the final boss for the first time, after which I unlocked a small handful of harder levels that I’m currently happily still working my way through. There’s not much of a reason to return to earlier levels outside of farming Crystal Skulls and Jade Rings in order to get 100% completion, but it’s worth mentioning that there are challenge runs that offer a ton of currency if you manage to beat their specially-themed temples but only give you one attempt to do so per day. One might take away your HUD and map while forcing you to play with a film grainy black and white filter so you never know what’s coming up next or how much life you have left, while another might flip the light/dark mechanic and make you more vulnerable while illuminated and more deadly while shrouded in darkness. They’re neat diversions and offer a nice taste of the full temple experience even while you’re still early on. Even without the curses themselves, Curse of the Dead Gods would be a standout roguelite with excellent combat, a smart structure that eases you into its difficulty, and a great variety of enemies, traps, and bosses across its three distinct temples. That strong foundation is only made better by the fun randomization curses bring to each run, on top of the added strategic element that comes with having to balance the need to gear up quickly with the fear of taking on more corruption than you can handle. Its between-run progression systems didn’t do much to hook me compared to the simple drive to best its hardest challenges, but even without that carrot on a stick, Curse of the Dead Gods is a blessing in disguise. "
268,Valheim Early Access ,9.0, Emerging from the mists to take the survival crafting genre by storm, much like the viking warriors it draws inspiration from, Valheim manages to spin a formula we've all seen plenty of times into something more like uncharted territory – even in Early Access. Whether I'm sailing the shimmering seas on my sturdy ship or delving deep into dim dungeons in search of treasure, the challenging combat, endearing art style, and moody soundtrack create a delightful and thrilling world to inhabit. It's guilty of becoming a bit grindy, especially later on, but the rewarding exploration and memorable encounters with its various dangers help give all that busywork meaning. Since even before Minecraft, we’ve done this opening routine countless times: by yourself or with up to nine friends, you cut down trees. You kill some animals. You make new tools so you can cut down trees and kill animals better. This makes it tricky, at first, to tease out why Valheim works so well and stands out so much from the dozens of other games like it. It's a lot of little, subtle things… and a few not so subtle.  The art and world design are definitely near the top of that list. It has a deliberately lo-fi look with pixelated textures and not a lot of polygons to go around. But even so, it's truly a beautiful game. Every creature, sunbeam, and forested hillside is filled with a sort of fairy tale ambience that made me want to get lost in its procedurally-generated regions. And there's a lot to get lost in, from peaceful meadows to spooky, monster-infested woods to snowy mountains. Every time I generated a new map it impressed me with its scale and how it looked like it could’ve been hand-made. Because of the naturalistic, Northern European feel, it comes across as very cohesive and authentic. The first time Valheim really made me go ""Wow!"" was when, after about 15 hours of preparing, I set sail on my own hand-built ship. Like a proper viking, your main method of long-distance travel will be taking to the seas and riverways. The controls for steering are kind of clunky, and I love them for that very reason. Mastering the art of making tight turns, plotting a course through dangerous rapids, and managing my speed was oh so satisfying, even if it included some trial and error that did a number on my hull. By the time I had mastered the muscle memory to approach the shoreline at full speed and basically drift to a complete stop, parallel to the beach, right where I wanted to be, I felt like a true master of the briny deep. Realistic waves can bounce you up and down, and a sudden storm can even damage your vessel and force you to make for a safe harbor. The ever-changing direction of the wind is a constant consideration that may encourage you to go out of your way and discover something new rather than simply sail in a straight line. Having a ship makes it feel like a whole new world is opening up – and then it tries to eat you. Sometimes literally, as the deeper waters are full of danger.  Valheim's larger monsters are very well designed in their simplicity. My first time encountering a troll was a memorable and terrifying experience. Some of my most exciting adventures arose simply from trying to figure out how to get from A to B without being smashed into jam. To reach the second boss arena, because of the way my world was generated, I had to sail up an extremely narrow river that ran between two frigid mountain biomes, which caused me to take constant damage from frostbite. Unfortunately, at the very coldest part of the canyon, I discovered the waterway actually became too narrow for my ship. I leapt out, the winter air chipping at my health bar, and frantically whacked away at the voxel rocks of the riverbed trying to make a canal wide enough to let me pass. And then, from the steep canyon walls above, a troll showed up and smashed my boat to flinders. I had to flee in terror, shivering in my soggy boots, return to my camp on foot (which involved spending a danger-filled night in the wilderness since it was so far away), build a new ship, come back, deal with the troll, finish my canal, and get on my way before I froze solid. None of that was scripted, but Valheim's simple but brilliant world generation made it one of the most memorable experiences I've had in any survival game in a long while – and it's far from the only tale I have like it! This is an ecosystem that consistently generates campfire-worthy stories with a small number of ingredients. There are finished games that feel less fleshed-out and well balanced. If you hadn't told me it was early access, I probably never would have suspected anything. Some of those ingredients are better than others, of course. The nearly-ubiquitous Greydwarves of the Black Forest are an unchallenging annoyance, like flies you have to constantly swat away. I would have liked to snap my fingers and see maybe half of them deleted from existence. Unfortunately, I haven't found any magic space rocks for my gauntlet just yet. On the other end of that spectrum are the satisfying, hectic, dramatic boss fights that drive Valheim's progression. These really demonstrate the strengths of its combat: There are five in this early access version, out of a planned nine, and I've taken on four of them in the 40-plus hours I've played so far. Not only do they serve as a climactic capstone to each area and tier of technology, they're really enjoyable and rewardingly difficult to defeat. Each is a major step up in challenge from the last, and the third and fourth bosses feel almost absurd to take on solo. Definitely plan to bring some backup and you’ll have a much better time. The randomized dungeons are also a treat, from bone-strewn viking barrows that reminded me of Skyrim to foreboding crypts that bring to mind the undead areas of the original Dark Souls. You'll need a torch to navigate them, and they're full of monsters, treasure, and crafting materials that you can't get in the overworld. Each one is a nice little break from the sometimes tedious tasks you'd be doing above ground.  As with most survival crafting games, Valheim can get a bit grindy – sometimes extremely grindy, in fact. Harvesting enough ore or metal scraps to get a new set of gear can literally take real-world days. Some later areas require certain consumables, like poison or frost resistance mead, to even survive in them, meaning you have to do a lot of collecting and brewing every time you want to visit. This cuts both ways, because it serves to make them feel more thrilling and dangerous, but also adds a layer of ticking-clock anxiety and a lot of repetitive prep work to exploration as you watch your mead supply dwindle. Not being able to access a new area because I needed to get stronger to beat up a troll is cool. Not being able to access a new area because I'm waiting on my bees to make more honey? Not so much. Work faster, stupid bees! I really like the way other consumables tie into progression, though. While you can skill up in different weapons and abilities, like running and swimming, your health and stamina meters are completely tied to what's in your belly. This means that ""leveling up"" mostly involves finding new ingredients and learning new recipes to ensure you're always as well fed as you can be. Valheim also wants you to eat a balanced diet. You can benefit from up to three types of food at any time, but stacking more than one of the same thing gives you no benefit. This is really one of Valheim's most clever little tricks for making your character feel more alive and connected to the world, and it sets itself apart from the rote, old-fashioned RPG progression routines where experience translates to levels, which translate into more hit points and energy. There's something really satisfying and thematically appropriate about heading out to battle evil with a full stomach, a good night's rest, and a flagon full of invigorating mead to quaff. And it also avoids one of the most annoying things about hunger systems in other games: being hungry will never actually kill you or prevent you from being able to hunt and gather. You just won't want to go into battle with anything stronger than a skeleton on an empty stomach. Building your own viking village can be a decent way to while away the hours while you wait for those bees. While Valheim is voxel-based, it's also much more limited in how much effect you can have on the terrain than something like Minecraft. You can raise and lower the terrain a certain amount, but it's not very precise. The tool for leveling out an area for building was especially unsatisfying to use, as I never seemed to be able to get a nice, even grade no matter how much I fiddled with it. That means all of my buildings were either floating partly above the ground, or the dirt below would clip through the floorboards in some places. Other than that, the structures you can build are cozy and appropriately Norse. They're assembled from a collection of pre-made pieces that limit your stylistic freedom somewhat, but also make sure the things you build really look like they belong in this world. When you move on to bigger projects, you even have to start thinking about support beams and load-bearing walls, which was a welcome little touch of immersion. Whether I'm fighting for my life, plundering forgotten barrows, or just watching the sun play across the water in a calm moment of respite, Valheim has created a world I'm consistently joyful to live in and discover more of. It’s definitely a traditional survival game at heart, which means the further in you get, the more you have to put up with some tedious grinding before you can get back to the good parts. But even at its early access launch, those good parts are already very good, especially when you get to take to the seas or test your skill against its imposing bosses. And the simple but exceptional art and music create a strong sense of place in which to do it all. Grab some mead and come join me by the fire. I don't think you'll be disappointed. "
269,Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury ,7.0, Sandwiched between the sublime planet hopping of Super Mario Galaxy and the absurdist delights of Super Mario Odyssey, Mario’s Wii U outings are very much the black sheep – or perhaps more appropriately, the colourful cats – of the franchise. They’re getting another shot, however. First, New Super Mario Bros. U returned in a deluxe 2019 re-release, and now it’s Super Mario 3D World’s turn. And better still, the already decent-sized Wii U adventure is bolstered by an entirely new outing: Bowser’s Fury. Both parts of the package certainly have their moments – and Bowser’s Fury in particular has a pretty interesting central hook – but by the time I was finished I still had an itch that Mario’s cat suit didn’t quite scratch.   Back in 2013, IGN’s reviewer praised Super Mario 3D World for being a joy to play, both in single player and with friends. Many of the points made in that review very much still stand, in particular the entertainment value from the fact that each level is typically built around a unique gameplay twist. Much like the Galaxy games, this has allowed Nintendo’s designers to flit nimbly from idea to idea. In one level platforms appear and disappear in time to music. In another, players use the gyro functionality to activate blocks themselves. There are levels with all sorts of fun concepts – playing in silhouette, walking on invisible tiles, steering through mazes of Futurama-style pipes, and navigating paths with panels that flip each time you jump. There’s even a level that pays homage to Super Mario Kart, complete with music straight from the SNES classic.  Power-ups add to the variety, giving Mario a cannon on his head, or allowing him to be cloned and tasking players with wrangling several of the portly plumber at once. Levels generally contain standalone micro-challenges too – short, single room set pieces that are one and done. And as is so often the way, Super Mario 3D World’s true scope - its full set of Worlds - doesn’t become apparent until well after you’ve “beaten” the game. The visual design is also still a highlight. The environments are wonderfully vibrant, from the way shrubs and flowers bop along to the jaunty melodies that are apparently piped into each area, through to the impressive amount of variety between worlds. The suite of cat suit animations are also just so lovingly composed. Mario doesn’t need to wiggle his bum before he pounces, for instance, but the move is so much the better for that small detail, and that's just one of many.  That said, playing Super Mario 3D World again now, the gameplay actually feels like a bit of an awkward fit for the presentation. Levels are viewed from fixed perspectives (that can often be shifted left or right) and generally have limited depth, giving you a path to follow but only so much room to move within it. This has a few unfortunate knock-on effects. Despite sharing some design principles with Super Mario Galaxy, for instance, 3D World feels a lot more staid. Of course, there’s a pretty big difference between Mario running all the way around planetoids and the levels here, in which he’s basically trapped in a set perspective diorama, but 3D World’s presentation means that even transitions lack the dynamism and excitement that naturally come hand in hand with galaxy-hopping. To get from one playspace to another in the Galaxy games, for instance, you literally rocket off the surface of the world you’re on and zoom through space, spinning and twirling and collecting Star Bits as you go. In 3D World you, erm, go into a box… and then come out of a box in a different place. At best you fly slowly through a glass pipe. It just doesn't feel as effervescent as Mario's most freewheeling outings. Of course, the designers have tried to think outside the presentational box in a few different ways. The introduction of the cat suit is perhaps the most notable, as it lets players scale walls, reinventing the playspace and revealing secrets or unseen paths that were previously out of sight. Heck, you can even run right up the flagpole at the end of each course. It’s a liberating inclusion, expanding your possibilities in ways that throwing fireballs and boomerangs or swiping enemies with your tanooki tail doesn’t. Other power-ups also transform traversal, whether you’re soaring up into the sky using a Propeller Box or stomping through the scenery after chomping down on a Mega Mushroom. Even so, I just don’t enjoy Super Mario 3D World’s gameplay as much as other entries in the series, and I think that has a lot to do with this game’s heritage. The foundation of this design was born in Super Mario 3D Land for 3DS, after all, and in that context it excelled. The constrained scope of levels suited handheld play and the limits of the hardware well, while the set perspective and movement restrictions gave Nintendo’s designers the perfect diorama-like design to showcase the system’s 3D screen. It worked wonderfully. On console, it’s a rather different story. Without the depth perception enabled by a 3D screen, the forced viewpoint makes spatial awareness harder to judge than it would be in a purely 2D design or in a 3D game with full camera control. As such, 3D World doesn’t feel as intuitively precise as other Mario games.  This feeling is compounded when you throw additional players into the mix. Yes, just like the New Super Mario Bros. games for Wii, Wii U, and Switch, up to four people can quest together – in this case choosing from Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad and eventually, Rosalina. The result is chaotic and fun, but also haphazard; some levels and challenges simply don’t work that well with four people running around in them. Multiplayer is a mixed bag in other ways, too. The core of the experience is meant to be a push and pull between cooperation and competition. On one hand you’re working together to get to the end of the stage but, on the other, you’re also fighting to get the most points and win the crown… that you then get to wear in the next level. This tension can be fantastic – one minute I’d leave a power-up for a friend to help them out, the next I’d pick them up and try to toss them off the map.  One of the places where it fails, however, is when the shared pool of lives runs out and prematurely ends the fun. Why have lives at all? As long as one player remains on solid ground then why can’t we keep trying to bumble our way through a level? That would suit the random, anarchic-feeling gameplay a whole lot more, and it would also mean that less experienced players aren’t punishing the whole team if they die over and over. The differences between playable characters is more of a negative than a positive, too. It’s rare that you’d want to use Toad, for instance, who is fast but can't jump very high. Luigi, too, can be tricky if there’s a lot going on, as you need to judge both his larger jump and the fact that he skids to a stop. Rosalina, on the other hand, is just broadly better. Not only does she have a spin attack out of the gate, but she can basically double jump. Yes, she’s the slowest and yes, she’s the only character to lose her core abilities when she’s wearing a suit, but still, she’s always the first draft pick. The solution to this would be to simply let multiple people use the same character and then put them in different colours, but that’s not an option. Of course, the deeper solution is to have levels designed specifically for multiplayer outside the main storyline. That’s perhaps too much to ask for a re-release like this, but it’s disappointing no improvements were made at all. Even the scoring system, in which whoever gets to the top of the flagpole basically insta-wins, is unchanged. Instead, the main change to multiplayer is the introduction of online play, which I wasn’t able to test ahead of release. And to be honest, if I was going to play this again with other people, I’d want to be in the same room, anyway. Playing with friends is still fun for a change of pace, but 3D World’s levels feel much more appropriate for one – or possibly two – players. I mostly played it solo and for the most part stuck with Ol’ Reliable, Mario, then Rosalina once I’d unlocked her. There isn’t a great deal of impetus to use the other characters beyond curiosity and obtaining the occasional character-specific stamp. Speaking of the stamp system, it’s been integrated with the game’s new Snapshot mode. This will be familiar to anyone who’s played Super Mario Odyssey, and lets you pull up a camera-style interface, then zoom, pan, and switch filters to get your shot just right. The addition of stamps into the mix is a great concept, but works a lot better in Bowser’s Fury, in which you can more easily frame a scene. In 3D World you’ll often not be able to move the camera at all. It’s also a little disappointing that you can only rotate stamps, not flip them to face the other way or adjust their size. There’s quite a low limit on how many stamps you can have on screen at once, too. Snapshot mode is a good addition, but I would have liked to see Nintendo make some single player quality of life changes too. Player lives feel really anachronistic at this point, for instance, and only get in the way of actually enjoying the game. Structurally, their purpose is to force you to restart a level from the beginning if you run out of lives, as opposed to from the checkpoint, but the upshot of this system is that I’d deliberately kill Mario to get back to five lives (not nine, curiously) instead of starting a new level with only one or two lives, just to avoid the possibility of losing checkpoint progress. That doesn’t seem like the kind of player behaviour Nintendo would want. There’s no good reason not to have infinite restarts from the mid-level checkpoint, either, as getting to the end of a course generally isn’t meant to be the biggest challenge – it’s finding all three Green Stars and the stamp. Then again, maybe Nintendo’s designers would make the argument that hitting the Game Over screen refreshes the slot machines (which essentially grant extra lives) and the Toad Houses (which let players stock up on power-ups) in the overworld. Sure, but all that shlepping around is just unnecessary busywork, and the Toad Houses in particular feel like a misstep in the first place. Not only is there a fear of wasting what you get from these houses given they won’t reset very often, they highlight how much more fun – and challenging – 3D World could have been with a deterministic loadout system. The way it currently works is you’ll go into a level in whatever state you finished the last level. If you happened to be mini-Mario, for instance, have fun, because you’re starting the new level as mini-Mario (and for the record, there’s no other instance in which this happens – in all other circumstances you start as regular-sized Mario). Alternatively, if you happened to finish the last level in the cat suit, with a tanooki suit in reserve, well, aside from having extra movement and combat options, you can also take a bunch more hits in the next course. I understand that the designers want you to roll with whatever you’ve got, and also that they’ll provide appropriate power-ups within each level (although, if you’re mini-Mario, enjoy the mushroom in place of something better), but rather than it being a fun test of skill, it instead feels punitive.  I can’t help but imagine a (3D) world in which you can choose your loadout before every level. Each slice of gameplay would start on an even playing field, and experimenting with different suits could be part of the challenge, and even tie into getting specific collectables. In essence this is how Bowser’s Fury works – you build up a stockpile of power-ups and can basically switch between them at will. It’s much more fun. I also would have liked to see Nintendo take inspiration from Super Mario Odyssey’s assist functionality. With that option on, kids could find their platforming feet, secure in the knowledge that if they fall into the abyss the game will just pop them back up onto solid ground. 3D World has an Invincible Super Leaf pickup which appears once you’ve failed a level enough times, but this only protects players from enemies, not from falling to death… which is the bigger hurdle on a lot of courses. A change to this would have been great for beginners and made a huge difference to multiplayer too. As it stands, Super Mario 3D World has some great levels and challenges, but I don’t think it fully succeeds as either a single player or multiplayer game, and it’s a real shame Nintendo didn’t take this re-release as its chance to address the elements that create friction throughout the game design.  So that’s one half of the package. The other is Bowser’s Fury, a whole new, much more contemporary-feeling adventure. Gone is the concept of lives, and the fixed perspective, replaced by an open world with full camera control. The other playable characters have also been jettisoned, but Mario is joined by Bowser Jr. and together they’re trying to save the new setting of Lake Lapcat from a malevolent black goop that has taken hold of the Koopa King. The most significant mechanic tied to this setup is that every few minutes Bowser explodes with fury, sending the world into an apocalyptic storm in which glowing blocks drop from the sky and his towering form breathes sweeping jets of fire, decimating anything in their path – occasionally including the frame rate. This rage state will subside in a few minutes, but can also be overcome by directly confronting Bowser or by reaching a Cat Shine – the game’s main collectable. Most of these are found at the lighthouses dotted about the world. After the Lake reverts to sunshine and blue skies, Bowser settles back down into the muck, but soon begins to slowly rise up, giving you a visual indication of how close he is to unleashing his fury once again. It’s an interesting mechanic given that we’re accustomed to open worlds that largely let us set our own pace and agenda. Here, however, Bowser’s Fury is unleashed so regularly that you have to be ready to deal with it at almost any time. It’s not always welcome – occasionally ruining whatever you were doing – but can be used to your advantage. Blocks with Bowser’s face on them can only be destroyed by his furious fire breath, for instance, while the blocks that drop from the sky can actually make platforming challenges easier in the midst of the maelstrom. It’s quite cool seeing how the world is reinvented whenever Bowser blows his top. That said, I did get a little tired of the constant interruptions, and if you’re not within easy reach of a Shine, it quickly becomes apparent that fighting Bowser is an extremely repetitive way to restore the world. This battle is heavy on Godzilla vibes but extremely light on excitement and gameplay. It doesn’t evolve much over the course of Bowser’s Fury, either, and is really just the icing on a pretty half-baked cake as far as bosses are concerned. In 3D World in particular they’re about as gripping as a book written entirely in Lorem Ipsum. King Koopa’s role may be a mixed blessing in Bowser’s Fury, but Bowser Jr. is absolutely a net positive. Younger players can set him to help them by taking out enemies and collecting coins, while purists can turn that off altogether, only using Bowser Jr. when they direct him using the gyro functionality. His main abilities are interacting with question mark walls and being Mario’s power-up caddy. It’s this latter function that really elevates Bowser’s Fury, as it lets you stockpile power-ups and call on him to deliver specific suits as you need them. It turns bonus abilities into tools you can experiment with and use as you see fit, and is much more player friendly than the system in 3D World. Each lighthouse on Lake Lapcat plays host to five Shines, and the layout around each location changes depending on the Shine you’re gunning for. It’s a familiar system, but a good way to pack more gameplay into a small area. The moment to moment action, however, doesn’t contain too many surprises; you’ll be using the same power-ups and suits from 3D World, and a number of challenge types are repeated across the archipelago. That said, the world steadily opens up as you make progress, so there are always new locations or edges of the map to explore. Getting around is good fun, too, thanks to the ability to hitch a ride with the dinosaur Plessie any time you’re near water. Which is all the time.  I enjoyed my time with Bowser’s Fury but it ultimately doesn’t feel that essential. This is a Mario title driven more by gimmicks than gameplay. There’s no better example of this than the fact that almost every single creature, enemy, and object in Lake Lapcat is part cat. Goombas are furry, with cat ears and tails. Flowers are shaped like paws and shrubs have cat ears. It’s all extremely silly, and I’ll be the first to admit that it does give the game a fun flavour, but it doesn’t add anything in terms of gameplay, and that’s surprising. The best Mario games take their goofy ideas and tie them into core mechanics that directly impact puzzles and platforming. Here, it’s largely window dressing. Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury packs a tonne of engaging gameplay, but neither component comes together as elegantly as it might have done. This is a solid option if you’re craving more Super Mario for your Switch, but it’s not the moustachioed must-play I was hoping for. "
270,Little Nightmares 2 ,7.0, Horrors lurk around every corner in Little Nightmares 2’s sinister city setting. This deadly game of hide and seek picks up where the original left off, this time with an entirely new set of twisted tormentors hunting you through a variety of dread-inducing locations. It’s a formula that works, and Little Nightmares 2 certainly has its fair share of exhilarating moments over the course of its fleeting, four-hour duration, but it also plays things a little safe, utilising many of the original’s puzzle-solving and stealth mechanics. Instead of being a shocking new horror, Little Nightmares 2’s stalk through the shadows ultimately proves to be somewhat of a retread. dir=""ltr""    It’s admittedly quite adorable the way Six will occasionally mimic Mono’s actions; when he picks up an important puzzle item, she’ll often scoop up a wooden building block and amble along behind him, shadowing him like a younger sibling. But much like a little sister, Six also often finds herself getting in the way, stubbornly standing still to block your path while you’re dragging a piece of furniture, or accidentally nudging you out of cover when you’re trying to remain hidden from the watchful gaze of a wide-eyed warden. While Six’s inclusion eventually has a surprising story pay-off late in Little Nightmares 2 — in a way I won’t spoil here — her presence feels largely underutilised for the bulk of the adventure. It also breaks the immersion somewhat that Mono is so easily spotted the moment he sets foot outside of the shadows, yet Six can seemingly stumble around in the spotlight right under an enemy’s nose and attract about as much attention as a broken television set. Speaking of which, busted boob tubes are found littered along your path through Little Nightmares 2’s gloomy narrative, which appears to be a sardonic commentary on the screen obsession of modern society. This leads to some hilariously dark moments later on when, after Mono has picked up a discarded TV remote, he’s able to toggle these goggleboxes on and off to draw the focus of certain enemy types and lure them to their death like media-loving lemmings. dir=""ltr""  How you avoid these hulking towers of terror, however, is by relying on mostly the same simple stealth techniques established in the original; crouch-walking to quieten your footsteps and scurrying between the shadowy undersides of tables during the short windows in which their gaze is averted. One stand-out section of Little Nightmares 2 satisfyingly strays from the norm by giving Mono a torch that freezes prosthetic-limbed hospital patients in place anytime they’re caught in its beam. It’s a startling effect to watch them shift from inanimate statues in the light to shuffling silhouettes in the dark as you quickly whip the torch around to halt their approach from all angles, and I wish there were a few more interesting departures like this along the way. Little Nightmares 2 is every bit as black, bleak, and eerily beautiful as the original. It’s also just as brief, and although the reintroduction of the Six character as an AI-controlled co-op partner ultimately serves the story well, she’s not used as a vehicle to take the game’s puzzle-solving and stealth to interesting new places, which seems like a real missed opportunity. While I still very much enjoyed each thrilling encounter with its menacing mob of monstrosities, the overall sense of familiarity this time around meant that Little Nightmares 2 left less of a lasting impact. There’s no doubting developer Tarsier Studios’ artistry and ability, but I hope for its next project it leaves these Little Nightmares behind and dares to dream bigger. "
271,Destruction AllStars ,6.0,"Smashing cars into one another is a long-standing institution in video games. From age-old favourites like Burnout and Flatout to more modern entries like Wreckfest, there’s always been that drive to ram steel into steel and blow our opponents into tiny bits of scrap. With PlayStation 5 (and PlayStation Plus) exclusive Destruction AllStars, developer Lucid Games attempts to combine that classic demolition appeal with ideas from contemporaries such as Rocket League, Fortnite, and Overwatch. The result is a competitive car combat game that can have fun bursts of frantic action, but never adds up to much more than that. The crux of Destruction AllStars is a simple one: drive fast and hit hard. This is often extremely satisfying to do as well, because it makes it easy to push down on the accelerator, line up your target, and then flick the right stick forward to slam into an opposing vehicle. The harder you hit the other car, the more points you’ll get: one point for a light hit, two for a medium one, etc. This scoring system works well as the basis for most of the four modes (more on those later), keeping things for the most part nice and simple when there is so much going on elsewhere on screen, not least the collisions constantly taking place around the gorgeous looking arenas.  Shamelessly arcadey in its handling, the driving itself is slick and responsive, with different sizes of vehicle feeling appropriately different to maneuver and a tap of the handbrake letting you effortlessly drift around corners to evade chasing cars. The trick in Destruction AllStars is to always be on the move, both so you have the momentum to get higher-scoring hits and so you aren’t a sitting duck for others trying to do the same to you. And that doesn’t only apply to when you’re behind the wheel, but when you’re outside of your car, too. This is what separates AllStars from most car combat games: the ability to bail out and move around the arena on foot. At its best, this means ejecting yourself from a car before it explodes, flying into the air, and then landing straight into another vehicle, which feels sensational – reminiscent of launching yourself out of the Batmobile in Batman: Arkham Knight. At its worst, however, you’re left running and jumping around in search of a new vehicle while all of the fun is had around you far faster than you can keep up with. The light parkour platforming itself isn’t unenjoyable, thanks in part to wall-running that’s smooth and nimble. It’s just how utterly powerless you feel in comparison to when you’re in a car that’s the problem.   “Of course you shouldn’t be as powerful as a car when on foot,” I hear you shouting, and you’re not wrong. It makes sense that a human (albeit one with semi-superhuman capabilities) can’t stand toe-to-toe with a hulking piece of 100mph metal, but AllStars sets the wrong expectation by giving you the ability to barge opponents with melee attacks and summon glowing Wolverine-like blades from your hands if you’re Bluefang that sure look like they should do more than scratch the paint. With all of that available you just expect to have more opportunities to use your powers in fun ways, but you can’t really. It’s just one example of where AllStars seems a bit confused as to what it wants to be.  More important than their personalities are the abilities that accompany each AllStar: one when they’re on foot and one when they’re in command of their hero vehicle. The on-foot powers, called Breakers, are triggered by hitting R1 and are often echoes of the hero vehicle abilities but on a much smaller scale, making them largely ineffective. This can range from Shyft’s invisibility to dropping parcels for opponents to trip over as Boxtop. But across the roster, I felt very little impact when using a Breaker, and found their biggest value was the speed boost and double-jump you get when triggering them because those actually make it easier to reach a new vehicle and become relevant to the match again. As is the case throughout Destruction AllStars, abilities get a lot more interesting once you’re back behind the wheel. After filling up the hero meter over time and boosting that process by collecting shards littered around the arena you can summon your signature vehicle, at which point a lot of fun can be had. These cars’ abilities can be used to devastating effect, and doing so well can often be the difference between winning and losing. They range from the hedgehog-like metal spikes that can jut out of Jian’s car and defend them stoutly to Sgt. Rescue’s smoke bombs that trail him in his wake, hindering opponents’ vision.   In particular, my favourites so far have been the wolf-themed Lupita, whose sleek car leaves a trail of flames in her wake to damage any driver that runs through them, and Bluefang, who has a burly ride with giant rotating saws on the front that shred anything in its path. I think we can all agree that carving through opponents like they’re made out of papier-mâché while donning a tiger head and leather jacket is a fun time. Anecdotally, it seems fairly well balanced – it’s still very early days balance-wise, and I have been seeing Bluefang frequent the winners podium more than most, but plenty of different characters appear on the victory screen alongside him. The other (less enjoyable) free-for-all mode is Gridfall, a cross-between sumo wrestling and Fall Guys’ Hex-A-Gone round. Drivers tussle to become the last car standing as sections of the arena floor disappear and beckon you into the depths. I found it hard to have fun consistently since you’ll either fall unceremoniously early or survive long enough to see the action diluted down to a cagey game of cat and mouse towards the end of each match. This mode requires a more deliberate approach to driving and rewards defensive play more than any other, making it feel at odds with the fast and furious nature of AllStars as a whole.   More in keeping with Mayhem’s mood is the 8v8 Carnado mode, essentially a team-based equivalent with the addition of a 100-foot-tall tornado in the centre of the stadium. You still score points by wrecking enemies, but then have to bank them by driving into the vortex before your car is destroyed by an opponent. It’s fun to play with friends, but lacks any form of real teamwork. It feels like a missed opportunity not to do what other hero-based games like Overwatch do in creating opportunities to let you combine ultimate abilities together for even greater results. For example, having a driver that possessed an ability similar to Zarya’s Graviton Surge that pulls enemies together into the same spot could combine with Bluefang’s Shredder to create highly rewarding moments of play, but they’re all much more independent than that. The fourth and currently final team-based mode is Stockpile, and unfortunately it’s one I struggled to enjoy at all. Once again you smash into cars, but this time that causes glowing gears to appear on the floor which you must then collect on foot before depositing them in one of three banks around the map. In order to bank these points you must again be on foot and not in your vehicle, which just isn’t fun. It’s bizarre to me that this mode forces you out of your car so much. I guess Lucid Games didn’t learn the lessons taught from Tony Hawk’s Underground, where it was proven conclusively that not being on your wheels is not what people want. This isn’t the most baffling design decision that appears to have been made, though. Despite there being 8v8 modes, you can only play in a party up to four players in size – but not only that, you can’t play any of the free-for-all modes with friends at all. This seems like a huge miss as I could see myself having a great time crashing into my pals in the Mayhem mode, delivering a healthy amount of schadenfreude as most great party games do. These restrictive options, combined with a lack of any local multiplayer, makes the experience of playing with friends a shallow one.    Lucid knows what it’s doing here, and it’s not great, even if the game is effectively free if you own PS Plus. A similar thing can be said for the premium cosmetics available, which also cost 600 apiece plus a hefty amount of the other currency that you earn solely in-game.    AllStars does take advantage of the power of the PS5 to good effect though. The visuals are shiny and sharp throughout with loading times kept to a minimum. It also implements some of the best use of the DualSense’s haptic feedback that I’ve experienced to date, especially when the health of your car gets low and you feel the axles become loose and fragile in the palms of your hands. Destruction AllStars can provide short bursts of action-packed chaos that are at their most fun when kept simple. The driving and vehicle-to-vehicle combat are highly enjoyable when you’re slamming into other cars at high speed, but they wear thin quickly and offer very little else on closer inspection and the on-foot gameplay you’re forced into too often feels pointless. With hit-and-miss modes, single-player content hidden behind a paywall, and poor cosmetics on offer, there’s a disappointing lack of depth beneath the loud crashes, bangs, and wallops that feel so exciting at first. The roster of heroes are decently designed, along with their signature abilities, but very little is done to encourage team play or interesting uses of them. There’s the basis of a great party game here too, but at launch it's far too shallow an experience for Destruction AllStars to be considered one right now. "
272,Blue Fire ,8.0, Few things are more important to a 3D action platformer than having movement that’s both fun and responsive, and Blue Fire takes that fact to heart. Its assortment of agile abilities not only look great in action, but also offer the kind of precise control needed to overcome its demanding enemies and obstacles alike. While there’s a bit too much reliance on retreading familiar ground by the end, its array of treacherous yet addicting challenge rooms had me happily running, jumping, and dashing through them again and again. At first glance, Blue Fire bears resemblance to what Hollow Knight might be reimagined in a 3D space. It’s got plenty of familiar ideas: quickly dashing between platforms in an all-but-abandoned kingdom full of dark monsters, piecing together your mysterious tiny warrior’s purpose in the world, and striking at foes while bouncing off their head with repeated aerial slashes. The few scattered survivors that aren’t trying to kill you will often have small tasks to undertake instead – quests that are actually tracked in your log, which is something I’ve always wished for in games with sprawling worlds like this one. You can even find and equip Spirits (Blue Fire’s take on Hollow Knight’s Charms) to modify and enhance your abilities to a near-ridiculous degree.  And yet, developer Robi Studios has built Blue Fire’s platforming mechanics in a way that feels tailored for 3D space, with a level of control that nearly always left me with no one to blame but myself whenever I met my demise. Your character’s quick mid-air dashes can be lengthened or stopped short at will, and lock-on targeting allows you to dash towards or away from foes at any angle. The inclusion of a small stamina bar for wall-running and jumping is a godsend when learning the limits of your parkour abilities, as most all surfaces are applicable - including weaving around pillars to jump at different angles. You’re only able to utilize one dash and double jump (unless you equip the right Spirits) each time you take to the air, which turns every platforming segment into a series of calculated decisions. Every area, every challenge room, and every boss fight makes clever use of its terrain (or lack thereof), pushing you to experiment with your platforming powers and figure out how to best come out on top. Certain encounters can line spikes along the walls to stop you from parkour past enemies, or limit your time on the ground with deadly shockwaves and hazards to make sure you’re constantly in motion to find relative safety.  When you aren’t dodging spike traps or pits full of corrupted ooze, you’ll be strafing and zipping around shadowy creatures looking to tear you to pieces. With short combo attacks both on ground and in the air, your character can slice and dice with dual swords that can be swapped out for upgrades as you explore - but don’t expect to be able to take many hits in return. You’re only able to block attacks with the help of a shield spell that drains fairly fast - and also shares a mana pool with a quick and lightweight ranged fireball spell, so the best defense usually turns out to be moving quickly to avoid getting hit altogether. Fighting these enemies also let me incorporate movement abilities in interesting ways. I could dash circles around sword swiping foes, or refill my midair dash and jumps by striking them from the sky, turning my diminutive fighter into a very agile and angry hornet. Fights never become crushingly difficult, but Blue Fire’s protagonist is remarkably squishy – so much so that even using a shield spell to guard melee attacks would knock me backward several feet, frequently sending me skidding off the narrow platforms I was fighting on. The impact of these attacks resulted in a comedic Looney Tunes moment of frantically dashing back into the fight before gravity kicked in. This might not have even worked were it not for the satisfying ability to do  targeted dashes, allowing me to zoom straight up to floating adversaries otherwise out of reach and resulting in some very entertaining killstreaks. Blue Fire builds slowly at first, as the foreboding tight corridors of the mysterious floating castle you start in open up into larger halls, varied environments, and bottomless pits aplenty. Initially I wasn’t really digging the fact that I had to pay just to unlock checkpoints where I could save and respawn, using one of a few different types of currencies gathered from tearing apart enemies and scattered debris. That currency is shared with upgrade unlocks, and at times it felt like I had to forego buying new attire, Spirits, or upgrades out of fear that I’d find myself exploring a new area only to die and lose my progress a few feet away from a checkpoint I was too poor to activate. A few areas are locked away until you reach specific parts of the story, but most are instead gated behind enticing ledges, bridges, and platforms left just out of reach until you obtain the right movement abilities – be that an extra jump or a series of wallruns. By the end of my 12 hour adventure, I was practically able to fly across early areas that once had me carefully plotting every single jump. Once I found some very hidden equippable Spirits that enhanced my character with increased dashing length (on top of a second consecutive dash), a third jump, and more, it almost felt like cheating as I strafed circles around opponents and cleared rooms without ever touching the ground.Seeing these areas in a new light helped soften the blow of Blue Fire’s reliance on backtracking.  Early on, your pint-sized hero is occasionally asked to assist the gods – under assault in their own temples – in entertaining little mini-dungeons full of puzzle rooms, keys in chests, and locked doors leading to new abilities and corrupted bosses. While the Hollow Knight influence is clear elsewhere, these areas reminded me more of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker than anything else. One challenging yet fun room had me using my newly minted double jump to perform a treacherous climb up a series of moving and disappearing platforms to reach the top before a timer shut the door, and one wrong move would send me hurtling back to the start, but I was pleased to find I could quickly course correct with a dash or wall-run to salvage my progress. This deity-saving setup led me to believe I’d be helping out each of Blue Fire’s five gods in order to beat back the Shadow corrupting the castle, but to my dismay things quickly switched gears after only two temples. Once equipped with wall-running and double jumping, Blue Fire abruptly drops the dungeon idea in favor of seeking out three boss “shadow lords” directly. Instead of facing new contained challenges, this had me mostly returning to earlier regions to press previously inactive buttons or collecting orbs to unlock boss doors –  even with upgraded movement tech refreshing these locations, it felt like an unexpectedly quick sprint to the finish. This pivot might have worked better if the first half of Blue Fire’s adventure lasted a bit longer, but I was happy to see at least one of the boss lieutenants had me searching through an unexplored region. And even in old locations, all the bosses proved to be a fun exercise in quickly dodging new types of attacks and putting my sustained aerial combat ability to the test. Besides, as entertaining as Blue Fire’s enemies are, the optional challenge rooms called Voids steal the spotlight. Similar to Super Mario Sunshine’s secret levels or A Hat in Time’s Rifts, Voids test your platforming skills in the best possible way. From quickly hopping across tiny temporary platforms to wall-running and bouncing off blocks to dodge an array of killer buzzsaws and spikes, each Void presents a new trial to overcome – and makes you feel like a platforming paragon for beating them. Several Voids will have you running across more walls than the prince of Persia himself, and they generously increase your stamina to compensate for the amount of time you’ll spend before ever touching solid ground. Completing Voids will boost your maximum health, and even if you don’t manage to make it to the end of one, collecting tokens along the way will let you unlock more Spirit slots – which means more chances to boost your parkour abilities to overcome that one seemingly impossible part of the gauntlet. Even after completing the story, I immediately dove back in to finish every last Void, especially to complete one I had been banging my head against for half an hour the first time I attempted it, as these things can be an excellent optional opportunity to push the limits of Blue Fire’s platforming mechanics. Blue Fire provides an impeccable platforming experience with the just right balance of abilities to master and challenges to test you, making its bleak and corrupted world a joy to explore. Its Zelda-like dungeon experiences may end a bit too soon before it begins relying on overly familiar backtracking, but it doesn’t dull the fun of dashing around obstacles and fighting enemies alike. And even when the pacing of its main path falters slightly, the irresistible lure of its inventive challenge rooms kept me coming back for more. "
273,The Last Campfire ,9.0," Finding light in the darkness is something we can all relate to -- whether it be as simple as discovering the solution to a small puzzle or as grand a notion as searching for one’s purpose in life. The Last Campfire addresses both ends of this spectrum and does so throughout with charm, smarts, and grace. Hello Games’ short-ish adventure hits the mark with cleverly designed puzzles, eye-catching style, and a touching story that left me feeling anything but forlorn.  Forlorns, in this world, are lost souls scattered around the colourful land of The Last Campfire; they’ve seemingly abandoned all hope and feel bereft of a purpose. This is in stark contrast to our character, Ember, whose purpose appears more predestined; Ember makes their way through forests, swamps, and caves trying to help as many lost souls as possible, while also questioning what their purpose in the world is. By lighting campfires along the way you’re helping guide the Forlorns on their journey and allowing them to follow in your footsteps. Granted, you never quite know where those footsteps will take them, but by showing the Forlorns that they exist, you allow them to see that there is always light worth finding in the darkness. It was a clear and ultimately highly rewarding journey as I became more and more invested in the world and the creatures calling it home. Progress is made through solving consistently enjoyable puzzles that almost always hit that sweet spot of not being so simple that they’re boring but being challenging enough to satisfy upon solving, without becoming so complicated that it induces groans. Special items and novel mechanics are introduced throughout which prevent the puzzles from ever becoming too repetitive, and while there maybe isn’t quite the level of variation you’d expect over its six or seven hours, it never fails to offer up something new just before it reaches a point of becoming stale. One of the biggest additions is the fun telekinetic-like ability that comes into play about halfway through the story, and it’s used in many of the subsequent puzzles in clever ways. Manipulating objects from a distance using this provides a welcome breath of fresh air and allows for more ingenious puzzles to be solved in new satisfying ways.   Hello’s inspirations are clear to see, and not least in the design of these puzzle rooms. It’s hard not to be reminded of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild’s many shrines -- though there’s no combat at all in The Last Campfire, and this is where different Nintendo influence becomes visible. The minimal approach to gameplay (you can walk, run, pick up, and push and pull objects, but that’s about it) combined with Ember’s inability to jump adds shades of the delightful Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker into the mix.  With such a limited set of button inputs you’d think it would be difficult to keep things fresh over an extended length of time, but The Last Campfire rarely has trouble there due to its creative use of what it has. It does a fantastic job of constantly mixing things up and keeping these problems thematically relevant, never once taking you out of its gloriously crafted world. The way that meaning is weaved into the design of each puzzle makes The Last Campfire stand out against many similar games and does so smartly at each turn. The core theme of preserving hope and purpose can be found at every turn, often subtly, but sometimes literally baked into the mechanics of a puzzle. This is most obviously exemplified in a series of problems that have you transport an open flame through a level while avoiding airstreams that will cause the fire to extinguish. These start off simple but build in complexity as Ember’s story progresses, providing just one example of how well The Last Campfire takes its central ideas and grows them into something special.  As with any game in this genre there’ll always be puzzles that feel too easy and are over in seconds -- there aren’t many of these but they can be found near the start where a few simple block pushes can form a path for Ember. On the opposite end of the spectrum are more complex problems that, although never too difficult, do offer a significant but satisfying challenge. Naturally, these occur nearer the end of Ember’s journey and smartly layer mechanics you’ve learned previously with new ideas. Some of my favourites of these involved telekinetically moving around a chained set of snake statues with mirrors attached to solve a reflection-based light puzzle.   This type of puzzle is another example of guiding the light through the darkness; again, Hello puts the core themes of The Last Campfire on display for all to see. This can also be seen in the art design, which beautifully offsets the bleakness with bright and colourful splashes. The most obvious example of this being Ember’s vivid blue clothing and glowing eyes that pop off of the screen during each scene alongside the relaxing, subtle music that soundtracks your journey. Environments range from waterway-filled caverns to pig-infested marshlands, each with their own quirks and pop-up book-ish charm. It’s an inviting world to play in, like Thatgamecompany painting from a Media Molecule palette, evoking both Journey and Tearaway in equal measure. Indeed, the storybook nature of The Last Campfire can’t be ignored. From finding lost book pages written in melancholic ink littered around the world to the larger-than-life creatures (literally, in the case of a quite monstrous pig) you’ll meet on your travels. I particularly enjoyed bumping into and helping out a wistful fisherman by a lake and a talkative robot who gleefully reminded me of Tik-Tok from Return to Oz. Perhaps the most folktale-like aspect to all of it, though, is the way in which the story itself is told. Brilliantly narrated by Rachel August, it’s spoken entirely in third person and calls out actions as you make them in a way that’s hugely reminiscent of Bastion’s storytelling technique (a design choice that has bafflingly still been used sparingly outside of Supergiant). Not only does the narrator tell the story in a fable-like manner - voicing all of the characters like a parent reading a bedtime story - but also offers moments of encouragement to Ember as their journey continues, effectively acting as a passive ally.   The story it tells is one that any age can relate to. Taking pages out of Aesop’s Fables and Grimm Brothers tales it touches on real-world problems in fantastical ways, cleverly disguising mature themes in easily digestible ways by having many of the characters suffering from things like anxiety or loss. It still managed to magically put a smile on my face throughout, though, building to an impactful and emotionally packed finale that serves as a fitting end to Ember’s odyssey. The Last Campfire is a fantastic blend of smart puzzles, eye-catching art direction, and a beautifully told tale that make Ember’s journey nothing short of a joy. With puzzle boxes Nintendo would be proud of, its inspirations are clear to see. Alongside its storybook sense of style, these parts come together to create a memorable experience filled with themes close to all of us, set in a world far away. The developers of No Man’s Sky have created an infinitely smaller and more focused world for all to enjoy; a puzzle adventure whose emotionally affecting story and consistently fun problems to solve combine to make The Last Campfire burn bright. "
274,The Medium ,8.0, There are always two sides to every story, but rarely does the audience get to experience them both at the same time. Such is the novel gameplay hook central to The Medium, an enthralling psychological horror adventure that splits your focus between a gloomy real-world setting and a haunting parallel spirit world, with actions performed in one having a measurable impact on the other. It’s a stylish and clever technique that’s used to consistently engaging effect, allowing for some stimulating puzzle design and exhilarating moments of reality-hopping cat and mouse with a truly memorable monster. I quickly warmed to the self-deprecating charm of The Medium’s split-screen scream queen, Marianne. She’s a spirit guide who is lured to an abandoned resort in the Polish hinterland hoping to uncover the origin of her clairvoyant abilities, and her consistently wry observations – delivered by actress Kelly Burke – kept the mood from becoming too dire in what is an otherwise intensely disturbing detective tale. Determining the extent of the evil atrocities that went down within the hotel’s walls and identifying the perpetrators soon becomes the main focus, one that I took great morbid delight in as I pieced together each and every sinister scrap of evidence along its bloodsoaked breadcrumb trail.  Much of the clue gathering is admittedly fairly straightforward in a mechanical sense, using Marianne’s insight ability on discarded objects found in the world to reveal information about the fate of their owners, for example, or to highlight the ghostly footsteps that point the way forward. But elsewhere there are some satisfyingly hands-on methods you need to employ, and I particularly enjoyed the simple pleasure of arranging trays of photography chemicals and dunking the paper in the right sequence of solutions in order to develop a photo correctly in a dark room. (Remember developing photos? ... No? Okay.)  Of course, almost every room in The Medium is a dark room, and they only get darker. At predetermined points along the main story path the screen will split to reveal the spirit world side by side with the material world, and you’ll suddenly be controlling two versions of Marianne at the same time. It’s an incredibly striking contrast; on one side of the screen the flesh and bone Marianne will be moving along a dimly lit hotel corridor, on the other, her silver-haired spiritual form will be stalking through a hollowed-out hallway to Hell. On both sides of the divide the environments are exceptionally well realised, but it’s the spirit world that is particularly eerie to explore, with unearthly tendrils sprouting from the floors, outstretched hands clawing at you like stalactites from the ceiling, and your general surroundings resembling a nightmarish landscape the likes of which isn’t normally seen anywhere outside of a heavy metal album cover. On that note, in this otherworld you frequently reveal new areas by slashing through sheets of human skin with a blade made of bones, which also sounds like the opening lyric to the most metal song ever made. dir=""ltr""  That said, it’s not just the haunted souls of the hotel you’ll have to contend with, but also the ghosts of horror games past. There are plenty of odd-shaped keys to find, valves to turn, and broken lever handles to repair, which on paper may sound like dated throwbacks to the likes of Alone in the Dark. However, it’s the use of Marianne’s reality-phasing abilities to uncover and obtain these items that makes The Medium feel distinct, and that kept me engaged in clearing a path through its increasingly ominous obstacles.  The other force propelling me forward was The Medium’s principal villain, The Maw. While I certainly enjoyed the strong performances from Marianne and the small supporting cast (both human and spiritual) it’s Troy Baker’s uncharacteristic and entirely unsettling turn as The Medium’s chief antagonist that really steals the show. dir=""ltr""  I say that metaphorically, since you can’t actually look over your shoulder in The Medium. Well, not on purpose at least. While each of developer Bloober Team’s horror games to date have been in first-person, from Layers of Fear 2 to Observer to Blair Witch, The Medium is a strictly third-person affair, appropriating the multiple fixed camera angles of the early Resident Evil and Silent Hill games that change up from room to room. Apparently this decision was partially born out of necessity, since giving free control over the camera was reportedly causing nausea during the dual-reality sections. Yet while the many claustrophobic close-ups and cinematic angles certainly contribute to an ongoing sense of trepidation, The Medium doesn’t have the power to manipulate or disorient you as deviously as Bloober’s previous first-person games. It isn’t able to unsettle you by diverting your attention one way in order to rearrange the environment behind you, for example. It’s a hair-raising ride regardless, but the most disoriented I ever felt during the eight hours it took to complete the story was anytime the camera suddenly switched angles and I had to course-correct with an awkward stutter step like someone who’d just narrowly avoided walking into the wrong bathroom by accident. The Medium uses a unique reality-shifting ability to bring a new dimension to some tried-and-tested genre puzzle-solving mechanics. It presents an intriguing mystery to unravel and adds a tangible sense of urgency to your investigations by placing a truly memorable villain hot on your heels. It isn’t able to play with perspective as effectively as some of Bloober Team’s other work, but it’s brilliantly paced and palpably tense. An absorbing and nerve-racking journey from the shriek of its first jump scare to its very last gasp, The Medium delivers a psychological horror adventure that’s all thriller and no filler. "
275,Cyber Shadow ,8.0, Cyber Shadow sets out to answer a very simple question: what would an NES Ninja Gaiden game look and play like if it were made today? Admittedly, it’s a hypothetical that The Messenger sort of already answered back in 2018... but look, sometimes questions like these can have multiple good answers, and Cyber Shadow is no better proof of that. This retro-styled action platformer developed by Mechanical Head Studios and published by Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Game is a  truly great take on the 2D Ninja Gaiden formula – but more than that, it’s constantly evolving and brilliantly adds new gameplay and level design challenges with every new upgrade that it gives you. These upgrades continue to compound upon each other to the point that, by the time you reach the end of Cyber Shadow’s seven to eight-hour adventure, it’s morphed from a simple yet fun action platformer to an absolutely wild and occasionally brutally difficult one that surpasses its inspiration in every way.  Cyber Shadow puts you into the pixelated ninja boots of the titular (cyber) Shadow, who awakens from an incubation pod to find a destroyed city that’s been overrun by out-of-control machines. It’s a serviceable story at best, told through both in-game dialogue boxes and nostalgic 8-bit cutscenes with large, detailed, but still very low-res sprites, much like the NES Ninja Gaiden games. Its big weakness is that there’s just very little personality to any of it. Shadow himself is a mute protagonist, and with one notable exception (who’s gone all too quickly) all of the characters he interacts with largely feel like they exist solely to be exposition dumps. There’s little reason to care about the evil Dr. Progen, your master, or the members of your clan he holds captive. Where Cyber Shadow does deliver, however, is in its gameplay. It really hits on all fronts: level design, enemy design, enemy variety, character progression, boss battles – it’s all top notch. Your set of tools begins very modestly: Shadow can jump and can slash his sword horizontally, and... that’s it. This limited moveset is a large part of what drives the challenge in the early goings because enemies and obstacles approach from all angles but you can only hit things that are directly in front of you (much like in, you guessed it, Ninja Gaiden).   But this is a modern take on old-school design, and it comes with modern assists to help smooth the hard edges a little: checkpoints not only give you a respawn point but also restore your health when you step on them. If that’s not enough, you can spend a currency called essence to unlock permanent upgrades for that specific checkpoint that will either restore your magic or provide you with a powerup when you respawn from there. These powerups are especially cool because they’re almost always specifically designed to be especially useful in the upcoming section; for example, a shield that can block projectiles from the front right that becomes available before a particularly bullet-hellish encounter. My absolute favorite powerup, though, is the aptly named Swag Blade. This monster tethers a saw blade to your character that can be manipulated through your momentum. So if there’s an enemy above you that you can’t hit with your sword, you can simply jump in place until the Swag Blade gets enough momentum to bounce up and down and reach it. Or if there’s an enemy straight ahead, you can also strike the blade with your sword to give it some instant forward momentum and take them out from a distance. It’s a super fun and creative weapon to use, and I wish I was given more opportunity to do so than the one chapter it’s available in.  Cyber Shadow really hits its stride just a little more than halfway through, once you gain the ability to sprint. It’s at this point where it metamorphosizes from a Ninja Gaiden-esque larva state and becomes entirely its own beast. Sprinting gives you the ability to use a super-fast dash slice that can go right through enemies and obstacles, allowing you to use it both as a devastating attack and to reach new areas – sometimes even both at the same time. Some of the best moments came when I was able to dash my way across a level without ever touching the ground. All throughout Cyber Shadow’s campaign, it never feels like it’s running out of ideas, and I found myself uniquely challenged by each new chapter even as my abilities and strengths grew. A lot is thrown at you all at once, often while forcing you to deal with some other sort of environmental nightmare, like: orbital laser beams, a creeping mass of instant-kill spikes, a rising elevator that threatens to squish you below instant-kill spikes, or security lasers that, when tripped, will activate extra enemy robots and turrets that mercilessly hunt you down. Needless to say, Cyber Shadow becomes quite difficult, but it's a difficulty that always felt manageable once I’d learned the various quirks and nuances of the many enemies that patrol each chapter. Most have multiple spots where they can be hit, and they change their behavior depending on what part of their body you break; others are seemingly impenetrable until you’re able to use Shadow’s projectile parry to stop their bullets and send them flying right back towards them; and others still fly at you from awkward angles, forcing you to reposition before you’re able to take them out. There’s just an incredible amount of variety in the enemy design, and it works hand in hand with both the level design and Shadow’s upgrades to ensure that Cyber Shadow is consistently fresh and challenging. dir=""ltr""  After defeating the final boss I was surprised to find that there’s no New Game+ or anything of the sort waiting in the post game, but there are plenty of collectibles and upgrades that can be found by revisiting earlier levels with abilities you obtain later, which provides some extra value for those who like to aim for 100% completion. Beyond that, there’s also the signature Yacht Club list of feats that provide a set of unique challenges, like making it to the first boss without killing any enemies or defeating a certain boss without damaging it with your sword. There’s seemingly no reward for completing these, but they’re fun and interesting enough to make me want to try and accomplish as many as I can anyway; a task that will keep me busy for quite a while. Finally, it’s worth mentioning one other similarity between Cyber Shadow and The Messenger: their soundtracks are both absolute bangers. Every chapter has its own theme song, often with multiple arrangements that adjust the moods appropriately, and it’s all extremely catchy and well produced. Cyber Shadow is a wonderful merging of old-school aesthetic and modern design sensibilities, much like Shovel Knight was back in 2014. Sure, its story is forgettable and some of its checkpoint placements are far enough apart to make me hesitant to apply a “tough but fair” label without caveats, but the way it evolves and changes over the course of its seven to eight hour campaign thanks to excellent level, enemy, and progression design is exemplary. Combine that with what’s an early contender for best soundtrack of 2021, and it’s easy to see Cyber Shadow as the start of something great for both Mechanical Head Studios and Yacht Club Games. "
276,Hitman 3 ,9.0,"Agent 47’s unique brand of slow-paced stealth in an assortment of dense, deadly, and deeply varied murder playgrounds has reached a wonderful crescendo in Hitman 3. While it doesn’t stray from the killer chord combination developer IO Interactive crafted for 2016’s Hitman – and continued to use in 2018’s Hitman 2 – it’s abundantly clear here that the studio has well and truly mastered its act. With some of the most surprising and imaginative levels in the series so far, Hitman 3 may feel largely familiar to its two most-recent predecessors, but just thinking of the hours upon hours of chaos, carnage, and cruel comedy that each of its six outstanding new maps will produce makes me giddy.  This final chapter of IO’s ‘World of Assassination’ trilogy that began with 2016’s Hitman might be better thought of as an expansion than a sequel. If you’ve bounced off Hitman before – particularly in the last five years – know that there’s been no big reinvention of the bald bloke’s blueprint in Hitman 3. The interface and controls have remained consistent in their stiffness, and the range of uses for your weapons and items aren’t drastically different, either. The most notable new toy in Hitman 3 is a camera which can be used to hack or examine switches and items, which is handy but not really a game changer. The true strength of Hitman 3, then, is found in its maps. All six of Hitman 3’s beautiful and strikingly well-lit levels are amongst the strongest of the series, so much so that it’s hard to pick a standout favourite. Things get off to a fairly stunning start, with 47 parachuting onto the world’s tallest building in Dubai and infiltrating its opulent interior, but that high bar is maintained throughout. The follow-up mission is a nod and a wink to Contracts’ Beldingford Manor map and takes 47 to a similarly massive UK country manor where one entertainingly ironic route to killing your target involves posing as a detective who’s there to solve a murder on the property. From there it’s off to a massive German rave for a mission that oozes atmosphere and puts an interesting twist on hunting down your five targets amongst the throngs of sweaty, 24-hour party people, and then to Chongqing, China, where the glow of neon lights, the reflections in the soaked streets, and the trickle of rain down 47’s jacket combine for perhaps the most visually impressive mission of the series so far. The next stop is an Argentinian vineyard that reminded me of Blood Money’s excellent A Vintage Year map, only vastly bigger; then the finale is a fabulous surprise unlike any Hitman mission to date, and one which I sincerely hope isn’t spoiled for you. It’s tricky to speak about these locations in too much detail without ruining the thrill of strolling through them and revealing massive new areas you had no idea existed, but these environments are truly some of the most memorable and remarkable maps IO has ever created – from the intimidating verticality on display while perched on the outside of the highest skyscraper in the world to the rustic charm of Thornbridge Manor. I’m equally hesitant to reveal the quirky assassination opportunities they contain but I will say Hitman 3 contains both the funniest and the most complex Hitman kill I’ve ever played – and at least one of the most-dastardly – and there are still many I haven’t got to yet. Yes, a lot of the kills are gentle remixes of ones that have come before, but they’re still cleverly built up. As always, the slow-burn thrill of these games comes from planning, patience, and hiding in plain sight. The key to success is finding the perfect disguise for exploration, listening and looking for opportunities, and getting the timing just right to pull off the perfect crime and escape unseen. It’s an unapologetically single-player experience that rewards rational thinking over rushing, although it is flexible enough to cater to both extremes: those who prefer to follow the multilayered mini-stories playing out within the levels to make invisible, surgical strikes and disappear without a trace, and those who like to improvise and leave behind piles of dead and unconscious men in their underpants stacked like cordwood. You can get away with all of this because the often hilariously naïve AI is still easy to exploit as ever. Of course, tricking the dopey guards and civilians with unexpected distractions and suspicious items has emerged as such a fundamental part of the puzzle solving in the current Hitman trilogy, and I’ve actually grown to love these dumb bastards over the years. These folks won’t even blink an eye at a severe-faced stranger who’s wearing the clothes of a man they’ve very recently had a conversation with and, while that does rob stealthy victories of believability at times, this kind of suspension of disbelief is simply necessary for Hitman to function. As grim as the murder-for-hire premise seems on the surface, this has always been a cheekily self-aware series that relishes in a general degree of silliness and gallows humour. The biggest advantage of there not being any revolutionary changes in Hitman 3 is that owners of Hitman and Hitman 2 can carry over their levels and progress to Hitman 3. There’s a certain tidiness to rolling the trilogy into a single product that I really like, and I admire IO’s commitment to keeping the previous games’ content alive like this.On Xbox Series X this is mostly seamless; as an owner of both previous Hitman games on Xbox One, Hitman 3 was automatically augmented with all previous maps, although the progression carry-over functionality wasn’t operational for me at the time of review. The PC situation is hindered somewhat by the shift from Steam to the Epic Games Store, though IO Interactive has gone on the record that an import feature will be available within weeks. iframe allowautoplay="""" allowfullscreen=""true"" class=""gallery gallery embeddedgallery"" data-src=""/gallery/42717/embed"" height=""652"">The lack of native support for PSVR on PS5 also meant I had to download and install the PS4 version of Hitman 3 alongside the PS5 version, which is a bit of a messy solution – but that’s really on Sony rather than IO. For its part, IO provides a free digital copy of the PS4 version to all who buy the PS5 version so nobody misses out.When you get it up and running, Hitman in VR is worth a dabble if you own a PSVR, though really only to experience its general slapstick goofiness first-hand. You have to play with the DualShock 4 because the Move controllers just don’t have enough buttons and, while it can generally handle melee attacks, the shooting experience is really quite cumbersome, imprecise, and irritating as a consequence. The end result is a system that winds up marooned halfway between full motion controls and traditional controls – which I found regularly brain-bending and occasionally stomach churning. There’s no denying that getting access to all of Hitman and Hitman 2’s levels in VR is incredible value – and it’s a novelty feeling as if you’re truly inside these levels – but it’s janky, primitive, and really not the best way to play. Rich, rewarding, and highly replayable, Hitman 3 is a superb instalment of IO’s idiosyncratic but much-loved stealth series. The fundamentals haven’t changed since 2016 but its collection of outstanding maps makes for a refined, reliable, and robust curtain-closer to the current Hitman trilogy. Six maps may sound slim but each one is huge and designed to be played several times over – and even then it’s very unlikely you’ll have uncovered all of its creative and surprising assassination opportunities. There really isn’t a weak one in the bunch. This barcoded butcher has made a lot of appearances over the past 20 years, but Hitman 3 is definitely one of his best. "
277,Factorio ,8.0, Rags-to-riches survival games are a dime a dozen these days, but Factorio’s wild ambition and open-ended format takes the potential for complexity up several notches. It starts you off as a spaceship crash survivor with only a pickaxe with which to explore its randomly generated 2D planets, but stick with it long enough and you can build all the way up to fighting aliens with tanks and creating manufacturing megastructures in seconds with a personal robot swarm. While it gets a little slow in certain places and its ultra-complex logistics chains can be overwhelming, the rewarding depth that can be extracted from its whirring conveyor belts and steam-belching power plants are worth the trouble.   iframe allowautoplay="""" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/gallery/42813/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery42813"" scrolling=""no""> That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, as anyone who’s played great games like Minecraft, Dwarf Fortress, or Crusader Kings can tell you. Factorio scratches some similar itches with its intimidating but exciting depth: once I got into a groove, learning how to weave underground conveyor belts to connect extractors to refineries to multiple layers of factories to create an optimal assembly line, I found expanding and upgrading my factory almost Zen at times. And it's pretty forgiving of mistakes, since you can rearrange machinery fairly easily and without cost, so it's actually unlikely you'll mess up so badly you can't save it on the default difficulty. It just takes a little time.  Progression can feel a bit tedious now and then, like when you realize your next level of science – which is “researched” by manufacturing different colored science units out of various materials – requires two products you don't have, and each of those is made from two or more secondary products you also don't have, which may even require you to seek out new raw resources far from your main base. And also you're running out of copper again so you need to explore new areas of the map and build an outpost that can supply more to your main base. Trying to figure out what steps I needed to take and in what order could give me a slight headache, and there’s a fair amount of repetition involved in setting up a new supply line that works exactly like the previous ones but with a different extractor building. But the satisfaction of getting everything working properly is a hell of a drug.  What really saves Factorio from slipping into monotony are some key techs that can totally change the way you play, and they’re spaced nicely through the tree. Unlocking trains lets you ship large quantities of materials quickly over long distances on a schedule. Cars, and later tanks, give you personal mobility and a major combat advantage against this alien world's single-minded insectoid inhabitants who resist your industrial revolution. And eventually, populating your base with autonomous drones will allow you to do things like move resources from extraction sites to refineries without a maze of conveyor belts, or even copy and paste large, multi-part structures for easy expansion. It’s one of those games that feels like it doesn't even really start until you’re 20 or more hours in and have access to a lot of tools that make your life much easier. And even after more than 40, my most advanced factory still has a lot left to unlock. The map is sprawling enough to accommodate some truly magnificent and intricately designed manufacturing facilities – the only limit is what you can wrap your head around and your CPU finally saying enough is enough.  Defending your bases with walls and turrets is viable, but I found it more exciting to take the fight to them and make sure there were no active nests anywhere near my base or outposts. The early enemies are pretty trivial, and you can plink away at them with a basic pistol effectively. But the longer you play on a given map, the more they'll evolve new unit types. You need to keep up in the arms race by researching better guns, better armor, and unlocking military techs like tanks, artillery, and combat drones or you'll eventually be overwhelmed. The clever interplay between the different enemy types makes taking down their bases a hectic challenge as you have to dodge acid-spitting worms and use the terrain or your own pre-built kill zones to avoid getting surrounded. Later techs, like modular power armor customizable with energy shields, personal drones, and more, slowly turn you into a futuristic superhero. iframe allowautoplay="""" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/gallery/39472/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery39472"" scrolling=""no""> If the default bugs aren't challenging you enough, or you don't want to deal with them at all, the map generator has tons of settings to customize your experience, too. You can play on a peaceful map with lots of trees and water, a desolate death world that's literally crawling with foes from the very beginning, or anything in between. And Wube Software did itself a favor by making Factorio extensively moddable: tons of add-ons are available already from the lengthy early access period to give you an even more control over your set-up or add new techs and extra quality-of-life features. dir=""ltr"" The sheer amount of stuff there is to do in Factorio is breathtaking and a bit frightening. Even with over 40 hours on my most-played save, some of the higher-end factories I've seen others build look like absolute witchcraft – it’s the kind of game that can become a second job if you let it. But thanks to an ever increasing alien threat and some well-placed keystone techs that give you new toys and really change things up, I never hit a point of complete monotony where I felt like I was just building things to build more things for no particular reason. I could easily see myself sinking hundreds more hours into this elaborate contraption, seeing how big I can build and trying out totally new base layouts. It's got a very high buy-in to learn, but Factorio rewards you with entertaining logistics puzzles and a sense of ownership over something colossal and impressive if you put the time in. "
278,Among Us ,9.0, It may have originally come out in 2018, but Among Us took 2020 by storm, and it's deserving of that spotlight. Innersloth has made the tense, multiplayer fun of in-person cloak and dagger games like Mafia and Werewolf work on PC, mobile, and consoles with a flourish. And the great times I've had slaying, lying, and sleuthing my way through its charming sci-fi world got me wondering why it took so long for this sort of game to catch on. There are still a few technical hitches to be worked out, just like the fussy engines on the Skeld, but that hasn't kept me from coming back to it again and again in my down time.   The art is whimsical, with your bulbous, quirky astronauts stumbling around engine bays and reactor decks that look like the doodles I used to do in the margins of my notes in school. This is effective for a couple of reasons. For one, it keeps the mood pretty light, which is important in a game where you're going to be lying to, and being lied to, by your friends every single round. It's hard to take getting ganked in the middle of a task for the fifth time too personally when the animation for your demise makes you laugh after you're done yelling. The art style also makes interacting with the various machines and doodads on the map intuitive and enjoyable. I was able to drop right into my first match and get a decent grasp of what was going on without needing much help.  iframe allowautoplay="""" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/gallery/39964/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery39964"" scrolling=""no"">Some of my favorite impostor rounds have been those in which I coasted to victory in a public game by changing my handle to something unassuming, like ""joey07"", and acting like I'm a young kid who doesn't really understand the rules that well. Aside from how I type and what I do or do not choose to comment on, I can even make a big show of having a hard time getting around the ship or not understanding how crew tasks work. Knowing how to perform innocence, even to the point that you half believe you're innocent yourself, is a great skill to have. But it's a common enough strategy that if you overdo it, at this point, experienced players will catch on. So sometimes I have two cover identities: one that's way too obvious, and another that I want my opponents to figure out and think that's the final layer. But it's not. The mind games can get really deep, and they're my favorite part of Among Us.  There are some technical issues, still. Finding a match can be frustrating, since the clunky, dated browser only shows you a limited number of lobbies at a time. It can be tricky to find games that aren’t already full or are a long way from getting there. And the fact that there's no mechanic to punish players who rage-quit when they don't get to play as impostor, or are caught dead to rights in the middle of a murder; those can lead entire rounds to premature, unsatisfying endings. Adding a quick match button and some way to disincentivize quitters, like a time out before you can join another match if you quit too often, would both go a long way – not to mention built-in voice chat support.  Among Us lives up to the hype created by its delayed explosion in popularity, for the most part. It's a style of intense, refreshing multiplayer experience that simply didn't catch on digitally before recently. Its well-earned following speaks to just how enticing murdering and deceiving your friends can be, as well as Innersloth's endearing art, approachability, and clever minigame design. I don't have any sus that this will be the last game of its breed to make a splash, since we’re already seeing its influence on even mega-games like Fortnite. But it’s the breakout hit for the genre, and it's a great first impression. "
279,Monster Train ,9.0, When my wife first saw me playing Monster Train she thought I’d gotten hooked on Slay The Spire again and she’d have to put up with another stretch of me playing it incessantly. I had good news and bad news for her: the good news is that, despite also being a colorful and cartoony game in which you pick new cards and modifier items after every fight to improve your deck, and then spend energy to use those cards in turn-based battle, Monster Train is a very different take on the deck-building roguelike idea. The bad news (again, for her, not for Monster Train) is that it’s every bit as fantastically deep, dynamic, and replayable, and it’s kept me just as engrossed as Slay The Spire ever did. The most obvious difference is that instead of having just one character attacking and casting spells, Monster Train puts you in command of many creatures – and they can be summoned onto the first three of your train’s four floors to create an increasingly complex gauntlet for enemies to run through on their way to attack its power source at the top. Why does a train have four floors? That’s… unclear, as trains are traditionally laid out horizontally. But Monster Train has some very odd lore around it about a quest to restart the fires of Hell that provides some crazy, colorful backdrops for its battles and successfully handwaves away any sort of questions – such as “Why is Hell good and Heaven bad now?” – as not important anyway.  Variety is king in a game like this, and it’s impressive how differently each of Monster Train’s five decks play. The Hellhorned demons are hard-hitting creatures who build up rage to increase their attack power even more; the Melting Remnant relies on cheap, temporary units made of wax that burn out and die after a set number of turns but can be revived even stronger; the ghoulish Umbra depend on summoning and consuming creatures called morsels to strengthen others; Awoken uses a lot of retaliatory spikes and health regeneration on their plant-based units; and the aquatic Stygian Guard specializes in spells and damage over time. Because you pick two of those decks to play on each run, right there you have 10 different combinations you can use (many more if you include the fact that swapping the main and secondary will change which champion you’ll use, and you have the option to choose between two champions for each main deck), each with wildly different synergies between their abilities. You can, for example, feed morsels to demons to make them stronger or use the Melting Remant’s revival abilities on any other faction’s units, creating combos so powerful they seem broken – at first. Every time you defeat the final boss (a successful run takes around an hour) the challenge ramps up (unless you don’t want it to), to the point where anything less than a super-powered build will give you a snowball’s chance in Hell. The more I experimented and learned, the more I was rewarded with a nuanced understanding of how to maximize a deck’s potential.    You can usually make lemonade out of lemons if you think carefully about which of the random selections of cards and artifacts you’re presented with to choose, as well as the simple either-or choices of which of two tracks to take on the overworld map that’ll take you, for example, either a unit upgrade shop, a health pick-up, and a random new artifact or a spell upgrade shop, a free new modifier artifact, and the opportunity to duplicate any card other than your champion. These choices can dramatically change how you play and force you to change your plans and adapt, or pivot to a new opportunity you hadn’t anticipated instead of following the same playbook each time. Monster Train emphasizes tactics more than Slay The Spire because while the order of what spells you cast and units you place is always crucial in this type of game, here you also have to think about positioning across three floors at once (you can’t place units in the Pyre room at the top). Normally, the first unit in a row will take the burnt of the damage until they die and the guys in the rear are protected – unless the enemy has a Sweep modifier that allows it to attack all your troops at once. A lot of abilities, like the Armor Imp’s power to give an ally some protective armor, only affect the first unit in line, so you want to make sure your troops are lined up to take the greatest advantage of that. You also have to consider that, by default, all of the enemy units will attack first, which means you generally have to consider defense before offense – a unit with strong attack but weak defense won’t survive to make use of that attack unless it’s protected. But that’s upended if you have a unit with the Quick modifier, letting them strike first and opening up new strategies.  I will say that because Monster Train only saves at the start and end of each battle rather than after each turn it’s a little too easy to game the roguelike nature of it – a problem admittedly shared by Slay the Spire as well. Once I figured out that if my fingers slip and accidentally hit alt-F4 when I’m about to lose a battle the clock will be turned back when I reopen it, swallowing a defeat became much harder. But that’s kind of a me problem, isn’t it? If, somehow, you become tired of the normal runs, Monster Train has lots and lots of optional modifiers to make it easier or harder (such as playing without a champion or allowing you to place more units on every floor) plus daily challenges and asynchronous multiplayer where everybody competes for score with the same modifiers, and more. Once it got its hooks into me, Monster Train felt almost bottomless... and that was before the developer, Shiny Shoe, started adding new content. That’s been coming at a pace where if you put it down for a while and come back, there’ll probably be something new to try.  Monster Train is a ticket to dozens – if not hundreds – of hours of challenging and surprising roguelike deckbuilding runs, thanks in large part to its mechanically diverse set of decks and the way they interact with each other when combined in different ways. This spin on the idea appears similar to the also-outstanding Slay The Spire at first, but aside from some basic concepts and a similar (but not derivative) cartoonish art style for its large cast of monsters, it’s a radically different game. One where learning the ins and outs of its strategies is constantly rewarding. "
280,Cyberpunk 2077 for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 ,4.0, While I had just as much fun playing Cyberpunk 2077 on PC as Tom did playing for his review, on the base PlayStation 4 or Xbox One it is a different game entirely. It fails to hit even the lowest bar of technical quality one should expect even when playing on lower-end hardware. It performs so poorly that it makes combat, driving, and what is otherwise a master craft of storytelling legitimately difficult to look at. It is not an exaggeration to say that I’ve felt nauseated after playing because of the terrible frame rate. It really is that bad, and it’s very suspicious that CD Projekt Red refused to provide console review copies ahead of launch.   In short, neither the PS4 or Xbox One is able to hold a steady frame rate, and they often freeze altogether for seconds at a time. On the base model Xbox One, it appears to be running at less than 720p resolution at times (though that fluctuates due to dynamic scaling). Even so, you can expect to see it drop as low as 10 frames per second during combat, which is all but unplayable, and it’s around 20fps even when you’re doing simple and routine things like walking outside in the introduction. The PS4 is slightly better in performance and stability since patch 1.04, but at the sacrifice of texture load-in time. Characters will often appear blocky while you wait an agonizingly long time for their faces to show up to the party, and geometry or textures will sometimes fail to appear even with all the effects like film grain and motion blur turned off. If your only option right now is playing Cyberpunk 2077 on either of the base console platforms, I highly suggest you don’t play at all until its many terrible performance issues are fixed. And if you’ve already bought it and had an experience similar to what I’ve described, you should absolutely get a refund if possible. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions are simply not in an acceptable state, and it makes me sad to think that so many people are having their first Cyberpunk 2077 experience ruined this way – because when it works, it’s a fantastic RPG.

281,Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond ,6.0, Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond attempts to return to the series’ roots with a VR twist. It’s also storied Titanfall 2 developer Respawn Entertainment’s first step into VR and one of the first major World War 2-themed shooters to land in the medium. While it largely succeeds with frantic Nazi-killing action that brings you into the chaos of the second World War in locations like Omaha Beach and Peenemünde, its inconsistent tone and quality makes for a shooter campaign that drags on past its welcome. Next to that, though, is the truly impressive documentary dedicated to shedding light on the true stories of those who fought and served. Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond itself, however, pales in comparison, not only to the legendary legacy that it attempts to draw from, but also in comparison to other recent VR shooters. Before you can jump into this Oculus exclusive (which I played on an Oculus Rift S), you have to get past Medal of Honor’s shockingly high system specs that warn of performance issues on anything less than an RTX 2080 or equivalent — and you need a spectacular 340GB of storage space to even launch the installer in the first place before it settles into a mere [correction: the installer has since been updated to only require 180GB] 180GB. That’s right: Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond is almost as big as Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. But for all that, we do get a diverse number of wonderfully detailed scenes throughout, including the gorgeous French countryside and the Norwegian Telemark. That said, NPCs rarely manage to cross the uncanny valley in VR, making their stiff and overly drawn-out performances all the more difficult to sit through when you just want to get back into the action. Again, there are peaks and valleys in this landscape. Some of the most interesting challenges in the campaign have you searching for mines, planting bombs, and clambering your way out of a rapidly flooding Nazi U-Boat before paddling your way up to the ocean surface. Each of these makes pretty good use of the motion controllers, though because all of it is so scripted, none would feel out of place on a traditional keyboard-and-mouse shooter. Further, it’s a shame that there’s only a few limited physics-based interactions throughout the campaign. In the same year when we’ve played Half-Life: Alyx and even The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners, both of which use physics to cleverly present unique scenarios that would never work outside of VR, this minimal level of interactivity feels primitive. And then you’re back in the action. And while it’s often exciting, it keeps getting bogged down in battles with the annoyingly bullet-sponge enemy AI. After a while, that makes the whole thing repetitive. Combat is already much slower and more grounded in VR than in run-and-gun games like Call of Duty, but it’s disappointing that enemies rarely provide much challenge; most spawn and immediately rush toward you instead of working together to try and flank you. dir=""ltr""  Comfort also seems behind the times. There is no option to teleport here, and your character moves rather quickly when in full sprint mode. I don’t personally have an issue with this, but Above and Beyond is clearly designed for larger maps instead of smaller and more intimate ones, which is potentially nauseating for those who do suffer from motion sickness. Strafing is a useful way of navigating tight combat encounters, but it feels completely unnatural in VR, as if you’re sliding around on a skateboard rather than moving from side to side with your legs. On the other hand, there are some cool immersion effects here. For instance, if you toggle it on, you can see a “threat level” meter that appears over enemies’ heads so you can assess how to engage them in battle. You can also toggle camera shake and hit markers that boost the intensity of combat. These are great – if you can stomach them. dir=""ltr""  Survival mode is a little different and more interesting. It’s a set of challenges where you’ve got to hold out against an onslaught of Nazis for five minutes without dying. That’s not terribly novel on its own, but you can mix things up by adding harder modifiers in exchange for a higher score multiplier, or you can sacrifice your score multiplier in exchange for boons like more powerful weapons and abundant healing syringes. You can also mix and match these things, setting up interesting scenarios against the AI whenever you feel like it. dir=""ltr""  dir=""ltr"" The action in Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond never quite rises to the lofty goals it sets for itself as a way of honoring the real soldiers of World War 2. Its single-player campaign and Survival modes are enjoyable and offer a unique way to experience famous World War 2 battles reenacted in VR, but don't do much to distinguish themselves beyond that in terms of shooter mechanics and the bullet-sponge Nazis aren’t that much fun to shoot at. Considering the absolutely wild system requirements there is a staggering cost of entry to this ride, and while it’s a decent enough shooter, it ends up falling short of 2020’s sky-high VR standards. All of that comes as part of the package with its truly impressive set of interviews with World War 2 veterans and virtual tours of historical locations, but honestly those would probably be better off separated from the average-at-best shooter that’s handcuffed to them. "
282,World of Warcraft: Shadowlands ,8.0, World of Warcraft: Shadowlands doesn’t only straddle the line between life and death – it straddles the line between what was and what could be for Blizzard’s 16-year-old MMO. While it bombards us with familiar characters like Thrall, Jaina Proudmoore, and a few surprise returns in its opening fanfare, it also proceeds to gleefully kick open the doors to new corners of the Warcraft universe and introduce the intimidating Jailer. As the first main bad guy in WoW’s history who didn’t originate in the RTS games in some way, his arrival seems like the start of a whole new chapter of the story. At the same time, Shadowlands tries to turn the page on what max-level activities look like, and it has some success in reinvigorating WoW for yet another year. World of Warcraft has long felt like two different games to me, especially in more recent expansions: There's the usually exciting, fast-paced, story-dense levelling experience and then the repetitive and ultimately tiresome endgame. Shadowlands does that first part very well, as expected: it plays to WoW's strengths with a plot that kept me hooked for about 20 hours and new zones that are bizarre, distinct, and just wonderful. Revendreth, where the wicked dead go to repent of their sins at the hands of the vampiric Venthyr, is a delightfully gothic sprawl of creepy castles and tangled woods. The ethereal, nocturnal forest of Ardenweald, where creatures of nature are watched over by the dutiful Night Fae until they can be reincarnated into new mortal forms, is downright captivating in its starry luminance.  Ardenweald also gives us one of the best zone stories WoW has ever put together. Most of the characters are refreshingly new faces, and I found them intensely charming and memorable. Stalwart allies Niya and Korayn both endeared themselves to me almost immediately in their desire to try and do what's best even in a messy, heartbreaking situation. But the surprise guests from the existing lore are unexpected and very well presented, with a big build-up to a satisfying reveal. And the plight of your new fae allies takes some very affecting turns that go above and beyond WoW's typically pretty limited emotional range.  Our introduction to this new world is a bit light on whimsy, though, since we’re dumped pretty much immediately into The Maw. This is basically Warcraft’s version of Hell, where the most wicked souls go to suffer eternally. Everything from the foreboding music to the sickly orange color palette feel as oppressive as Icecrown while completely departing from its icy, blue and black look. The wicked enemies and buildings are still in line with the Lich King’s sense of style, though, reminding us that we’re seeing the realm from which his power originated. When the story ends, though, is where Shadowlands sets itself a step above previous expansions. Blizzard has long tried to sell us on the idea that the real game starts when you hit max level, and frankly, I've never bought into that: I generally lose interest and take a hiatus after I've level capped a few characters and run through all the dungeons a few times. But Shadowlands is the first expansion that has made me want to believe the company line in a while. Endgame activities have never been this diverse and interesting. It all starts with picking a Covenant – one of the four main factions of the Shadowlands – a choice independent of whether you're part of the Horde or Alliance. Alongside Revendreth and Ardenweald, Maldraxxus is the abode of dead warriors, where zombies and abominations with festering wounds and pointy armor (even for WoW) do battle eternally and revel in plagues and fleshcraft. The Kyrian of Bastion seek to purify themselves to earn their angelic wings and become the couriers who bring souls to the Shadowlands from the mortal plane. Each has a strong personality and cool set of new abilities, with one being for all covenant members and another specific to your class. On top of that, you'll get access to the covenant's Sanctum, which can be upgraded over time with things like special shortcuts around the zone only members can use, or the ability to summon secret world bosses that drop rare loot.  The star of the Shadowlands endgame is definitely Torghast though, a semi-randomized roguelike mega-dungeon that can be tackled solo or with a group. You accumulate randomized powers from anima caches, like you might blessings in Hades. These are mostly specific to your class and can make you hilariously overpowered in some creative ways. My favorite caused the damage of my next Steady Shot to increase by a lot every time I broke open a pot, which meant if I could avoid wasting the buff until the final boss, it was very possible to slice off half of its health bar with my weakest attack. Of course, you can only use these in Torghast, and they reset after every run. Each wing has different modifiers, and two out of the six are open every week, so you won't be facing the same challenges over and over. Torghast rewards you with Soul Ash, which is used to craft new personalized legendary items that, even at their lowest tier, are more powerful than mythic dungeon gear, so it feels worth your time.  There's a bit of a missed opportunity here though, too, because Torghast actually isn't infinitely repeatable. Or at least, the rewards aren't. Once you've cleared all the available floors in each wing for a given week, you can't get any more benefit from doing them again. This is a letdown, especially because of how much I enjoy Torghast and think it represents the exact direction WoW should be aiming in to keep its endgame vibrant and interesting. Just like I can pop into a fresh run of Hades any time I feel like it and come out with new stories and permanent upgrades to my character, I really, really wished Torghast would offer me the same opportunity. You'll also be returning to The Maw, which serves as this expansion's challenging max-level zone, and it's set up much differently than past ones. For one thing, there are no mounts allowed – not even ground mounts! Everything you do in The Maw, from killing tough world bosses to completing rinse-and-repeat daily quests, grants you Stygia, a currency that can be used to buy permanent upgrades to Torghast like an increased chance of rolling rare anima powers. The way Shadowlands limits the amount of Stygia you can reap in a day is a stacking debuff called Eye of the Jailer, in which the expansion's archvillain will focus more of his malevolent attention on you the more you make a mess of his realm. At first, he'll target you with periodic area attacks from his watch towers, then he'll send assassins after you, and eventually slap you with a terrifying curse that will make you unable to recover health and sooner or later drop dead. Playing in The Maw feels way different from other WoW zones. It actually seems risky and thrilling to even make my way from Point A to Point B. Borrowing a dash of Dark Souls, dying causes you to drop a portion of your current Stygia, which you'll have to return to your corpse to recover. If you die twice in a row, it's gone forever. This is a big adjustment since death in WoW is generally no more than a minor inconvenience. Stygia is such a limited, prized resource that takes so long to acquire, seeing a bunch of it evaporate is far more painful than just losing the time it takes to run back to your body or the relatively paltry gold cost of repairing damaged gear. But I really enjoy the tension this adds.The actual World of Warcraft hasn't felt this dangerous since trying to navigate high-level areas like the Burning Steppes in vanilla, back in 2004.  But between Stygia, Reputation, Anima, Redeemed Souls, Grateful Offerings, Soul Ash, Phantasma, Renown, Sinstone Fragments… there are a lot of different currencies that tie into endgame progression in different ways. Let me be frank: It's way too many. Keeping track of which ones are spent on which things, and how each one can be acquired, and how much of each you can earn per day or week makes me wish Blizzard had found a way to maybe combine just a couple of them. Also, everything is heavily time-gated, and it's difficult to see any reason to do this other than trying to keep you subscribed longer. At first, you can progress a decent amount week to week. But some of the later sanctum upgrades cost enough weekly or daily limited currencies that it's going to take months to unlock them, at minimum, and so far the rewards are really underwhelming. In Ardenweald, I’ve been given the job of nurturing specific souls to prepare them for reincarnation, a process that takes three real-time days each. The reward for doing this the first time, to my shock and dismay, was a stack of 12 cloth – something I could have farmed in about a half hour at most. The wait wouldn't be so bad if the rewards actually seemed worth it. Each of the eight new dungeons is pretty strong, both thematically and in terms of fun boss mechanics. In the Necrotic Wake, one fight requires you to trick a mad professor's abominable creations into hitting him with their meat hooks, dragging him down from his safe perch to do battle. In De Otha Side, you team up with Battle for Azeroth's memorable breakout star, the loa of death Bwonsamdi, to collect on some old debts and help him fend off a rival to his throne in what's both one of the most hectic and satisfying five-person fights WoW has given us in a while. The higher-end mythic difficulty versions of these bosses, in particular, are a blast with an experienced group. And while I haven't been able to mess around with Mythic+ yet as it was locked for the first two weeks, the fact that the weekly cache will now let you choose between three different rewards instead of being totally random seems like it will majorly help with the problem of feeling like you did a lot of work only to get a gear piece that's useless to you. The first raid, Castle Nathria, has only been out for about a day as I'm writing this, but I've already had a really fun, chill time chipping away at the first few bosses, including a blind bat who forces the party to play an elaborate game of hide and seek. The architecture and music are fantastic throughout, though it does seem to be a little bit too bright for a vampiric overlord's seat of power. And while I definitely don't want to spoil it, one of Nathria's most clever encounters sees the return of a dearly departed fan favorite character we haven't heard from in a long, long time. And I'm really hoping it's not the last we see of them this expansion.  Crafting has also gotten a welcome new lease on afterlife in Shadowlands, as it's directly tied to the system of player-made legendary armor. Each piece starts with a template that can only be made by a crafter of the appropriate specialization – blacksmiths for plate, tailors for cloth, and so on. You then get to pick which stats to apply to it using missives made by scribes, which both gives those players a new way to make money and feels so much better than trying to re-roll random stats until you finally get something you like.  The one part of this system I'm not thrilled about is the fact that you have to craft 15 copies of the lower-tier legendary base items before you can unlock the higher-tier ones, which just ends up flooding the auction house with those lesser pieces and making it very difficult to turn a profit on them. We'll see what happens to the prices as things stabilize, but I'm worried supply is always going to outpace demand and, with a high fixed material cost to even get started, legendary crafting will end up as more of a gold sink than an economic boon. The 10 levels you'll spend getting to know the Shadowlands definitely live up to the standard of quality I expect from Blizzard in terms of zone design, music, and affecting character moments. And at max level, this is probably the most compelling World of Warcraft's beckoning call to stick around has ever been, mainly because of Torghast and the chances it presents you to craft your own legendary items. But the fact remains that max-level play is designed to keep you around as long as possible with a limited amount of drip-fed story and repetitive daily and weekly activities, even if Shadowlands has more of them, and they're more fun, than any previous expansion. Don't get me wrong: this one ranks highly in the pantheon, up there with Legion and Wrath of the Lich King, partly because it makes some honest and substantial attempts to reinvent the tired endgame formula. I'm just still not sure if it goes far enough to hold my interest, and subscription dollars, in between the meatier story drops in major patches. "
283,Call of the Sea ,9.0,"All great puzzle games not only consist of lots of smaller problems to solve along the way, but one overarching conundrum to unpack on your journey. They take you to a mysterious place full of intrigue and the unknown, a place which by the end of your time there you’ve uncovered all of the secrets it held inside. The stunning island setting of Call of the Sea does exactly this as you’re led through each of its puzzle-laden areas, gradually revealing the answers to an engrossing story full to the brim with beauty and darkness. It’s clear from the get-go of this four to five-hour first-person adventure where its inspirations came from. The shadow of Lovecraft hangs heavy over the island, with echoes of other-worldly creatures and pearlescent “The Colour Out of Space” tones littering the landscape at times. Never does it descend into pure horror, though, and stays firmly put in the more dreamlike elements of the Lovecraftian spectrum, with aspects of Guillermo Del Toro’s work also present.  In particular, The Shape of Water appears to have a big influence throughout – romance, fantasy, and well, water are big themes here. It’s fundamentally about the lengths we’ll go to for the people we love. And like true love, Call of the Sea is reciprocal; the more you invest in its characters and story, the more gratification you’ll ultimately receive when choosing between its equally affecting and poignant endings.   Call of the Sea is not without a sense of adventure, though, and borrows heavily from the 19th-century novels of Jules Verne and H. G. Wells as you travel to a mysterious location and unearth its history as well as the remnants of an ancient civilization. There’s a genuine feeling of discovery as you follow in the tracks of your character’s explorer husband, Harry. You play as Norah, a woman suffering from an unexplained illness, the cure for which is the reason Harry ventured to the south Pacific in the first place. She’s expertly voiced by Cissy Jones (of Firewatch and The Walking Dead fame) who carries the story on her shoulders for almost all of its runtime with occasional support from Yuri Lowenthal (Marvel’s Spider-Man) as Harry. Similar to Firewatch, Call of the Sea has a personal story to tell with a healthy dose of mystery thrown in. It’s very well written on the whole and concisely tells its story through internal dialogue, letters, and painted murals without ever becoming confusing or dull. It’s in these internal thoughts, however, that some of the writing doesn’t hold up. It occasionally feels unnatural, with the obvious stated on more than one occasion. It didn’t detract too much from me enjoying the story as a whole, but did at times leave little to interpretation or genuine discovery and what felt like it could’ve been an enticing open mystery sometimes became an expedition in exposition instead. An adventure game is only as good as its puzzles, though, and in this regard Call of the Sea excels. As much as its story and aesthetic influences are clear to see, its gameplay is firmly rooted in classics such as the Myst series. Each chapter tends to have one large puzzle to solve in order to move onto the next area, and it’s surrounded by numerous smaller problems to solve in order to find the main solution.   They start off fairly basic but build in complexity as you move deeper into the heart of the island. Some conundrums share similar mechanics, whether that be translating symbols or pressing a series of disparate buttons in a correct order, but no two are identical. There’s a sense of progression in difficulty that goes hand-in-hand with the story, meaning the puzzles hit a real sweet spot for me and my head felt appropriately scratched. They were never so simple that I felt I wasn’t being challenged, but also never obtuse to the level of me being stumped. This is much appreciated, as with a story-heavy game such as this you never want your momentum to be slowed as you await the next plot developments. It’s a hard thing to balance, but Call of the Sea achieves this throughout. It constantly brings in surprising new mechanics and ways to move around its world. Each new set of puzzles brings a new set of ideas to the table whether on land, or occasionally, underwater. A favourite section of mine had me trying to bring an oversized dormant organ back to life and work out how to play the correct series of musical notes in order to proceed. There’s always a satisfying pay-off to these larger puzzles as well in the form of significant narrative advancements or pure visual spectacle. Each of these areas will have you travelling back and forth between locations in order to do things in the right order. This can become a little laborious over time, as Norah isn’t the fastest walker, and while you can move slightly quicker by “running” it isn’t enough of a speed boost to ease the pain.  What does make slowly strolling your way across the island and back more bearable is that there’s plenty of stunning scenery to take in. Each biome houses its own delights, whether that be the tropical tones of a bird-song filled clearing or the harsh crashes of waves set against lightning poetically cannoning off a shipwreck. No two areas feel the same, and indeed not all of them feel of our world, but they’re all attention grabbing in their own ways. The classic look of 1930s posters and postcards is infused into the art style and allows for colours to burst off of the screen.   This paradisiacal setting allows for the more foreboding and unusual architectural and artistic elements of the island to stand out more than they would do in a less naturally tranquil place. In essence it mirrors the themes and story of Call of the Sea perfectly; an experience packed with beauty and wonder that hides a dark mystery bubbling beneath its surface.  Developer Out of the Blue’s debut game is a gorgeous homage to the films and games that inspired it. Through engaging Myst-style puzzles and a captivating story, Call of the Sea triumphs in bringing its island alive, along with the characters that have explored it. It delivers a short-lived but engrossing experience through stunning art direction and an excellent voice cast, with the biggest of its minor annoyances being a slow movement speed. If a fun, but emotionally affecting adventure is what you’re searching for then Call of the Sea most definitely answers that call. "
284,Cyberpunk 2077 ,9.0, In my experience, great open-world RPGs like The Witcher 3 or Skyrim aren't defined by the strength of their main story, but that of the side missions around it. With Cyberpunk 2077, developer CD Projekt Red has taken that philosophy and built an entire game out of it. Apart from the surprisingly short but still utterly compelling central questline that draws you through its diverse near-future cityscape, the vast majority of what you can do in Night City is entirely optional but often still extremely impactful on your journey. This more freeform structure isn’t without its faults, including loads of distracting bugs, but the strength of the missions themselves – optional or not – and the choice you have within them make Cyberpunk 2077 one of the most exciting, emotional, and just plain fun RPGs I’ve played in recent years. You’re thrust into the shoes of V, a mercenary in Night City who (avoiding spoilers as much as I can) ends up with the psyche of long-dead rockstar and anti-corporate terrorist Johnny Silverhand trapped in their head. Johnny, played by the instantly recognizable Keanu Reeves, is a wonderfully dislikable jackass – even if, to be blunt, Reeves’ stiff performance is easily the weakest of an otherwise extremely impressive cast. Even still, Johnny’s confrontational relationship with V and the eventual growth between them is the anchor of this story as they fight to find a solution to the shared mess they find themselves in.  Once I got past Cyberpunk 2077’s slow burn of an intro – it initially took me six hours to even reach the moment where the logo is splashed across the screen for the first time – I was all in on this story. That opening segment is slightly restrictive relative to what comes later, but it does an incredible job of creating a sense of investment in V’s struggle, and then keeping that going as the main quests slowly dial up the heat. Once past the intro, you can go wherever you want on the sprawling map that is Night City; certain neighborhoods may have tougher enemies than others, but generally speaking no one’s going to shoot you on sight unless you go looking for trouble – and from the early hours you’ll already have enough side quests to keep you busy for a long time. The structure here feels very different from many RPGs I’ve played, including CD Projekt Red’s own The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. If most game structures are built like a redwood tree, with a tall central trunk that has paths branching off it as you go higher, Cyberpunk 2077 is more like a large bush: you don’t have to travel down its main quest very far at all to have dozens of tangled branches already within your reach, all competing for your attention. Most are just a phone conversation away, too: since this is the future, you often don’t even have to go looking for quest givers because people will just call to offer you a job. This does somewhat rob Cyberpunk 2077 of a familiar feeling of scaling growth, since the options available to you increase rapidly and then plateau a bit for most of your playtime, but there’s so much to see and do – and still so much not directly handed to you that must be sought out – that I didn’t mind trading in that style of discovery for one of abundant choice. And while the single, unrestricted urban map means you won’t get that “wow” feeling of traveling to an exciting new open world location at any point, Night City is so dense, diverse, and consistently beautiful that there are opportunities to stumble upon unexpected sights all the time within it – for example, I played for nearly 40 hours before I discovered there’s practically an entire forest hidden under one of the busiest interchanges in town. You’ll be sent through slums, fancy corporate towers, dusty deserts, lush greeneries, and even some weirder places that are better discovered for yourself. The scale and scope of Night City is simply stunning, and driving around marveling at everything it has to offer – from the massive skyscrapers to the immaculately detailed in-world advertisements that plaster them – is frequently rewarding on its own. In fact, while there is a fast-travel system that gradually unlocks as you visit new areas, I almost felt bad about using it on anything but the longest trips. Driving manually means you’ll never see a load screen and lets you soak in the sights along the way. There’s some real variety in the feel and design of its cars too, each with a detailed interior that matches the depth of the city around them. And while you’re constantly being offered special cars for sale, all of which can then be called to you with the press of a button, some of the coolest options I won’t spoil are unique rides only unlocked through your actions in specific missions.  Night City is the kind of place where if you move through it too quickly you’ll miss half of what it has to offer. But don’t let the first-person perspective and guns-blazing futuristic combat fool you: Cyberpunk 2077 feels like an RPG through and through. It’s frequently a slow-paced game full of rich, beautifully presented conversations and an almost mind-boggling amount of choices to make – choice in dialogue options, how to build your character, how to approach missions, and beyond. I’d frequently reload saves to see how certain situations could have played out if I’d done something different, and what I found impressed me almost every time. Cyberpunk 2077 lets your choices have a massive impact on both V’s own story and those of the characters around them. At one point I made a recommendation to a character at the end of a mission, and the next time I saw him I found out he had lost his job as a result – that wasn’t a fail state, as there was plenty more to do with him after, but knowing that his fate might look very different in someone else’s game where they’d picked a different choice made my playthrough feel more personal. Similarly, I was shocked to discover one of my favorite missions early on wasn’t even offered to another player because of a single decision we’d made differently. I was also floored when multiple decisions I made during a mission mere hours into the story massively changed the outcome of an unrelated one more than 25 hours later. I’d unwittingly turned what could have been an all-out gunfight into a friendly conversation. The missions themselves are also largely delightful, ranging from hilarious to deeply emotional to thrilling to intensely dark. I don’t want to rob you of the experience of finding them yourself, but vague highlights for me range from the gorgeous parade CDPR has already shown off in trailers, to a series of gumshoe-style detective missions where the amount of evidence you actively seek out can have massive repercussions on the results (including one that was so grim it felt like playing out an episode of Criminal Minds). I don’t think I’ll forget a deeply touching scuba diving mission anytime soon, or befriending a goofy AI-controlled vending machine named Brendan. The fact that Cyberpunk 2077 is able to have deep, affecting moments alongside lighthearted goofs and blaring ads for things like “MILFguard” (itself an Easter egg pun on The Witcher’s Nilfgaard, though sex and nudity are an almost mundane part of Night City) without any of it feeling out of place is a testament to the strength of both its stories and the world they take place in. The depth and variation available throughout most of these is genuinely hard to wrap my head around. You have to understand that in Cyberpunk 2077, just because something is a side mission doesn’t mean it’s not important to the story. This may come as a shock to anyone who has played CDPR’s previous Witcher games, especially The Witcher 3, but when I was mainlining the story it only took me around 20 hours to beat. That said, that only gave me access to three distinct endings, all of which were enjoyable but offered less control over the outcome than I would have expected. It was only after reloading a save from before the point of no return and spending another 20 hours playing through side missions, falling in love with characters, and leaving more of a mark on Night City that I went back to finish the story once again only to find my options had been massively expanded through my actions. After putting roughly 45 hours into Cyberpunk 2077, I was able to beat it seven different ways, including three drastically different final missions and five wildly different but satisfying endings after them (plus one similar one) – and I still have plenty more to do and lots of mysteries to hunt down. The more time you put in, the richer the payoff you’ll get in the end. This is the crux of what’s so impressive about Cyberpunk 2077. It’s not a Rubix Cube to be solved in an optimal way but with different routes to get there: it’s a Rorschach Test. It’s shorter than the epic-length quest you might’ve expected, but with an amount of variation that’s almost impossible to keep track of, so whatever you think you see in that inkblot is what you’re going to get out of it. There are no wrong answers here and nothing forcing you to play more or less than you want to. It offers you a marvelous amount of control as a player. That said, this structure does misfire slightly in how it’s organized and presented. The mission log itself is a big messy list with no clear indications of what different tasks will reward you with or which optional jobs might be more pertinent to V and Johnny’s story than others. It’s primarily broken into “Main Jobs” that are required to progress, “Gigs” that offer amusing but quick and inconsequential bites of action and story, and a “Side Jobs” category that basically houses everything else, be it an important but optional piece of plot, a date with a side character, or just a series of bare-knuckle boxing matches. What’s frustrating here is that since all these Side Jobs are clumped together and optional, at a certain point I was at a loss as to how else I could impact the larger story and see more endings. Part of that confusion comes from the three percentage trackers in the main menu, each relating to different aspects of V’s journey. While they are primarily increased through Main Jobs, some Side Jobs (but not all) could also occasionally move the needle as well. These ended up being fairly misleading to me, since the first time I finished the story they were at 90/25/40%, respectively. The issue here is that they are presented like numbers that reflect my progress toward individual goals, but don't actually function that way in practice. To be clear, I loved pretty much every single job I did, but these percentages mixed with Cyberpunk 2077’s freeform mission structure created a false and frustrating sense that I was failing to make progress even as I completed missions, with no indication of how to fix that. Once I understood the system more clearly that frustration subsided a bit, though individual mission chains can still occasionally feel somewhat disjointed at times – like you’re playing through different movies that will then maybe affect the Avengers-esque culmination of V’s journey later on. But when taken as a whole, what Cyberpunk 2077 is doing here is pretty remarkable. Apart from a few recurring anchor points, different players could end up seeing wildly different versions of V’s story, twisting and breaking away from each other in ways that still feel entirely natural.  While that mission structure is undoubtedly the most interesting way Cyberpunk 2077 gives you control, there are also some good old-fashion RPG decisions to be made in terms of how you choose to kill (or politely incapacitate) those standing in your way. There isn’t any sort of traditional class system; instead, you invest points into five primary attributes, and then into perks within each of those for more specialized improvements. For example, if you’re planning to sneak through dangerous situations, the Cool attribute can make enemies detect you slower (I’m not sure why, but let’s just roll with it) and the Stealth perk page within that attribute is then full of additional boons to unlock, like increasing your crouched movement speed or unlocking an aerial takedown. What’s great about this system is that these attributes and perks generally felt like they were only enhancing whatever playstyle I wanted to lean into, not punishing me for not investing in something else. Not having enough points in Body might make it harder to wield certain heavy weapons or mean you can’t bust open a few doors, but you can still effectively use shotguns even if you don’t invest in its Assault perk to make them stronger. In fact, each perk can level up through natural use – so if you put all your points in Intelligence to be a hacking master, but 10 hours in realize you’re really enjoying stealth, your Stealth perk will improve on its own somewhat whether you’ve invested in it or not. As with most things in Cyberpunk 2077, this system is wonderfully flexible and consistently rewarding, if a touch overwhelming in just how many options you have. Combat itself is another aspect where you’ll largely get more out of it the more you put in. Like I said, despite how it looks in action, this is truly an RPG and not a first-person shooter. While I initially wasn’t in love with the gunplay because of its unexpectedly bullet spongy enemies and surprisingly quick damage drop-off at distance, it only got better the deeper I went. Perks let you improve those problems in statistical ways, but what really made the combat shine is when I started finding more unique weaponry and clever cybernetic augmentations that elevated things above simply pointing and shooting. Some guns can charge up and shoot through walls, and I invested in perks that made them both charge faster and hit harder. Alternatively, another player could lean into Smart weapons that cause bullets to seek out enemies. Add equippable Cyberware like the ability to slow time when you dodge while aiming, a double jump, or the savage Mantis blades, and things really start to get interesting.  I've only been able to play the PC version of Cyberpunk 2077 so far, but it's launching on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (and Google Stadia) alongside it. It's important to be aware that while backward compatibility allows you to play those versions on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and naturally take advantage of their faster GPUs and SSDs, there won't be official next-gen-optimized versions or upgrades for those platforms until sometime next year. CDPR hasn't said exactly when those will arrive, so you should keep that in mind if you're looking to play Cyberpunk 2077 on one of your shiny new systems this year.  I wouldn’t say that combat ever becomes overly deep in the moment, especially the fun but fairly mashy melee options, but I (once again) had so much flexibility and control that I could constantly keep things fresh and entertaining for myself. I loved opening a fight by stealthily marking enemies then going to another room to blast at their outlines through a wall, switching to a powerful pistol for precise headshots as they tracked me down, then swapping again to my Mantis Blades to rush down the last few, all the while lobbing different elemental grenades and popping healing items behind cover when I needed to. It’s not the most complex dance in the world, but it’s one I felt I had complete control over choreographing. I also love Cyberpunk 2077’s solution for handling its unique Iconic weapons, which are generally awarded through missions and have distinct attributes and twists to set them apart from typical loot – things like the Chaos pistol that changes its elemental damage type every time you reload, the Overwatch sniper rifle that comes with a custom silencer, or… a dildo club called the Sir John Phallustiff. The clever part here is that, in addition to getting the item itself, you also get a crafting recipe for it (I rarely used the crafting and upgrade options across the 60+ total hours I've played, but there are whole perks dedicated to them for those who want to dig in deep). Through these, you can replace an Iconic weapon with a better version of itself as you progress, keeping your favorites relevant the whole way through the campaign. Some even have custom display spots in V’s apartment, giving completionists a visible reward even when not in use – though it is a little odd that the vast majority of the Iconic weapons I’ve found so far seem to be either pistols or katanas, causing a bit of awkward overlap. Between the increased number of available weapons and ability upgrades, by the midpoint of my playtime I enjoyed going loud when I had to, but almost always tried to stealth through certain situations first if I could. Cyberpunk 2077’s level design is frequently a playground of decisions to make, be that finding which hidden entrance to quietly enter or which door to kick down and start firing through for maximum effect. There are tons of valuable items to pick up tucked into hidden corners, as well as computer consoles that can be accessed to turn off security cameras, open doors, or read emails that might offer clues to other things in the area. So while the stealth itself isn’t much more complex than crouch-walking out of sight and occasionally doing quiet takedowns, I loved puzzling out the best route and then using Quickhacks to mess with guards along the way. Quickhacking is Cyberpunk 2077’s way of blending hacking into its stealth and combat, letting you essentially pause time to use equippable viruses that can deal damage, mark enemies through walls, or even blind or deafen them temporarily. The enemy AI is fairly easy to manipulate at the best of times, but using hacks to quietly get through tougher areas or disable a stronger target mid-fight was always an awesome feeling regardless. That hack-stealth combo was my go-to playstyle, and with it I was able to complete some missions without ever drawing a weapon. There was one in particular that would have likely been a large, bloody base raid for a different kind of character, but thanks to my V’s high Technical Ability and a hidden shortcut I managed to find I never even saw a single guard on my way in or out. When things do get loud though, a special commendation needs to be given to Cyberpunk 2077’s soundtrack. The music here is fantastic throughout, with radio stations full of custom songs made by in-universe artists singing about the struggles of Night City like it was a real place, but the combat music stands out even in that company. It often drove the pace of firefights directly, pushing me forward and frequently making me bob my head to the beat as I leapt at people with Mantis Blades or shot them through their cover. A few choice sequences became truly memorable moments thanks to their soundtracks alone.  Unfortunately, the amount of bugs I’ve experienced really does need to be mentioned. I’ve only been able to play Cyberpunk 2077 on a PC with a GeForce RTX 3080 GPU, and as of writing this I have yet to lay hands on either the PlayStation or Xbox versions, but the issues I’ve encountered were extremely frequent and distracting. Performance on Ultra settings at 1080p with ray tracing off was largely okay for me, as you’d hope would be the absolute bare minimum on a brand-new and still-hard-to-get graphics card, generally only noticeably dropping in framerate while driving around busy areas or in certain weather conditions – but it was the routinely messed up animations, missing models, and glitchy dialogue that really got to me. I’ve had important or emotional conversations undermined by the characters I was talking to glitching between incorrect poses, or the objects they were holding and referencing not load in at all. I’d frequently get phone calls in the middle of other conversations, causing two simultaneous discussions to overlap. I’ve had to sit through drives with my camera distractingly bobbing like I was in a run animation, and seen enemies (or even my own shadow on a wall) stuck in T-poses. And in the few important story moments you do get to see your own character model, I rarely had hair for some reason. Again, none of this stopped me from completing any significant quest (though I did have to reload saves in smaller missions a couple times due to bugs hindering progress) or from loving the stories being told, but it was still ridiculous and distracting, dampening a few moments that would otherwise have been powerful. A day-one patch will arrive after the time of this review, but CDPR has indicated it will focus on stability and performance – which is always good, but frankly those aren’t the issues that’ve been bothering me the most. To be fair, with its exceptional support of The Witcher 3, CDPR has absolutely earned a lot of faith that it will stick with Cyberpunk 2077 and continue to patch out these problems. But especially with that in mind, this does feel very much like a game that will be significantly more polished if you play six months or a year from now than it is today. Just to restate, a word of warning: we haven’t been able to play the console versions of Cyberpunk 2077 at all – not on the new-gen systems or the old. While I’d wholeheartedly recommend it on its gameplay merits, given the performance issues I’ve seen even with a high-end PC GPU, I am wary of what it’ll look like running on something like a launch Xbox One or PlayStation 4. If that’s where you intend to play, I recommend waiting until we can provide you with some gameplay footage from those systems before you make your decision. Cyberpunk 2077 kicks you into its beautiful and dazzlingly dense cityscape with few restrictions. It offers a staggering amount of choice in how to build your character, approach quests, and confront enemies, and your decisions can have a tangible and natural-feeling impact on both the world around you and the stories of the people who inhabit it. Those stories can be emotional, funny, dark, exciting, and sometimes all of those things at once. The main quest may be shorter than expected when taken on its own and it’s not always clear what you need to do to make meaningful changes to its finale, but the multitude of side quests available almost from the start can have a surprisingly powerful effect on the options you have when you get there. It’s a shame that frustratingly frequent bugs can occasionally kill an otherwise well-set mood, but Cyberpunk 2077’s impressively flexible design makes it a truly remarkable RPG. "
285,Haven ,8.0, Support is essential in healthy relationships because no matter how turbulent shared lives can be, your partner is always there to offer a steady hand. Haven weaves that affection into a beautiful science-fiction RPG about the misadventures of two star-crossed lovers. Whether I was joyfully catching ethereal waves on anti-gravity boots, blitzing alien critters during exciting turn-based battles, or just zesting up meals, it was delightful witnessing its protagonists’ adorable relationship bleed into every activity. And those highs hit that much harder in the brilliant co-op mode. But every healthy relationship means being willing to put up with faults, and in Haven’s case that means turning a blind eye to long stretches of mandatory, monotonous resource gathering across barren landscapes.   This is no Death Stranding-style exploration game, though, because Yu and Kay sport anti-gravity boots that would blow Sam Porter Bridges’ mind. These miracles of athletic wear-meets-airliner let you glide across hayfields or soar into the high heavens. When they're juiced-up, that is; Source has peculiar energy tendrils called flow threads all over its surface, and they charge the boots to allow you to access hard-to-reach areas. Riding these threads is like surfing – matching the flow's trajectory is critical to avoid wiping out. From the get-go, I had a blast fishtailing on flow arcs, unsure of where a thread might take me but excited about what could potentially be at the destination. Sometimes, the path would lead to patches of rare berries ripe for the picking or, better yet, remnants from past explorers no longer in need of collectible doodads they left laying around.   What's slightly more involved yet still miraculously dull as dirt is cleaning rust, a sludgy purple toxin covering most of the land. Cleaning involves brainlessly flying over corrupted areas, soaking up rust like a Roomba that's regretting whatever life choices led it to this moment. You do this ad nauseam until every single solitary blade of grass is spotless, which wouldn't be so bad if it was only a requirement once in a blue moon. However, there are over 40 zones to comb through, with most drenched in rust. You can't ignore these chores despite how boring they are, either, as both food and rust are crucial to progression. Did we learn nothing from the chore-like mining of resources in Mass Effect 2?While I spent the overwhelming majority of Haven’s roughly 15 hours in single-player, its creative local co-op mode etched out a decent chunk of my time, too. When you’re each controlling one character, decision making and combat actions are split straight down the middle between yourself and (hopefully) someone special. Sharing laughter with a loved one over what dialogue options to choose or which fork in the road to take is an utter joy. Sure, the shared camera can get a bit wonky if one of you strolls right while the other insists on going left, but it's only an issue during exploration.  What sets Haven apart from so many other games about romance is it's not about the pursuit of love. By the time we meet Yu and Kay, they're already together. And without getting into spoilers, they've gone to hell and back for the life they now share. I couldn't help but see past relationships of mine reflected in their spur-of-the-moment interactions that pop up no matter what you're doing. It's relatable stuff. Kay roasts himself to make Yu giggle, whereas Yu coaxes out whatever might be bothering Kay a moment later. They fight, too. Every couple fights, after all. But even then, the two of them grow from it. Because despite how overpowering these feelings can be, if both parties work for it, love always prevails.  With an unusual approach to roleplaying games that focuses on the relationship of its protagonist couple as not just the story but also its mechanics, Haven stands out from every other sci-fi adventure I’ve played. Were it not for soul-crushingly tedious rust cleaning and hillside foraging taking up so much of the campaign's runtime, Haven might've cemented itself as an all-time great RPG. However, the thrilling flow-rides, harmonious combat, thematically appropriate take on co-op, and startlingly human relationship between its leads make up for any low points. Above all else, Haven proves that love conquers all. "
286,Empire of Sin ,4.0, WW1 vet-turned-mob enforcer Hugh Miller has fallen head-over-heels in love with another gangster, Tammy Trucco. The next firefight they and the rest of my squad get into, Tammy eats a bullet; boom, dead. Reeling from that and a recent demotion, Hugh has had enough to outweigh his strong sense of loyalty and he quits my gang in a huff. It’s a dramatic moment that underscores what Empire of Sin does best: Well-written, complex personal relationships, both positive and negative, that develop between your crew of criminal soldiers and make this management and tactical strategy game work.   For what it’s worth, Empire of Sin really embraces the Roaring ‘20s style, showing off Chicago streets that are initially fun to navigate and a roaring soundtrack of jazz mixed with some more modern pieces. The writing and weird cast of characters, both fictional and fictionalized alike, have a lot of charm. There's even really delightfully over-the-top voice acting for nearly every character, littered with standout performances like gangster boss Frankie Donovan, aged Western sharpshooter Grover Monks, or the hammy duo performance of a gambling bookie and a button man. (They're in love.) The charm wore off a lot quicker than I’d have liked, though.  The tactical battles are built on good bones: Gangsters have a to-hit stat, hit points, and you find weapons with varied stats. Basic combat numbers are pretty granular, with health in the 50-150 range, so a thug might take two to four pistol shots to go down. It's just enough randomness to make the weapon stats and upgraded rarities really matter. There's also a half-or-full-cover system you'll recognize from every tactics game since 2012, well implemented here, with angle of attack and distance mattering depending on what weapon you're using: a shotgun does best from within two tiles, a rifle from seven or more, and a submachine gun is happiest somewhere in the middle. There are balance issues, like one-hit kills from sniper rifles and surprise damage from unavoidable dynamite attacks, but there's fun at the tactical core.  It's the maps that really kill the combat. They're pretty, at least, thanks to locations like dim speakeasy interiors and luxurious gambling houses, but they’re chokepointed, poorly laid out, and offer very little tactical variety. Most fights end up revolving around a single corner or doorway as you set up a kill zone and watch enemies swarm into it – and many of the maps only have one or two of those chokepoints to fight over. The terrain is static as well: there’s no destruction, and no interesting ways for characters to get around. It's an honest crime that you can't vault over the bar counters into cover like in every gangster movie ever.  You can, in theory, play many ways, such as diplomatically catering to allies and placating opponents as you build up your empire, but those are never the best idea. Why would you wait for your cash reserves to build – and I mean literally wait, since the management layer is real-time and has a single speed – in order to wage a full-scale gang war when you can just directly attack enemies and take everything they have in one fight? iframe allowautoplay="""" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/gallery/41918/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery41918"" scrolling=""no""> Part of the issue with the strategy layer is that while the city is nice to look at, getting your characters to where you need them to be becomes a major chore. Your characters control in real time on the streets, and you order them around like units in an RTS until combat starts. They're slow to react, slow to move, and frustratingly bad at pathfinding, requiring constant hand-holding. This makes attacking enemies building-by-building frustrating and boring: You move from place to place and attack, fight the same three or four guards on the same three or four maps, then take over the building.  Fights might be more fun if you could afford more gangsters and more security upgrades for your rackets, but you really can't. The economics are so poorly balanced that amassing any large amount of cash is really only possible once you’ve already built a huge empire of rackets, and even then you burn through it buying just a handful of incremental upgrades. Think spending $3,000 dollars for… +7% on a building's income of $500. Woohoo, only 85 in-game weeks before I break even! That's just a mere... hour and a half of my life. (One game speed, remember?) The interface, by the way, is truly terrible for managing a huge empire. You can own dozens of businesses but there's no single screen to manage them all at once. Instead, you get to sort through them neighborhood-by-neighborhood on screens that also have all your competitors' businesses. To upgrade them, you must open a new screen for each business, one at a time. I eventually resorted to simply building new businesses, ignoring all upgrades, and hoping that quantity had a quality all its own. Thankfully, that worked.  Sure, those safehouse fights can be hard, but the tactical AI is bad enough that with a decent crew you'll quickly snowball totally out of the enemy's control. Once you’ve got a grip on the mechanics, the only thing that'll hold you back is bugs and bad game balance. Sometimes your characters will just up and vanish. Sometimes an enemy will turn out to have a really cool and overpowered special ability – like, say, mind-control drugs – or toss a bundle of dynamite that kills half your team before you can even act. Sometimes you'll lose a fight to that power, reload the save for another go, and that same enemy just… won't bother to use the ability this time. The breaking point for me, though, was the cops. Not once was I ever harassed or attacked by the police or federal agents outside of a scripted mission. At one point I was literally slaughtering beat cops in the streets just to see if I could provoke a reaction of any kind. I could not. It’s as if the system you’d expect to control their behavior simply doesn’t exist.    It's a shame, because the glimmers of a great game are here. Take your crew: The network of thugs-for-hire in your black book all have morale and loyalty scores, their own specific background traits, personalities, and relationships to the other gangsters. It's the first game to implement this system so well since Jagged Alliance 2 (which I'll note was also written by Brenda Romero). They get mad or worried when their lover is injured, and they won't shoot a friend on the other side of a fight. They can gain new relationships in play, become alcoholics, or get syphilis. Gangsters can die permanently, too, which is fun to avoid once someone becomes integral to your crew. Push them far enough and they'll leave your gang. But even with all of that promise, Empire of Sin’s many faults have pushed me too far. All the good ideas and strong 1920s atmosphere in Empire of Sin amount to nothing in the end. The tactical combat has strong bones and some clever design, but fails to live up to its promise due to repetitive, lackluster maps and wildly unbalanced abilities. The strategy layer is shallow and the many ways to roleplay feel meaningless when there is a clear easiest path to victory and the rest are so tedious. The criminal enterprise management is poorly balanced and tediously slow due to a combination of game speed and bad interface. Top it all off with bugs, glitches, and janky performance issues too numerous to mention and you have a game that's just not worth your time unless it gets a major overhaul. "
287,Twin Mirror ,5.0, After waking up in a hotel room early on in Twin Mirror, your shirt covered in blood and the memories of the previous night’s events shrouded in fog, developer Dontnod’s latest adventure initially seems less like a whodunnit and more like a you done it. Unfortunately, that’s about as suspenseful things ever get. While there’s no shortage of intrigue at its outset, Twin Mirror’s lean running time leaves little room to flesh out all the characters in its small town setting or introduce any form of misdirection to its mystery, robbing the reveals in its closing chapters of any real weight or surprise as a result.   I found the escalating friction between Sam and his hallucinated other half to be far more interesting than any of the other character interactions in Twin Mirror. So much of the supporting cast is painted in the broadest of strokes and you’re only afforded small windows of opportunity to get to know them. It also doesn’t help that both the acting and motion capture seem noticeably stiff in this post-The Last of Us Part 2 era, or that there’s often no tonal consistency between individual conversations. At one point I managed to annoy a local coffee shop owner by cutting her off in the middle of a conversation, and when I opened a new dialogue with her immediately afterwards she acted as though we hadn’t spoken in years, which shattered the moment-to-moment illusion that my inputs were having much of an effect on my surroundings.  Speaking of shattered illusions, at times Sam will retreat from reality into his “mind palace,” a dreamlike realm where shimmering crystalline shards arrange themselves into fragments of Sam’s memory. At first these sections seem like a safe haven, but as Sam’s anxiety intensifies over the course of his investigation they soon transform into nightmarish voids. These sections are constructed with clumsy chase sequences and overly simplistic environmental puzzles, but their atmosphere at least introduces a welcome jolt of trepidation to Twin Mirror’s otherwise fairly sedate mood. I felt a greater pull to explore in this otherworldly expanse than I did poking around the sleepy town of Basswood, so I was disappointed that I was so rarely given the chance. Sam’s mind palace can also be used as a tool on the handful of occasions you need to reconstruct the sequence of events at a crime scene. At the site of Nick’s car accident, for example, you’re able to adjust a set of variables like whether Nick was drunk or sober, and whether he swerved to miss an animal or a fallen tree, and then watch how each permutation plays out. Although there’s always a variety of conclusions to arrive at, only one of them is ever the correct one that will advance the story, meaning that these crime scene recreations are less about drawing your own conclusion as they are arbitrarily swapping around their individual components until you get it right. While I was disappointed at the lack of any real deduction required, at least I felt some agency during these reconstructive sequences. The same can’t really be said for Twin Mirror’s evidence gathering, which for the most part amounts to shuffling around a given location, pixel-hunting for any white button prompts that indicate interactivity, and gradually ticking them all off before you can trigger the crime scene reconstruction. While there are a couple of exceptions that require at least half a moment of contemplation – scouring an office for the combination to a safe, for example – these investigations for the most part just involve clicking on everything you come across while Sam mumbles observations with all the wit and insight of a teenager’s tweets.  Possibly the only major surprise I uncovered in Twin Mirror is its apparent reverence for Pac-Man. The classic arcade pellet-chomper from the ‘80s is everywhere you look in the opening hours. There’s a Pac-Man arcade machine in Sam’s mind palace, there’s a Pac-Man arcade machine in cherished photos, there’s the Pac-Man character recreated by post-it notes on the wall of the local newspaper office and, I’m happy to report, there’s a fully playable Pac-Man arcade machine in the local pub. Oddly enough, there are also clear parallels to be made between Pac-Man and Sam. Sam spends a lot of his time wandering around in all directions looking for white dots, a lot like Pac-Man. Sam depends on pills in order to help him confront the ghosts of his past, a lot like Pac-Man. If Sam tries to leave the confines of an investigation area he immediately returns to the same area, a lot like Pac-Man. And if you feel like I’m reaching too much with this analogy, consider this: in an early flashback Sam’s friend Nick straight up tells Sam that he's “a lot like Pac-Man.” I don’t know how much of Pac-Man’s pizza-shaped presence is by design or purely coincidental, but what I do know is that I spent far more time puzzling over why the developers seemingly drew so much inspiration from a forty-year-old arcade icon when crafting their modern story-driven psychological thriller than I spent analysing the actual plot. That may have been because Twin Mirror’s central murder mystery is exceedingly straightforward, low on surprises and staggeringly small in scope. I played through the story twice, making different decisions each time, and although the second ending revealed slightly more than the first, both arrived at unfulfilling and entirely predictable conclusions that didn’t even come close to blowing the doors off my mind palace. Apparently Twin Mirror was originally conceived as a three-part episodic series before such plans were scrapped in favour of producing a single standalone story, but what’s actually here ultimately feels like a season of television that jumps from the third episode straight to the season finale. It just doesn’t allow enough time to build any story momentum, develop its characters enough, or ratchet up the suspense. Twin Mirror is a frustratingly uneven adventure; it feels slow-paced yet ends too quickly, it features a wide cast of characters but doesn’t give them enough depth, and it presents you with crimes to investigate without letting you play much of a role in solving them. The back and forth between Sam and his double provides the odd enjoyably tense moment, and the mind palace sections at least provide a change of pace, but the overarching narrative doesn’t so much as gradually ramp up to a startling climax as skid and thud into a clearly signposted deadend. Outside of the eccentric influence of Pac-Man, the biggest surprise in Twin Mirror was that it left me with so little to reflect on. "
288,Immortals Fenyx Rising ,7.0, In Greek mythology, Icarus’s ambition led to his literal downfall when he flew too close to the sun and melted his wax wings. So yes, being overly ambitious does have its drawbacks, but so too does a lack of it. Immortals Fenyx Rising, for instance, offers a light and entertaining spin on Greek mythology that’s clearly inspired by a reverence for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Its setting, systems, and story are packed with references to iconic deities and legendary tales, but always with tongue planted firmly enough in cheek that it avoids coming off as self-important. All this flavour makes for a great set-up that’s complemented by fun combat, but the puzzle design across this colourful open world is disappointingly workmanlike. In a game about heavenly gods and fantastical monsters, the puzzles are far too grounded by earthly concerns. Immortals’ most inventive touch is its storytelling. The journey of Fenyx, a mortal soldier shipwrecked on a mystical island, is presented as a tale told by an imprisoned Prometheus to Zeus, and the dynamic between the two is hilarious. The pair’s bantering narration interjects regularly throughout your roughly 30-hour adventure, helping to further the plot, provide mythological context, or simply crack jokes. And further on, Immortals does an effective job of balancing the focus on humour with story-driven character development.  The overarching story revolves around the hulking monstrosity Typhon, once imprisoned by Zeus, now free and determined to destroy the Gods forever. Typhon also interjects regularly as you travel across the Golden Isle setting, as he’s none too happy that you’re helping out the four gods this beast has transformed – Aphrodite, Hephaistos, Ares and Athena. And when I say transformed, I'm not embellishing. The God of War, for instance, is now a rather handsome rooster. The emphasis here is very much on humour, while also giving us insight into the backstories of Aphrodite, Hephaistos, Ares, and Athena within the pantheon. Hermes – emissary of the gods and all-round trickster – is also great value, popping up unexpectedly during missions, and always available at the Hall of the Gods, Immortals’ hub for upgrades and crafting. These are by no means the only characters of myth and legend covered by Immortals. Many of the puzzles, whether they're about restoring a Constellation or completing a Fresco are also references to classic fables, alongside other nods throughout the world.  Obviously the more intimately you know these myths and mythical beings the more you’ll get out of the references and the ways in which Immortals deals with them. I enjoyed the fact that the lives of the Gods are basically presented as a cosmic soap opera, but at the same time, a lot of it washed over me as I’m just not familiar enough with the underlying mythology. It would have been nice if Immortals had some supplemental information for players like myself that could help fill in the gaps along the way. The Gods are far from the only sources of humour in Immortals. Fenyx is treated quite playfully too, ensuring that even routine things like opening treasure chests or upgrading an attribute brought a smile to my face. The Golden Isle is a pretty alluring destination. Immortals’ painterly presentation can be quite striking as you gallop through lush meadows or take in the sights from a clifftop, while the day/night cycle ensures the tone of the landscape is always evolving. Fenyx is very capable within this world too; like Link in Breath of the Wild, he or she (you can choose) is able to climb basically any obstacle given enough stamina, then glide towards whatever destination you’ve picked out using the Wings of Daedalus. Exploration, though, is where Immortals stumbles a bit relative to its obvious inspiration. Fenyx’s Far Sight ability diminishes the joy of discovery somewhat, reducing it to a mechanical process of climbing to a vista, scanning the world, and marking out collectables and challenges – whether they’re visible or not. This takes a lot of the mystery out of the world.  It’s one thing, after all, to climb a peak and spot something in the distance, then drop a pin on it to remind yourself to go and see what it is. It’s quite another to be able to systematically work your way across the entire map waiting for controller vibrations, then mark exactly what’s in that spot – be it a treasure chest, Vault of Tartaros or one of the numerous challenge archetypes. Every time I used Far Sight I’d typically add ten or more new destinations on my map with next to no effort. To be honest, I’d much prefer not to know what’s in that deep chasm before I jump down to explore it. And likewise, I want to climb a craggy cliff jutting out of the sea just to see if there’s something up there, not because I know for a fact a shimmering nugget of Ambrosia is waiting. Despite this, The Golden Isle is still fun to roam around, with basic collectables to gather and discover, plenty of optional combat, and some truly impressive vistas.  Regardless, many of the destinations in Immortals aren’t what I’d describe as riveting once you reach them. It’s not that these challenges are bad – they just have no ambition whatsoever. That murky chasm I mentioned earlier? Turns out its deep secret was a puzzle where I had to shoot flaming arrows into three braziers to open a door. Then, 20 metres further along, I had to find three switches to open another door. Then a bit on from that, there was a puzzle where I had to find three weights to put on three pressure plates to open yet another door. I’m not even kidding. A large percentage of the puzzles in Immortals revolve around cookie-cutter gameplay like this. Immortals is grounded in pushing, pulling, lifting, stacking and throwing blocks… most of the time to trigger switches on the ground. That school of puzzle design is so old-school it makes the Greek myths feel practically contemporary. dir=""ltr""   To be clear, none of these are badly designed, and I didn’t actively dislike doing them. I just wasn’t excited by them, nor did they really test me or surprise me. Less would most definitely have been more in Immortals. Coming back to that chasm again, imagine if instead of three obvious and functionally similar puzzles there was just one that really rewarded observation and understanding its systems? I’d much prefer one satisfying puzzle that demands invention and lateral thinking than three utterly bland solutions. Instead, it feels as though the puzzles are largely there to fill the map, not to engage us. dir=""ltr""  Combat is absolutely a strength in Immortals, and the world map is positively littered with foes to fight, so any time I felt like letting off steam, some stylish hacking, slashing and wielding the powers of the Gods was never far away. I loved swapping my armour and weapons around to use their perks, as well as unlocking new abilities to give me more options in combat. Instead of doing that, I chose to complement my chosen skills by giving my bird sidekick Phosphoros the ability to swoop down to damage and stun a target repeatedly, which was great for big threats. I also upgraded Hephaistos’ Hammer to give it a shockwave for crowd control in addition to burst damage. Whatever way you like to fight, Immortals will likely have something for you. The combat is certainly fun, but it’s not particularly hard unless you decide to try and take on a legendary encounter before gearing up enough. For normal encounters it didn’t take me long to suss out each enemy’s attack patterns, as well as learning that if an enemy flashes red, I should get ready to dodge out of the way. Immortals has some good systems in place to help in combat too, such as icons showing when attacks are coming from off-screen. Again, get ready to dodge. Annoyingly, I found it impossible to consistently stay locked on to my priority target, so in the end opted not to use that functionality at all. dir=""ltr""  Another element that makes the combat feel easier than it might otherwise have been is the fact that your health bar doesn’t really mean much. If you spend any time gathering collectable plants in the environment, you’ll always be able to cook up enough health, stamina, attack boost and defense boost potions that you can spend them very freely. Only Immortals’ final boss had me down to zero health potions and legitimately sweating. For everything else I was able to dose up as needed. Even so, I’m not opposed to combat that isn’t overtly challenging if it’s still fun, and Immortals’ combat is very much that. Fenyx is responsive to control and felt more and more powerful as I progressed. And after clocking Immortals, I was pretty tempted to either go back to my pre-final boss save or to start a New Game+ and try to max out all Fenyx’s gear and abilities… but then I remembered the gameplay in between the combat and the exploration.  Wild fact: Immortals Fenyx Rising is Ubisoft's third open-world game to launch in just over a month. On October 29 we got Watch Dogs: Legion, which was followed by Assassin's Creed Valhalla less than two weeks later on November 10. That was only three weeks ago. Immortals Fenyx Rising gives us a gorgeous world to explore, filled with mythological beasts, deities, and powers to wield. Its combat is satisfying, with plenty of choice in upgrades, while its central characters, comedic tone, and storytelling are a real highlight. Seeing Fenyx’s saga through to the end, with amusing commentary from Zeus, Prometheus, and other gods along the way, is a treat. Its Achilles Heel, though, is that so much of the puzzle gameplay feels like going through the motions instead of clever challenges. In the end, I wish Immortals Fenyx Rising had tried to soar just a little higher on the wings of ambition. "
289,Dirt 5 ,8.0,"With hardboiled rally enthusiasts and sim junkies currently well-served by the stern and serious spin-off Dirt Rally 2.0, Codemasters has swerved to reshape its main off-road series into a sort of Driveclub on dirt; Dirt 5 is an accessible and rowdy racer that’s easy on the eye and fun to pick up and play, even if it’s ultimately a shade on the shallow side relative to what I’ve come to expect from these games.  Score: 9.2
My key criticism of the career mode is that the variety it appears to offer doesn’t really stand up to scrutiny. I’ve been playing Dirt 5 for a week and there are still event types I can’t really tell the difference between. Land Rush and Stampede in particular both blur into one for me, and Rally Raid doesn’t feel much different to those either. Path Finder events are a handful of hill climb time-attacks in a specialty rock bouncer but, while these courses are the steepest and narrowest, they don’t really require a particularly finessed approach so I didn’t find them as interesting to tackle as I thought I would. Sprint racing? Well, it feels like it’s in the wrong game. The ice racing is probably my highlight – not only are they generally the best showcase for Dirt 5’s impressive lighting and weather effects, but ice is perhaps unsurprisingly the most satisfying drifting surface. These ice racing events require the most car control and, as such, I found them the most rewarding.   Whether you’re placing stacks of crushed cars or enormous corkscrews, Playgrounds’ editing tools are all quite straightforward – although I’m yet to build something I’m truly happy with. In the interim, I’m having plenty of fun attacking the user-created tracks already available. In some ways Playgrounds feels a bit like it comes from a completely different game, but it’s an excellent addition to the Dirt 5 package – especially in conjunction with four-player splitscreen multiplayer. Dirt 5 represents a complete about-face for the main Dirt series, shedding virtually all semblance of simulation in favour of an unabashed, arcade-inspired racing experience that draws from just about every influence you can name except its direct predecessor. It’s not especially deep, and there isn’t as much variety in the career mode as it claims, but it’s fast, frantic, and extremely handsome, and the wild and wacky stunt track editor truly has its hooks in me.

290,Fuser ,7.0, Harmonix made the late 2000s rock. You couldn’t go to a party or bar without seeing four plastic Rock Band instruments in a corner just begging for you and your friends to butcher a classic pop tune with. The music game fad tragically died out in the 2010s, but for a brief while Harmonix’s new DJ simulator, Fuser, rekindles some of its high points and inspires hope that the genre could make a comeback. Fuser does an admirable job of invoking the sensation of being an artist by helping you freely mix tracks like a pro, but score chasers may find that for them, the party is short-lived.   This works seamlessly more often than not, because there is a lot of behind-the-scenes heavy lifting being done by Fuser to make everything mesh and sound like disparate parts were supposed to be together all along. Inevitably, however, there’s a number of mixes where the magic trick feels far less enchanting, including some that just never feel like they would truly be considered as party starters in a scenario like this. Is there anything more cursed than dropping the vocals to “Killing in the Name Of” over any part of Smash Mouth’s “All Star?”  On that note, hopping into any mode before playing the eight to 10-hour campaign would be a mistake. The story of an up-and-coming DJ stumbling into opportunities to play on the stages of the world’s biggest acts is a boring and rote one, but it’s also Fuser’s effective tutorial, spreading handfuls of lessons and techniques over its 36 levels. In almost all of them, you’ll learn a new trick like adding distortion filters to tracks or how to synchronize drops of multiple instruments at the same time. There’s a smattering of objectives to complete during each performance, usually revolving around using the newly introduced skill or ability in your set. This is the most effective way to learn how to combine Fuser’s many components into a good show. That said, there are so many things to learn, involving so much menu surfing and management, that I rarely used any of these concepts outside of when I was specifically asked to.  When things clicked for me, Fuser felt as cool and challenging as my best times with Rock Band or Guitar Hero. Going back to old stages to try to beat my personal best, armed with new knowledge and songs, was fun and fulfilling. The campaign is also the only mode with nearly this much to do. Frankly, the absence of a dedicated mode that takes the objective-based play of the campaign into a more arcadey setting is a big disappointment. The campaign stages are fun but fixed rather than dynamic, and don't allow you to feel like you’re being fully trusted to keep up with the level’s demands without the tutorial-like guardrails.    iframe allowautoplay="""" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/gallery/41631/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery41631"" scrolling=""no""> In Freestyle mode, you are let loose to do whatever you want with the tools you have available. This is the mode Fuser bridges the gap between rhythm game and actual digital instrument in a way that most in the genre can only hope to. With a little practice, you can create whole performances that feel like real artistic expression as opposed to dressed up karaoke. You can even share them for others to experience. This fits right into the rising demand for musical performances on streaming sites like Twitch (though maybe not into its relationship with playing licensed music on its platform). There’s a co-op mode as well, and here a pair of people can pass the mix back and forth to one another in collaborative set-slamming. The mileage you'll get from Freestyle is user specific, of course; I got my feet wet with it a few times but didn’t find much there for me without a score to chase but a real musical creative type could spend ages with it.   At its best, Fuser feels like the most promising attempt yet to bring back the glory days of social music gaming. The tutorial-like campaign scratches the itch for fast-paced rhythm-based score chasing, while the Freestyle mode could be turned into a true platform for content creation in the right hands. But a dearth of replayable game modes, lack of local multiplayer, and an exhausting grind to unlock more tracks can really kill the vibe. "
291,Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity ,9.0, If there’s one thing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild fans want, it’s more Breath of the Wild, and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity is here to give us… something kinda like that. Like the previous Hyrule Warriors games, this is Zelda as seen through a Dynasty Warriors lens, but the key difference here is that Age of Calamity’s premise takes us back to the events of The Great Calamity referenced throughout Breath of the Wild. This is the story of the Champions, of Zelda’s struggle to awaken her power, and of the resurrection of Ganon. The resulting game is a great fit for Koei Tecmo’s famous 1 vs 1000 gameplay, and also a fun new spin on a much-loved world. Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity really does feel like a love letter to Breath of the Wild. It goes out of its way to include as many of the signature elements of that game as it can, from the bestiary and Sheikah powers, through to cooking, Koroks, clothing options and paragliding, and they really set the tone – but it doesn’t stop there.  Age of Calamity is packed with systems, mechanics, locations, and Easter eggs pulled from its predecessor, and coming across these is a joy. Of course Link can shield surf! Or parry Guardian lasers. And why shouldn’t he wield tree branches, soup ladles, and mops as weapons? And why not cast Magnesis to yank treasure chests out of the ground or use an Octorok to polish up rusty weapons? And what could be more normal than tuning the Sheikah Sensor to find ingredients across the map? My more than 40 hours with Age of Calamity were filled with moments in which Koei Tecmo’s reverence for the source material was abundantly clear. Age of Calamity is able to expand upon this world in a number of areas too. There’s a large cast of playable characters for one, letting you get a sense for how deadly Impa was as a young woman, or how skilled the Champions were in battle during their prime. We even get to pilot the Divine Beasts, and while these missions aren’t actually all that exciting, they’re still a good palate cleanser, as well as an effective way to bring Breath of the Wild’s backstory to life, and to make these lumbering titans feel more real than they ever did before.  Perhaps the most significant new twist, however, is also likely to be the most divisive. The opening cutscene introduces us to a miniature Guardian who comes alive at the moment Zelda’s powers awaken – when all hope is lost – and then travels back in time to warn the heroes about what is to come. Now, the Guardian itself is adorable, sure, but the time-traveling motif naturally raises the question of whether this prequel will follow the events as described in Breath of the Wild, or whether it will create its own timeline by altering the past. I’m not going to directly answer that question here, as the story should be yours to discover, but what I will say is that while many events transpire, and there’s plenty of high-stakes drama, the actual characterisation along the way is pretty lacking. Zelda, for instance, spends a big chunk of the time playing the one note she played in most of the memories in Breath of the Wild – namely, self-doubt that she’ll ever unlock her power and be useful. It’s disappointing that she’s played so straight when this was an opportunity to do more with, well, all of the main characters, actually. This is especially awkward because in battle, Zelda is a straight-up brawler – she wields the Sheikah Slate as her primary weapon, and yet, this badass killing machine is still meek, bookish, and lacking confidence as far as the story is concerned. There’s even an escort mission in which she can’t fight, despite the fact that – mere moments earlier – she was slaughtering hundreds if not thousands of Bokoblins, Moblins, Lizalfos, and everything else Hyrule’s got. If Age of Calamity can toss a time-travelling Guardian into the mix, surely it could’ve done a little more with Zelda, too? Another way to look at it is that Breath of the Wild’s story was disjointed by design – you pieced it together as you came across memories and other flashbacks, whereas here we have a storyline that runs from start to finish, yet still doesn’t really tell us anything meaningful about its characters. None of this should really be a surprise, though, because Age of Calamity is not trying to be a Final Fantasy game. Big events are often delivered through narrated text on-screen (with some pretty questionable voice acting), while the cutscenes are largely just brief interludes that help keep the story going, or show off something cool. The primary purpose of the overarching story really is to provide a backbone for ever-evolving gameplay across the dozens of hours of Age of Calamity. And in this capacity it serves its purpose admirably.  While I’d have liked a little more insight into the characters, the Rock Roast of this game really is its combat. The foundation is deliberately simple, with every character having an array of different combos based around regular attacks transitioning into strong attacks, as well as a unique central mechanic. Impa, for instance, uses ZR to place symbols on enemies which she can then absorb with strong attacks to create mirror images of herself. Absorb three symbols and she’s at full power, with a line of clones fighting to either side of her. Impa can feel absurdly powerful in this state, spraying a barrage of blades at anyone in even the vaguest of vicinities. This feeling of power only grows as you upgrade her weapons and start to take advantage of seals – weapon augmentations – that suit her play style.  What’s impressive is that every character in the roster is this distinct. Urbosa, for instance, has a lightning gauge which can be channeled – one segment at a time – into extra-powerful strong attacks in her combos. Her fighting style is very much like a dance, and I love how she balances elegant, contained moves with outright devastation. Her lightning gauge is instantly refilled after using a weak-point smash too, allowing you to chain together shockingly effective sequences of moves. Mipha, meanwhile, literally swims around the battlefield, and her key mechanic lets her close the distance to enemies by bursting from fountains, then juggle them in the air before launching them again with another fountain, and so on. Seals that do extra damage to airborne enemies work well for Mipha's tridents. I’d love to also tell you about some of the insane characters you’ll unlock later on, but that would be spoiler territory, so instead I’ll just say: woah. Age of Calamity has some awesome surprises and some truly deep cuts that fans are really going to love. They don’t all land – some characters are more intuitive to use and more robust in design than others – but still, the overall roster is a lot of fun. Coming back to what we can discuss, Link is perhaps the most traditional character, but he also offers up the most variety: he boasts different combos, special attacks, and ZR mechanics based on the weapon type he’s using – sword and shield, spear, or the two-handed weapon category. Sword and shield, for instance, opens up parrying, shield surfing, and a rapid-fire bow, whereas two-handed weapons let him sacrifice some of his own health to juice up attacks. He’s a powerhouse. Of course, these are just a few of the ingredients going into this mighty combat stew. Every playable character can also use four Sheikah runes – Stasis, Cryonis, Magnesis and Remote Bombs – with a unique implementation for each character. Link uses his Cryonis block as a launcher, for instance, while Impa rides hers around like some kind of ultra-compact ice car. It’s fun seeing how each has been realised in-game. The runes’ role in combat is less freewheeling than you might expect them to be, however, as each boss – including area bosses – clearly signposts when to use a particular rune against them. It’s not enough for a big Bokoblin to be holding a shield in front of its body – you’ll also get an unmissable bomb icon telling you explosives are the way to break its guard. This happens in basically every combat encounter and, to be fair, is a wise move for a game that’s aiming to be broadly accessible. Age of Calamity’s combat isn’t meant to be punishing, after all, it’s meant to be empowering fun. The main issue for me is that all of this hand-holding discouraged me from experimenting and using my runes at other times, as I didn’t want to get caught out needing to counter an attack while the ability recharged. That said, there are some instances in which it makes sense to proactively use rune powers. Any time you’re able to open an enemy up to chip away at its weak-point gauge, for instance, you can use Stasis to give yourself the opportunity to whittle it down further. And against any enemy with a weak-point gauge that’s very much your priority, as eliminating the gauge lets you execute a weak-point smash attack which will one-shot most area bosses and do a major chunk of damage to anything tougher. It would have been nice if all the rune powers had a similarly strategic impact, but generally speaking they’re used reactively. Elemental powers, on the other hand, work in much the same way as they did in Breath of the Wild. If you’re facing a Fire Moblin (yes, there are more enemy variants now), using an Ice Rod is going to be super effective, whereas waggling a Fire Rod in its direction will tickle it at best. And of course you can do things like target a metal crate with a Lightning Rod to amplify the area of effect. It’s good to see these kinds of interactions return. Perhaps the most critical part of why the combat feels good, however, is Age of Calamity’s implementation of dodging. Being able to lock on to larger enemies then dodge away from their attacks is a big part of what gives the action its sense of speed, letting you dance around the outside of a massive enemy or go straight at Lynels, confident you can evade their Savage Lynel Swords. And best of all, if you dodge at the right time you’ll trigger a Flurry Rush that gives you an opening to take a big chunk off the opponent’s weak-point gauge. In Age of Calamity, dodging – and by extension the Flurry Rush – is king.  Many of the most thrilling missions double down on the fast-paced combat by putting you on the clock. There’s a real sense of urgency when you know you need to capture a certain number of outposts or take down a certain set of powerful enemies within a limited time. In these missions you’re not bothering with the cannon fodder or scouring the corners of the map for Koroks or treasure chests. Instead, you’re bee-lining for your objective, entirely focused on dodging attacks and finding ways to whittle down those crucial weak-point gauges. Often you’re also dispatching allies to the other key points on the map so that you can switch directly from one objective to another. Combat can be a little rough around the edges, however. The camera isn’t always helpful and sometimes loses the action completely. And while Age of Calamity generally feels fast and responsive, the frame rate can vary a bit, and this is even more noticeable in splitscreen co-op, where the game’s gorgeous visual style also takes a significant hit. It’s a real shame Koei Tecmo didn’t allow for online co-op. dir=""ltr""  Age of Calamity can be as easy or as hard as you want it to be. Aside from the broad difficulty settings, you have the freedom to attempt missions while you’re under the recommended level, or conversely, only ever attempt missions once you’re well above. There are so many missions that unlock over the course of the campaign that I almost never found myself having to grind to hit a certain level. In fact, the times I repeated missions were for specific drops or enemy trophies to help me complete subquests across the map. The vast majority of the time I was doing new missions. I really like the way the progression system is structured, too. You can pay to level up allies if need be, but a character’s level is obviously only part of the picture. Completing more missions with a character means you’ll get more weapon drops for them, and spare weapons can be fused onto your existing weapon to make it more powerful and add additional perks via the seal system. And no, your weapons will never break – not even if it’s a tree branch.  I’m also a fan of how cooking has been implemented in Age of Calamity. Recipes are unlocked, as opposed to discovered through experimentation, but if you have all the ingredients you’re able to cook one or more meals before every mission, and this opens up a whole host of possibilities. If you’re slightly under-leveled you might want to stack on attack power or reduce damage taken. If you know you’ll be facing a series of bosses you may want to widen the timing window for triggering Flurry Rushes. Perhaps you just want as much XP as you can get. Or bonus rupees. There are so many options, and sometimes making Dubious Food  is absolutely the right choice. Age of Calamity really does offer a wealth of content. All the way through the main story I was steadily unlocking new characters, revealing more missions, gaining access to more services and perks, seeing new weapon seals pop up, and upgrading my roster with more combos, more hearts, stronger powers, and so on. At no point did I hit a wall; instead I was always making progress, and always having fun. And even now, with the main story complete, my journey still isn’t over because there’s so much left to do. Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity offers a welcome trip back to a world I’ve clocked hundreds of hours in. Its hugely varied roster of characters, solid combat mechanics, fun progression and clever adaptation of Breath of the Wild’s vision of Hyrule is a joy to play and discover. While there are some missed characterisation opportunities, Age of Calamity is still a blast from start to finish. "
292,Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory ,7.0,"At long last, diehard Kingdom Hearts fans have received the musical love letter to their beloved series that they’ve long awaited. Taking influences from musical spinoff Theatrhythm, Melody of Memory grabs your hand and gleefully parades you through some of the most heartfelt moments in the long-running Kingdom Hearts series, which is now spread across over 14 games (if you also include minor entries like Re:Coded and Kingdom Hearts 0.2). One of the best parts about this rhythm-based game is you don’t have to be a huge Kingdom Hearts fan to drop in and enjoy bite-sized chunks thanks to the plethora of iconic Disney music and easy-to-learn gameplay. It does, however, end up feeling shallow after several solid hours of play. Given its simple controls and on-rails levels, very little of it feels remarkable or unique in practice compared to other rhythm games, and you may find yourself mindlessly breezing through it.   It doesn’t do much to bring new people into the series’ elaborate story, but longtime Kingdom Hearts fans looking for a nostalgia fix will be pleased to discover that Melody of Memory channels the series’ roots better than even Kingdom Hearts 3, warts (and Keyblades) aside. It brings back characters and levels from movies like Aladdin, Tangled, Peter Pan, and much more from across the series, while generously doling out collectibles and art pieces that pay delicate homage to the respective games that inspired them.  The main attraction here is the World Tour campaign, which has you collecting stars and progressing through a world map that represents almost every soundtrack across the entire series. There were a few that I skipped, but in all, the compilation seemed robust. Regardless it’s a wonderful trip down memory lane, set to the beat of music from Kingdom Hearts 1 all the way to last year’s Kingdom Hearts 3. A single playthrough will eat up no more than five to 10 hours, depending on how much of it you choose to explore. iframe allowautoplay="""" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/action-ironside/19497/gallery/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery19497"" scrolling=""no""> If you do, you’ll find some substance here: you can earn and craft items like healing potions that can save you from failing a level if you miss too many notes, and you do still earn experience points and level up a team. In fact there’s even a synthesis system that stylishly hearkens right back to the one that fans will recall from Kingdom Hearts 2. It’s unfortunate that items often feel useless and unnecessary then, and as such, the crafting system can be totally ignored or end up as little more than window dressing. Unless you’re really struggling with the basic rhythm gameplay, nothing you do or prepare here ever really matters, even during the harder boss battles. That isn’t to say synthesis is totally pointless. The best section of the synthesis menu is where you can earn access to special levels and collectibles, which are certainly worth it if you want to see everything.   Everybody’s here for the ride. You get to play with Sora, Riku, Roxas, and even Kairi. And you can also bring iconic Disney characters like Mickey Mouse or other supporting characters to join you along the way, though it’s disappointing that there isn’t much of a gameplay impact based on which characters are in your team. Speaking of, you do progressively level your teams up and there are stats like Strength and Defense in play. However, I didn’t notice any impact from those either.   The good news is that there are a ton of ways to enjoy the wealth of Kingdom Hearts memorabilia included in Melody of Memory, including a Track Selection mode and a Museum mode that lets you go back to those special scenes and experience them however you want. The Story Theatre is the best part of this, because it lets you go back and catch up on the most important parts of the story without getting inundated by gameplay. iframe allowautoplay="""" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/gallery/37296/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery37296"" scrolling=""no"">Guitar Hero. For the first time in a console-bound Kingdom Hearts game, there’s a multiplayer element to share with your friends. You can jump into split screen co-op multiplayer and experience everything with a friend on the same couch, or you can go online and compete in the VS Battles mode. Battles are fun but gimmicky; two people go head-to-head and use tricks, like blurring the other player’s vision to trip them up while you ensure your own victory by outscoring them. It’s great that they included it here, especially because we haven’t really seen much Kingdom Hearts multiplayer before.  Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory is a nostalgia-heavy reflection of a triumphant but persistently jumbled-up franchise about spell-slinging ducks and Final Fantasy characters living in Disney castles, but it lovingly memorializes its legacy and honors the fans who have grown to love it. While it doesn’t do anything remarkable or exciting with its rhythm gameplay, and it may not be the most alluring for those who don’t have the same understanding and love of Kingdom Hearts, it’s certainly a delightful experience that’s well worth the time spent.

293,NBA 2K21 for Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 ,7.0,"Usually with cross-generation games like this, when we play on the shiny new boxes we expect to see the exact same game but prettier. However, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X version of NBA 2K21 uses the opportunity to take the ambitious leap forward that the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 version didn’t. Everything feels newer and bigger, from the jaw-dropping variety in presentation to the giant City that can be explored in MyPlayer. It doesn’t shake the bad habits that rob the existing version of greatness, though: we’re still stuck with unnecessary grinding, putrid pay-to-win microtransactions, and a host of problems that seem like a direct result of NBA 2K21’s ambition. There’s a lot to be excited about, but much like a fast-break dunk gone awry, sometimes flash is less important than substance.   iframe allowautoplay="""" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/xbox-one-gaming-hardware/5010/gallery/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery5010"" scrolling=""no"">Verdict: When it’s clicking, NBA 2K21 has some of the best gameplay in sports video game history. But that’s been true for several years now, and though this year’s iteration improves on a handful of things, most notably the aimed shooting mechanic, there hasn’t been much movement. At the same time, it’s a shame that 2K’s focus isn’t on the fun you can have on the court, but instead the money that can be extracted from your wallet off of the court in the MyCareer and MyTeam modes, which just aren’t fun to grind through without paying. Maybe the new set of consoles on the horizon will bring a fresh start for the NBA 2K franchise, but right now I feel more pessimistic about the series’ future than ever. – Ben Vollmer, September 10, 2020. strong>Score: 6NBA 2K21 for Xbox One and PS4 reviewNBA 2K21 makes quite a few changes outside of the arena, too. MyCareer features the same disappointing story from the previous-generation versions, The Long Shadow, but it now includes a branching storyline that involves going to the G League out of highschool instead of playing for one of the 10 available universities. The story follows mostly the same path as it did on the PS4 and Xbox One, though I did enjoy additions like the return of some characters that had made appearances in previous 2K stories, such as the over-the-top Jackson Ellis. That said, there’s an option to skip The Long Shadow and head straight to the NBA, and I’d still advise taking it. The writing is rarely any good, and the G League games are a slog to get through. dir=""ltr""    Another issue with MyPlayer is that it takes an exceedingly long time just to get to The City. Before you can, you have to graduate from Rookieville, a slot of courts available only to players new to the online MyPlayer experience. It’s not a horrible idea in theory, especially because the more limited server population makes for smoother matches, but you can’t squad up with friends here and the lack of apparel options leaves most players looking exactly the same. It took at least 10n matches for me to progress past Rookieville, and once my reputation was at Pro level I was never able to go back. It just felt like an unnecessary buffer for veterans of the series, especially when there are options to skip over other parts of the mode.       The rest of the revised modes are hit and miss. MyLeague and MyGM have been fused into the new MyNBA, which proves to be a nice change. It’s nice to get the best of both worlds, which includes the in-depth customization of MyLeague and the role-playing elements of MyGM. The new menu navigation is similarly convenient, as it gave me the ability to jump around from trade prospects to coaching decisions in the matter of a second or two. NBA 2K21 really takes advantage of the quick loading times and it’s never more evident than in MyNBA. Another nice addition is being able to control a WNBA league, which serves as a nice change of pace given the smaller player pool and difference in gameplay styles.    NBA 2K21 jumps into the new generation of consoles with a heaping pile of ambitious upgrades. On and around the court, it’s one of the best sports game experiences I’ve ever had. The movement is fluid, the presentation is startlingly good, and NBA 2K21 leaves a lot of the franchise’s legacy issues in the dust. The rest of NBA 2K21, namely everything it does off the court, feels like the first half of an alley-oop. There’s so much potential in the MyPlayer experience that it’s maddening that things feel so empty and heavily dependent on pay-to-win progression mechanics. Still, the new MyNBA mode has plenty of depth and streamlines things in a refreshingly simple way, and the ability to take on most of what NBA 2K21 has to offer through the WNBA is a really important addition. Ultimately, it’s just frustrating to see NBA 2K21 pass up what seems like it should be an easy slam dunk. "
294,Demon's Souls ,9.0,"In prep for this review I dusted off my PlayStation 3 and spent about a week replaying through the original 2009 Demon’s Souls. My main takeaway from that experience was, “Man, as fantastic as this game is, it feels old.” And I don’t just mean graphically: you can only roll in four directions, character controls feel loose, and just overall, there’s a lot of jank. But Bluepoint – the team that so expertly remade Shadow of the Colossus in 2018 – has addressed just about all of those major issues and more in the absolutely gorgeous PlayStation 5 remake, resulting in a game that feels much tighter to control and one that brings FromSoftware’s neglected original Souls game back to the forefront, reminding us what a strong foundation the Dark Souls series was built upon. Like the rest of the Souls series, the appeal of Demon’s Souls is that it’s an action-RPG that prides itself on difficult, cerebral, and methodical combat, as well as extraordinarily deep character build customization. In combat, every action poses a risk, whether it’s committing to an attack and leaving yourself vulnerable in the start-up and recovery of it, or committing to defense and sacrificing a portion of your stamina to avoid taking damage. Rather than relying mostly on reflexes, Demon’s Souls relies more on making smart decisions both in and out of combat, and making the right decisions in order to overcome its many tough challenges feels incredibly rewarding in ways few other games can match.  Demon’s Souls may be the game that kicked off the Souls subgenre of action-RPGs, but it is the ways in which it’s different from the Dark Souls games that really make it stand out. The biggest is that rather than being one contiguous open world, Demon’s Souls is split into five isolated worlds, each made up of three to four sublevels, each offering their own unique rewards and challenges. The thing I love so much about this structure is how easy it becomes to just pack up, leave, and try out a new area if you find yourself struggling in the one you’re currently in. Each level is difficult, but in very different ways, and never for reasons as simple or as boring as the enemies simply just being stronger. World 1 is tough because you frequently have to contend with an obnoxious dragon that spends its whole day roasting each of the bridges you need to cross in order to proceed; World 2’s enemies are resistant to most damage types outside of piercing; World 3 is a labyrinth that’s easy to get lost in and is guarded by tough mind flayers that can kill you in just one or two hits; World 4 has highly aggressive skeletons that are also resistant to most weapons outside of maces and hammers; and World 5 has a ton of enemies that are easy to kill, but have a nasty habit of swarming you with rapid hits and wild attack patterns. Not to mention the whole “lake of poison” thing. What’s clever about this is that Demon’s Souls’ structure makes every playthrough feel different because you’re able to approach each world in new ways. For my first playthrough, I went with a magic-focused build and went to world 3 first so I could stock up on magic-replenishing consumables and unlock the NPC that grants access to the most powerful spells. But in my second playthrough with a more dexterity-driven character I bounced from world to world, picking up useful items and gear from each one before committing to beating any of them. It’s this flexibility that makes Demon’s Souls so distinctive among the Souls games. dir=""ltr""    strong>Verdict: Demon's Souls is not a game for everyone. Actually, I take that back; it's most definitely something everyone should try, but the look, seemingly unforgiving nature and themes might be a bit off-putting. Don't let them be. Every single person that owns a PS3 should at the very least rent this game to see what all the fuss is about, and those that can remember the good ol' days when games taught through the highly effective use of intense punishment and a heavy price for not playing it carefully should scoop this up instantly. It's utterly unique among the offerings on any console right now, and absolutely, positively should not be missed. - Sam Bishop, October 8, 2009Score: 9.4full original Demon's Souls reviewAll of this is true for Bluepoint’s remake, which largely stays true to the spirit of the original Demon’s Souls, both for better and for worse. Not all of the ways Demon’s Souls differentiates itself from the rest of the Souls series are positive ones. Demon’s Souls is exceptionally grindy in often frustrating, time-wasting ways. If you run out of health-restoring grass, you’ll need to either farm it by repeatedly killing specific enemies in specific worlds that drop it, or you’ll need to farm souls (that you could have used to improve your character) and purchase it from a merchant. Weapon upgrading is also needlessly convoluted, with 16 different types of upgrade materials to find and make sense of, and almost every weapon type requiring different materials in order to upgrade them. Dark Souls addressed both these issues with the introduction of Estus Flasks and a simplification of the weapon upgrade system, and going back to how it used to be made me remember how much of an improvement Dark Souls was in those regards.  The real stars of the show here, though, are the litany of smaller quality-of-life upgrades that make me never want to even think of going back to Demon’s Souls on the PS3. There’s so many to touch upon, but the long list includes: The addition of a tool belt that lets you equip up to four situationally useful items in a submenu that’s accessible with the touchpad; the ability to use archstones like a bonfire and reset the enemies without having to go back to the Nexus; being able to see the durability of your weapon in the HUD; being able to see what the next item you have equipped is; and all of this is on top of a much cleaner and more intuitive menu UI that sacrifices some of the original’s unique visual style in favor of simplicity and readability. I need to give a special mention as well to the new ability to send items to your storage box without having to return to the Nexus. Item burden is a huge factor in Demon’s Souls, and in the original, when you picked up something that you had no space for you’d have to either make room for it by permanently destroying something in your inventory or you’d have to just leave it and convince yourself that you didn’t really need whatever it was anyway. And then you’d also have to trek back to the archstone just so you could offload any unnecessary items. This is an elegant fix that still keeps the inventory management without any of the frustration. There’s still an annoyingly common tendency to use a shove attack when I don’t mean to, and I wish the developers had done something to better explain World Tendency to newcomers. But those nitpicks notwithstanding, Bluepoint did an excellent job of updating Demon’s Souls to modern standards without changing the core of its gameplay. One other area that Demon’s Souls obviously benefits by virtue of being on a console with an SSD is a substantial reduction in load times. Rarely will you ever wait more than five seconds in between deaths or while teleporting to a new location before you’re back in the action. I can’t overstate how huge this is for a game like Demon’s Souls, in which you’re expected to die over and over again and also to repeatedly reset a level for the purpose of farming. dir=""ltr""  The DualSense controller is much bigger than a DualShock 3, which makes it a tiny bit less comfortable to use the infamous “claw grip” that is almost required in a game like Demon’s Souls, but my hands adjusted over the course of X hours it took me to beat it. Most notable, though, is the way the haptics react to you being hit. When you block a big shot with your shield, you feel that strong jolt localized entirely on the left side of the controller; when you run over a fallen vase and it shatters you hear and feel that distinct impact; and when you ride an elevator, there’s an almost roller coaster-esque rumble that accurately imitates the churning of gears. It’s incredibly cool. Also, the provided in-game tip videos are fantastic tools that give progressively more specific hints. Those can either point you in the right direction if you’re lost in a stage or give you crucial tips against tough bosses to help you figure out a proper strategy to deal with them.  As one of the first games available exclusively on the PlayStation 5, it’s no surprise that Demon’s Souls is breathtaking to look at. There is a staggering level of attention to detail here. Enemies display looks of fear, anger, and desperation, and react realistically to every hit; Blood spatter sticks to your armor, weapons, and body; just about everything you walk through or on reacts naturally to your physical presence, whether its a puddle, box, vase, or a fallen enemy’s armor; fat jiggles on the grotesque Vanguard Demon when you make impact with a weapon. The list goes on and on. It is all around just a magnificent showcase of the power of the PlayStation 5 and an enticing taste and what’s to come if things can look this good on a launch game. Bluepoint definitely took more liberties with the art style and soundtrack than it did with the gameplay, and personally I love the art direction, even though I will say that I miss the jovial mystique of the PS3’s Fat Official compared to the remake’s, which looks like a radiation experiment gone horribly wrong. The soundtrack, in comparison to the mostly somber and lo-key music of the original, feels much louder and more bombastic during boss fights, which I dug – but it is so different that I can definitely understand people preferring the original. Demon’s Souls offers two visual modes labelled “Cinematic” and “Performance.” It’s the usual split that we’ve come to expect at this point, with the cinematic mode targeting 30fps with a true 4K resolution, and the performance mode keeping a consistent 60fps at 1440p, which is then upscaled to 4K. Personally, I’ve always been a framerate over fidelity guy, so I played the whole thing in performance mode and never looked back. That said, cinematic mode is definitely a stunner if you don’t mind sacrificing half the frames.  Of course, it wouldn’t be a Souls game without asynchronous multiplayer. If you’re familiar with how multiplayer has worked in other Souls games, Demon’s Souls should come as no surprise: Players can leave messages to give hints, point out secrets, or absolutely troll the heck out of you; you can play cooperatively with the tried-and-true method of leaving and activating summon signs; you can invade other players who are running the risk of going through a level while in human form; and you can lay down a red summon sign for some good ol’ fashioned consensual PVP. I’ve always kind of been lukewarm on Souls multiplayer, and Demon’s Souls is no exception. My attempts in trying to get summoned in co-op were met with a ton of waiting and very little payoff – especially since without the covenant system added in Dark Souls, there’s little incentive to offer your help outside of the fuzzy feeling in your belly that you get for doing a good deed. My one success in getting summoned for PVP didn’t fare much better as I got summoned for the Old Monk boss battle, only to have it end abruptly when the player I invaded never even made it to the door. After that, I simply lost the will to sit and wait for multiplayer in general unless I was coordinating with a friend. dir=""ltr"" Bluepoint’s team had the unenviable task of remaking an 11-year-old game with a cult following and making it look – and play – the part of being the very first game developed from the ground up for this current generation of consoles. And that’s exactly what they did. Demon’s Souls is breathtakingly gorgeous and plays significantly better than it did on the PS3, not only thanks to the graphical power of the PlayStation 5, but because of smart quality-of-life changes and light touches that modernize some frustrating aspects of the original, without ever sacrificing the relentless challenge, puzzle-infused boss battles, and style that made it such a landmark game in the first place. "
295,Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered ,9.0,"After playing Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales on PlayStation 5, it would’ve been really tough to go back to the PS4 version of 2018’s best superhero game. Fortunately, Insomniac has retrofitted Peter Parker’s adventure with all the outstanding tech it developed for Miles, including improved lighting and frame rates, ray-traced reflections, lightning-fast load times, and DualSense haptic feedback. And they replaced Peter’s face… which is weird, but at least it showcases the major improvements to facial animations. This is a game that was already worth replaying on PS4, but now that it’s on PS5 it’s a great time to revisit New York and see it at its best. Back in my original Marvel’s Spider-Man review, I called it Great, highlighting its awesome swinging through of New York City, its excellent Peter Parker story, and battles with familiar villains. I griped a bit about some suit powers being way better than others and the repetitive optional missions being a drag but it’s overall one of the best superhero games ever made. Two years later, all of that remains true, even next to the open-world side mission improvements I just played in the amazing Miles Morales adventure. Insomniac’s original Spidey tale is still a great Peter Parker adventure, even with a new face, featuring a great clash between the lives Peter leads both behind and out of his mask. And yes, it’s certainly jarring at first to see that face appear instead of the PS4 version, but I pretty quickly grew accustomed to this new look. Now I’ve come to like it more than the original. It looks more age-appropriate and more in line with the boyish but confident charm of Yuri Lowenthal’s memorable performance. His take on Peter still stands tall as one of my favorites, buoyed by Laura Bailey’s still-wonderful Mary-Jane, William Salyers’ broken Otto Octavius, and more. Re-experiencing Insomniac’s story has delighted me as much as it did the first time around, particularly in the wonderful first moments of Peter and Mary-Jane on screen together, Spider-Man’s friendship with Yuri Watanabe, and some of the bigger personalities of Peter’s foes. Improved facial animations, less plastic-y skin, and realistic hair tech add more realism to the chemistry between Peter and MJ, with a satisfied smirk betraying Peter’s hope that they’ll get back together, as well as the despair Otto experiences when his lab is shut down. It’s a big step up.  ""I was left delighted at nearly every step of its 15-hour adventure thanks to a surprisingly deep tale that mines the plights of both Spider-Man and Peter Parker to great emotional success. Underpinning that engrossing narrative is an excellent set of webswinging mechanics, which -- combined with fun gadgets and plenty of puns -- makes for thrilling action in both the massive setpieces and in the quiet, confined corridors of tense sequences. Insomniac’s first foray into the realm of Marvel superheroes is a continually exciting adventure whose open world and combat are only occasionally caught up in a web of overly familiar trappings.""   The DualSense is used pretty much exactly as it is in Miles Morales, which is excellent in helping to translate the sensation of playing as Spider-Man in more detail than ever before. I may never get the sensation of webslinging in real-life, but the DualSense’s haptic vibrations, trigger resistance, and a subtle “thwip” from the controller’s speaker do an admirable job of recreating what I imagine it’d be like. Likewise, if you have a 3D audio headset like the Pulse 3D, you get a nice extra level of immersion as the sounds of sirens go by in the distance and angry New Yorkers tell you to watch where you’re going as you run by on street level. But of course, my soundbar still does a perfectly good job of capturing the layered sounds of Insomniac’s New York as I swing through the streets.  Even if you’ve already beaten or even platinumed it on PS4, I’d recommend checking out how much more vibrant Insomniac’s New York City is. It’s a different time of year than Miles Morales’ Christmas setting, so it offers a different enough visual palette even though I’d just played that game. And all the fun of the gameplay is still there: Peter’s swinging and acrobatic combat flows just as well as I remember, and even more smoothly now when you choose the new 60fps performance mode (which sacrifices some of the nicer lighting effects). I still find myself leaning heavily toward my few suit mod preferences and the side missions aren’t any more diverse – I’ve already run into what feels like a few dozen muggings – but that’s remasters for you. The remaster also has all the benefits of bundling all three DLC episodes of The City That Never Sleeps. That’s another 10 or so hours of play, and it adds a largely satisfying comic book mini-arc that includes fantastic character work with Black Cat and Silver Sable. You take the bad with the good in the form of the annoying Screwball missions and a less-than-stellar second chapter, but these episodes work much better together than they did as separate episodes released a month apart as they were originally.   On top of that and the free suits Insomniac put out, the remastered edition has been enhanced with quality-of-life improvements, like the near-instantaneous load times on PS5, and even additions to Photo Mode to mirror the handy new lighting features of Miles’ version. Plus, Miles Morales’ huge suite of accessibility features have been added (something I’m kicking myself for neglecting to mention in my Miles review). There are options to change the contrast of the environment, enemy readability, quick-time event requirements, and much more. It’s a nice step up from the original’s included options. And if recent Spider-verse stories have taught us anything, it’s that anyone can wear the mask, and it’s lovely and important that Insomniac has carried that philosophy into its games. If you’ve never played Marvel’s Spider-Man...what have you been doing the last two years!? But your procrastination has paid off, because the remaster is a much better way to play thanks to the PS5’s fantastic lighting effects and loading times. Even as someone who platinumed the original, it’s a treat to revisit this improved New York City. The gameplay itself feels largely unchanged, but that still leaves you with a spectacular Spider-Man adventure, with all its additional content, that’s also one of the best superhero games ever made, and a visual treat to kick off the PS5 era. "
296,Destiny 2: Beyond Light Review in Progress,7.0,"Were it not for Bungie’s split with Activision last year, it feels like Destiny 2’s latest expansion, Beyond Light, might have just been called Destiny 3 instead. As the first installment in a trio of announced expansions, Beyond Light takes some bold steps in a new direction for the series – whether it’s the story’s darker, morally grey tone, the removal of legacy content from Destiny 2’s sandbox, or our formerly-exemplar Guardians giving in and using the corrosive power of The Darkness. In many ways, this is not the same Destiny 2 we’ve been playing for the past three years. But where Beyond Light deviates from its legacy in some important ways, it also finds itself making some of the same mistakes all over again. With a campaign that’s too short, an endgame that has you grinding the same activities ad nauseum, and a sandbox that seems perpetually imbalanced, my Guardian’s adventures on the snow-covered moon of Europa sometimes had me feeling left out in the cold in a very familiar way.   Although Destiny 2 is now technically “free-to-play,” most of the new content is gated behind a paywall, including the bulk of the Beyond Light experience. Not included in this review is anything that a player can access for free, like the cosmodrome “New Light” mission geared toward new players, as well as the “Season of the Hunt” content that’s kept behind a separate Season Pass (most of which isn’t even available yet). Instead, this review will focus on the paid content available in the core Beyond Light expansion.  Beyond Light’s campaign begins with a bang, as several planets in our solar system are blinked out of existence by Destiny’s longtime evil: The Darkness. You’re deployed to Europa in search of answers but, strangely enough, the adventure that follows is largely unrelated and frankly you never really find the answers you’re looking for. Instead, you end up going toe-to-toe with a particularly nasty Eliksni named Eramis, who has discovered a way to wield the awesome power of The Darkness in the form of a cosmis ice called Stasis. This story is one of the strongest in the series, mainly because Eramis is the first Destiny villain I’ve ever empathized with (and even felt a little sorry for). Many of Destiny’s best characters also receive a ton of much-deserved screen time including The Drifter, Variks, Eris Morn, and The Exo Stranger, who we haven’t seen since 2014 and who now takes the spotlight in a major way – and this time she finally has time to explain. Like most Destiny expansions, though, the campaign ends too quickly at around 6 hours long, and it leaves you with plenty of loose threads that aren’t likely to be addressed anytime soon. As a result, the fight with Eramis and her Stasis-wielding army ultimately feels like a side quest in an epic odyssey that will take the next two expansions (and potentially beyond) to play out. dir=""ltr""  Europa itself is a well-crafted frosty wasteland filled with darkness-wielding Fallen and milk-filled Vex that gives you plenty to grind for, but it offers few surprises. The most unique thing about Europa are the weather effects, which will regularly whip up a snowstorm that whistles in your ears and obscures your vision. During the campaign these snowstorms are really cool, immersive events that make you feel like you’re fighting against the moon itself as much as you are Eramis’ armies. But once the campaign ends and you’re running around Jupiter’s moon doing public events and patrol missions that you’ve already done a thousand times, the frequent whiteouts can get old pretty fast – I’m just trying to collect flecks of dark, my dude. Aside from the weather, there isn’t a whole lot about Europa that we haven’t seen elsewhere. You’ll do some public events, including plenty you’ve already done on other planets, find a few lost sectors to loot (ones that are among my favorites yet, even if they’re largely brief distractions), and run around completing patrols and looting chests until your thumbs bleed. There’s also a neat new strike called “The Glassway,” which pits you against some more nasty robots and their inappropriate time travel shenanigans. All told, Europa is a nice addition to Destiny’s ecosystem of explorable locales, but very much par for the course with others we’ve seen. To rise to the challenge of the new threats (and grinds) that await on Europa, your guardian will need to embrace the corrupting force of The Darkness, which unlocks a whole host of powerful Stasis ice powers. With Stasis, you gain devastating abilities to slow and freeze enemies, then shatter them into pieces, which can create chain reactions that lay waste to even daunting adversaries in one of the most thoroughly satisfying experiences in Destiny to date. I really can’t stress enough how much joy it brings me to charge onto the battlefield with some icy space magic and turn an entire army into my personal crystalline statue exhibit, then blow it all up. As you progress through Beyond Lights’s endgame content, you’ll unlock new abilities, aspects, and fragments – all of which allow you to customize your Stasis abilities to fit your playstyle or tackle specific activities. For example, you can unlock grenades that seek out and freeze your enemies, or equip a mod that gives you super energy when you crack open a frozen baddie. Unlocking new Stasis modifiers is an incredibly attractive incentive to push through Beyond Light’s endgame grind, which, in typical Destiny fashion, has you running strikes, playing competitive multiplayer matches in the Crucible, and unfortunately, hanging out with the Drifter in Gambit. As someone who enjoys a fair amount of competitive PvP in Destiny, I’d be remiss not to mention that Crucible seems to have been given the (perhaps thematically fitting) coldest of shoulders in Beyond Light, to the point where I wonder if Bungie remembers it even still exists. No new Crucible maps or modes have been added, and the planned changes to the endgame PvP mode, Trials of Osiris, were recently delayed. What’s worse is Beyond Light's additions to Destiny 2’s sandbox have an entirely adverse effect on the Crucible. Being able to freeze enemies is awesome on Europa, but once an opposing player does it to you in PvP, locking you in place for long enough for them to kill you five times over, it’s far more frustrating than fun. Even more devastating is that Stasis completely shatters any semblance of balance in PvP, as ice abilities can freeze you even when you’re in the middle of your super, kill you through walls, and generally make the Crucible an unpleasant place to be. At the time of this publishing, I'm at 1221 Power, have completed just about every mission available in Beyond Light, and am a fair way through the mindless grind to become “raid ready” before the new raid is released on November 21st. Once I’ve gotten my frostbitten fingers onto the new raid, I’ll update my review here with a final score. For more on Destiny 2, consider tuning in to IGN’s weekly Destiny podcast: Fireteam Chat. New episodes are posted on IGN.com every Friday at 5 PM PST. Destiny 2: Beyond Light is another solid expansion to the ever-evolving shooter that you know and love, but falls prey to the same content scarcity and repetitious grind it’s always had. The campaign is short, but enjoyable, and the raid is awesome enough to make the less pleasant parts of the grind worth it in the end. "
297,Godfall Review in Progress,6.0,"New consoles have an illustrious history of launch-day games that are fairly entertaining and technically impressive, but in hindsight don’t make much of a lasting impact on the generation they help debut. Godfall feels like a game that will probably occupy that space for the PlayStation 5 (to which it is a timed console exclusive), putting it in the company of games like Ryse: Son of Rome on the Xbox One, Red Steel on the Wii, or even (dare I say) Knack on the PlayStation 4. So far it’s an amusing loot-based hack-and-slasher with a gorgeous look and loads of loadout choice, but a thin story and strategically similar missions have kept it from feeling like much more than skin-deep fun. Alongside its PS5 launch Godfall is also coming to PC, and that’s where I’ve spent around eight hours with it so far (while I await the delivery of my PS5). I have lots more to see and I’d estimate at least a few more hours until I beat its campaign, but I’ve still played more than enough to get a good understanding of its chunky combat, surprising structure, and concerning obsession with bloom lighting effects.  Despite having loot, three-player online co-op, repeatable missions that you can grind for gear, and the promise of endgame content, developer Counterplay Games says this is not a “game as a service” in the same vein as Destiny – and from what I’ve played so far, it doesn’t entirely feel like one either. Instead it plays like a linear campaign wearing the skin of a live service game, obviously designed for replayability but without the trappings of microtransactions and an endless update cycle. Part of that skin is a story that’s the very definition of passable. Godfall’s opening cinematic (which you can watch here) does the bare minimum to loosely establish its beautifully designed world and a warring feud between you – a fallen king named Orin – and the big bad Macros, your brother who is trying to become a god even if it means destroying the world as a result. Your quest to stop him is a threadbare setup to go fight some dudes that's mostly told through info dumps at your base, not doing much to pull me from one mission to the next but also not so bad as to stop me from wanting to do them altogether. Those missions take place on three open-world maps called realms, which are dotted with a decent variety of enemies to kill, chests to open, and resources to gather. A mission will generally give you a specific goal or target within a map, but you’re also free to wander around and find other stuff as you do it – or even stick around after the mission to complete extra encounters for even more loot. It’s a structure that surprised me, one that reminded me a lot of Warframe’s sprawling, reward-filled levels but with a set layout instead of a procedurally pieced together one. dir=""ltr""  All three of these realms – earth, water, and air – really are beautiful to look at, and their bespoke designs mean they can sometimes have a logic to them that I appreciated. On the earth map, for example, there’s a large fortress built into a mountain that is visually distinct from the flat battlefield strewn with destroyed siege weapons just outside its gates. These are cool areas to run through… the first few times, at least. The other side of this coin is that Godfall’s missions all have similar objectives that will send you running through the same areas of these maps over and over again – so while it’s fun to stumble upon secret resources and cool sights initially, they inevitably lose their luster upon repeat visits, especially when nearly every mission so far can be summed up as “follow this waypoint, then kill this thing.” Godfall really does look great though, with vibrant environments and incredible character, world, and equipment designs. That said, I think it needs a bit of bloom intervertention. Part of the “next-gen” feel it gives off is that everything in this world is shining like the dang sun. It’s not always an issue, but there are times where particularly strong lights make it hard to actually see the objects they are shining on, as well as corners where the opposite is true and a lack of light makes them far too dark. You can turn bloom down on PC at least, but it’s seemingly used to make Godfall look newer and shinier (literally) than it actually is. Thankfully, the combat itself has kept me amused so far. While it is certainly clunky at times – for example, there’s no way to quickly swap between locked-on targets, and why in the world is light attack on R1 and heavy attack on R2 with no way to rebind them? – the rhythm I eventually settled into was satisfying and impressively flexible. Godfall has loads of different combat mechanics to explore, all of which feel like powerful avenues no matter which of its distinct-feeling weapons you decide to use. Some of it is familiar, like using heavy attacks to build up an enemy’s “breach” gauge, exposing them to finishing moves and more damage when full. But while that emphasizes leading with heavies (especially against guarding enemies), the novel Soulshatter mechanic encourages the opposite: on top of their regular damage, light attacks will essentially bank part of an enemy’s health bar, and when you follow up with a heavy hit it triggers that effect to deal all of the damage you banked in a single burst. Use that to finish an enemy off and they’ll actually explode in a lovely puff of particles. Soulshatter adds an engaging and easy to understand combo mechanic to every fight, and I enjoyed trying to figure out just the right amount of light attacks to hit with before using a heavy to pop an enemy like a balloon. dir=""ltr""  On top of that, there’s also the polarity system, which is an interesting method of incentivizing you to both stick with and also swap between your two equippable weapon slots. Dealing damage with one weapon will charge the polarity of the other, and switching to a fully charged weapon will empower its attacks for a while – but if you switch too early, the charge starts over. Weapon effects can use this in interesting ways too: I spent some time with a longsword (which provides a good balance of speed and power) that charges polarity faster, while my secondary weapon was a set of dual blades (a much quicker alternative) that would cause a status ailment when it had its polarity buff active. It’s a neat mechanic that made my choice of secondary weapon feel just as important as my primary. Another place for you to flex your preference is in your choice of Valorplate, which are basically suits of armor that slightly alter your capabilities and all look incredibly cool. There are 12 total that are unlocked at a fairly fast pace just by playing, and each one shares your overall character level and equipment. Every Valorplate is designed to amplify one of Godfall’s other mechanics: one increases breach damage while another increases Soulshatter buildup, and there’s one for each status ailment, including Ignite, Chill, Shock, and Poison. One of my favorites so far has been Bulwark, a Valorplate that increases Bleed chance, since I’ve been able to pair it with weapons that also cause Bleed and deal extra damage to enemies affected by it. It’s very fun to find these combos with your equipment and build around those synergies – the only problem is that every Valorplate largely feels like a different flavor of the same puzzle. Whether you’re using Phoenix for fire or Typhon for water, it doesn’t functionally change much in the heat of combat (in fact, according to the load screen tooltips, effects like Ignite, Bleed, and Curse even share the same generic ""deals damage over time"" effect). That’s slightly less true for Valorplates built around other systems, like the Soulshatter-focused Greyhawk, which might have me leaning into that mechanic more, but even their unique Archon Fury ability is practically identical across the board, giving you a temporary boost to whatever mechanic or ailment they are centered around. As a result, how you play is influenced far more by the weapon types you choose than the fancy armor you put on. As you might expect, using a greatsword or a giant hammer is a very different experience from the dual blades or pike. And despite gravitating toward the faster options, so much loot is thrown at you that I’ve so far found myself swapping fairly frequently as stronger options are picked up. The different effects these can have are compellingly diverse, tweaking polarity charging, weapon abilities, ailment effects, and more, and really letting you decide what direction interests you most. And in case this trend wasn’t already clear, they are also extremely cool to look at, with a massive amount of visual diversity even within a single weapon type – blades can range from fantasy cleavers to ornate hybrids of ancient and futuristic design, and I'm still finding new options that continue to impress. dir=""ltr""  However, I do wish Godfall’s menus and upgrading systems were just a little less cumbersome to use. Inventory management and equipment upgrading is fairly simple, and I appreciate how much opportunity you have to keep your favorite pieces of gear relevant longer if you can spare the right resources, but there are a lot of rough edges when picking your loadout: The descriptions of items take a moment to slide onto their card when you hover over them, which slows down the process greatly when weighing your options or just looking for that one hammer you had with fire damage; you can’t salvage an item from the screen you equip on, and you can’t equip from the screen you salvage on; and perhaps most frustrating of all, you can’t salvage an item if it’s equipped on a different Valorplate, but there’s no indication for which of the dozen suits it’s equipped on and no easy way to find out apart from slowly checking every single one. These aren’t huge issues, but they add friction to the already laborious practice of inventory management. That all said, I still have a lot more to play. First up, I need to beat the main story, after which I can dive into its promised endgame content. I also still need to spend more time with Godfall in co-op – it’s been fine to play solo, but I’m curious to see how the online works and how missions and fights scale differently. Finally, as this is a PS5 launch game, I want to make sure I see how Godfall differs on that system once mine arrives (and if there’s some use of the DualSense that justifies the mandatory binding of your basic attacks to the shoulder and trigger). As of right now, however, I’m enjoying Godfall, even if it’s not doing much to wow me and the repetition of its missions is wearing a bit thin. It’s got some fun and satisfying combat, a few genuinely novel mechanics, and graphics that range from absolutely gorgeous to a little over the top – but unless its thin story morphs into more than an excuse to go stab stuff, the grindable action-looter structure doesn't seem like it has enough variety to sustain its otherwise expansive customization. Godfall can be an enjoyable and lovely gear-based action game while it lasts, but the repetition of its missions wears thin before the end of its campaign, and even thinner in the endgame afterward. Its combat is packed full of decisions to make and a healthy mix of familiar and genuinely novel mechanics, but its Valorplate suits aren’t as mechanically diverse as they initially seem on their gorgeous exteriors. With neither an interesting story nor a deep pool of varied content, all the choice Godfall offers doesn’t amount to much more than a bit of brief and shallow fun. "
298,The Pathless ,8.0,"The Pathless is at its best when it’s living up to its name — as the mysterious Hunter, I found myself most enraptured by this open world when I let my curiosity guide me. Built to satisfy that curiosity, the landscape is filled with engaging environmental puzzles, hidden bits of lore that deepen its main story, and gorgeous landscapes. Coupled with a simple but engrossing movement mechanic that makes exploration an absolute treat and an orchestral score that elevates the mythic quality of this new world, The Pathless is a journey absolutely worth taking. At the heart of The Pathless, and what makes the adventure work so well, is its movement mechanics, which are rather revelatory in their simplicity. This island is filled with floating gems, which you need to shoot with your only weapon, a bow, to gain speed and maintain your flow. Because of this, the sensation of running, of gaining and maintaining speed, is a sheer delight, and that turns the world into something of a playground for how you get around on foot and in the air. The Hunter is always accompanied by an eagle companion, who can not only carry you across distances by gliding, but also use a limited number of flaps to increase its flight height. It’s just as well that there’s no fast travel, because skipping the running and gliding would be missing the point. The shooting doesn’t require a lot of skill because developer Giant Squid has completely removed the worry of precision aiming. Instead, the forgiving third-person camera lets you swing it around to auto-target gems. You just need to hold the right trigger down to fill up a meter, or if your timing is good, let it fill up precisely halfway to get even more speed.  I never fully mastered the half-fill shot, even despite the PS5’s adaptive triggers offering some haptic indication to let me know when to release. But a missed shot here or there rarely tripped me up; as I said, The Pathless is all about blazing your own trail around its world, and each failed hit was an excuse to improv my way into a new direction. And while you can wander aimlessly, there’s plenty to guide your way and reward your curiosity. Two main collectibles in particular are plentifully hidden throughout the world: Crystals, which are needed to increase your eagle’s ability to reach new heights, and Lightstones, which are often collected after some intricate but satisfying puzzle and used to cleanse a cursed watchtower in each region. Cribbing an Assassin’s Creed Eagle Vision-like mode, you can hit a button to look into the spirit world, which highlights “corrupted” locations - aka collectible hubs - in red and completed areas in blue or with a hovering icon, giving you some idea of where to go. And that’s particularly helpful because, unlike its obvious inspirations like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Ubisoft open world games, The Pathless includes no in-game map. You can climb to high towers to then survey the land around you, but you can’t mark a cliffside or building for you to track later. It can be a bit disorienting at first in any new region, especially as I went from the easy-to-scour forests to more mountainous terrain with blizzard conditions making visibility more difficult, but over time I appreciated how it forced me to learn and remember the world around me.   The Pathless’ world is a very naturalistic one - lush forests lay near massive cliff faces and the winding paths up them, and as you reach new heights the weather turns the land into a frigid tundra. Its striking beauty becomes more apparent after you defeat each boss - freeing a region of a curse also lifts the overcast around it, letting the sun shine and brighten up the gorgeous greens of the land and deep blues of the sea surrounding the island. Showdowns with the corrupted gods are quite cool in execution. They’re part chase scene as you hunt your foe through the landscape and part Zelda-esque battle with several phases. While the first battle is relatively simple, Giant Squid finds some inventive twists on its formula, such as its Hydra-like boss and arenas that require a bit of mid-battle platforming to ensure survival. And each battle is backed by some of my favorite pieces of composer Austin Wintory’s overall fantastic orchestral score. The chase music in particular evokes epic movie scores like The Lord of the Rings and Pirates of the Caribbean, swelling to bombastic heights while deep-throated chanting can build to a few awe-inspiring moments as you first glimpse a new part of the island or prepare for an imminent fight.  The bosses provide another obstacle before you even fight them. As you explore each of The Pathless’ four main regions, a giant red orb of a storm shifts around the land; if you’re caught in it, you and your eagle are separated and you must find your way back to them in a rather basic stealth scenario in which you must avoid the boss’ gaze. This can frustratingly interrupt you in the middle of a puzzle, but the stakes are high enough to keep them from being meaningless: getting caught costs you some of your stash of crystals. And you’re always spit out right where you were, so it’s not as if that puzzle progress gets lost. But once a boss is defeated there’s no pressure whatsoever on how long you spend searching every nook and cranny for crystals and lightstones. I finished The Pathless’ story with a modest 40% or so of collectibles in about seven hours, and returning to try to collect everything has not only been a joy but some of my favorite parts of The Pathless. I imagine I’ll be spending many more hours just serenely running around this beautiful world.  The Pathless’ reliance on a simple but engaging movement system allowed me to explore Giant Squid’s beautiful open world with ease, placing its challenge more on the environmental puzzles you inevitably arrive at rather than on the journey itself. Its story may settle into some familiar territory, but it still finds ways to fascinate with this world and the history its landscape holds. I found myself easily getting lost in its varied regions, but I was never really “lost” - each new crumbling building or encampment rewarded me in some way for coming across it. Giant Squid’s thoughtful mechanics and layered puzzle design makes the very act of finding your way a thrill in and of itself. "
299,Bugsnax ,8.0,"Yes, it is indeed time to talk about Bugsnax. Young Horse’s oddball odyssey into the world of edible critters is jam-packed full of charm and humour that almost always prevents its sometimes repetitive, challenge-free gameplay from becoming a slog over the course of its 9 or 10 hours. It’s been difficult to tell by looking at its trailers, but this is a story-driven first-person adventure game with light puzzling and a surprising amount of emotional depth and character development and manages to tell a solid story, complete with twists and turns, along the way. And while not being much of a technical showcase for the PlayStation 5’s launch, Snaktooth Island is definitely a place worth visiting for the wildlife on show alone – just try not to eat too many. As has been evident from the start, Bugsnax is a game that revels in its own complete absurdity. As an intrepid news reporter you’ve been lured by the famous explorer Elizabert Megafig to cover Snaktooth Island’s unique wildlife, Bugsnax: walking, talking food that mutates the consumer's body parts upon consumption. Nothing about this is normal. Things get weirder still when you arrive and are thrust into an investigation of a mysterious disappearance.  Oh, by the way, both you and other villagers are grumpuses, a race of colourful, fur-covered bipedal mammals that walk and talk like humans. Again, nothing about this is normal. Whether you find ‘em hiding in the sand or tearing up a ketchup patch, though, it’s clear that each Bugsnak has been lovingly designed. There’s a distinct range in appearances and behaviours from flying pizzas to swimming soda cans and a personal favourite of mine the Spuddy, a tin-foil encased potato with a slice of butter on his head that loves nothing more than to charge foil-first and send you flying.   The main mission strand consists of getting the dozen or so residents of the island’s capital, Snaxburg, back home so they can be interviewed for information. The problem is that each grumpus has scattered to a different corner of Snaktooth and inevitably requires you to perform tasks for them in order to return. With Bugsnax being the only real sustainable food source on the Island, but not one that is overly easy to obtain, most missions follow a similar pattern: Locate the desired Bugsnak, catch the desired Bugsnak, then deliver the desired Bugsnak to the mission-giver. It’s a process that can become a little tired after a while, but never enough to the point of boredom. This is largely down to the excellent writing and voice performances throughout, and to the fact that each grumpus is very much their own character with their own beliefs and problems to solve. For example, the slack-jawed Wampus is a farmer who sees Bugsnax purely as a food source, so will naturally ask for you to gather them to plant in his garden. This puts him at odds with the well-intentioned Gramble, who is more at one with the ’snax and keeps them as pets. It’s these sort of power struggles and relationships that really help flesh out the cast of characters and lead you to learn a lot about them in a relatively short amount of time. It’s safe to say that by the end of the story I held much more of a connection to Snaktooth’s inhabitants than I ever imagined I would when I first stepped onto the island. A large amount of this has to be credited to the writers and the realistic conversations created in the context of a wholly unrealistic environment. It would be very easy at first glance to dismiss Bugnax as a gimmick-filled children’s game with nothing to say, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Much like the Pixar movies have mastered, there’s moments for all ages alike here. There are melancholic moments and serious subjects such as relationships, mental health, and loss broached in a delicate manner, as well as more overarching issues like climate change that are raised. These never feel forced or heavy-handed, however, and all serve the story and its characters in overwhelmingly positive ways.   That’s not to say there aren’t a whole lot of laughs to be had as well, and Bugsnax is genuinely funny on many occasions. It’s absurdist to the extreme at times, but what do you expect from a game that’s home to a tornado-conjuring flapjack with bacon for legs? Although a lot of my amusement did admittedly come from the various Bugsnax and the way they mutter their own names to themselves, the grumpuses have their moments to shine as well. Among my favourite cast members are the excellently named Cromdo Face, a surly red grumpus who seems to be possessed by the soul of Danny DeVito in Matilda, and Beffica Winklesnoot, who wouldn’t feel out of place by Rachel McAdams’ side in Mean Girls. If you can look past the purple fur and the hotdog for a leg, that is. “But how do you actually catch Bugsnax,” I hear you ask? Oh, if only it were that simple. There are over 100 different species of Bugsnax and a plethora of different methods of catching them. Your first step will always be to scan them by looking through your camera and pressing down on R2 to snag a snap of a ‘Snak. Incidentally, that’s a specifically satisfying button press if using the DualSense and its adaptive triggers, which imitate the clack of a camera’s shutter beautifully. The parallels between this and Pokemon Snap are easily drawn, but from there on Bugsnax becomes its own beast.  Once scanned, a Bugsnak’s likes, dislikes, and movement patterns will be revealed and you’ll have all the info you need to catch the kinda bug, kinda snack in your trap – but not necessarily all of the equipment. Bugsnax offers light metroidvania elements in that regard, by which I mean that there will be tools (a launch pad to catch flying Bugsnax, for example) that you’ll get later on and will have to return to previous areas to catch a Snaquiri that had been out of reach. Other solutions revolve around the use of various condiments like hot sauce or ranch dressing, to name a few. In order to catch a Bunger, for example, you’ll have to stun it first; luckily these angry whoppers charge at anything coated in ketchup, so slingshot a serving onto a couple of them and watch them knock each other out. On the whole, catching Bugsnax revolves around the same half-dozen different mechanics that you’ll have to use in different ways. This is just about enough variation to keep the quests from becoming stale, although admittedly by the time I reached the end of the story I had become a little tired of the gameplay loop. It ended just in time for me not to get full on Bugsnax. It takes around six or seven hours to mainline the story missions with another couple of hours added on if you choose to complete all of the side objectives. This is something I’d recommend doing, though – although some side missions are a series of dull fetch quests, others result in the most spectacular encounters Bugsnax has to offer. Without spoiling anything, the culmination of both Wiggle’s and Cromdo’s quests were, for me, a particular highlight that changed up the routine Bugsnax-catching gameplay significantly. That was a badly needed refresh because Bugsnax catching is what you’ll be doing 90% of the time. Thankfully there’s just about enough variety on offer even if I did yearn for a bit more of a challenge at times. Though it was rare that a moment gave me pause to think and work out how I was going to approach the puzzle, some did take a bit of ingenuity. The first time I caught a Cinnasnail was a particular moment that maybe shouldn’t have taken as long as it did.   Overall it’s the unabashed nonsense of Bugsnax that kept me interested throughout though. Without the great writing and constant joy of finding something you just haven’t seen before, it could so easily have been a stodgy, repetitive drudge of repetitive actions without any desire to see where it all leads. Fortunately, Bugsnax stays true to its principles throughout and just when you think you’ve worked it out its story, throws another left turn your way and lands an ending after a fantastic action-packed last 30 minutes.  Bugsnax is a light-lifting puzzle adventure that is elevated by its strong story and characters that I enjoyed until the very end. Despite some simple mechanics, the laughs outnumbered the groans significantly as I found myself surprisingly invested in the events of the island and its inhabitants. With over 100 Bugsnax to discover and catch there’s plenty here to entertain the completionists, alongside those just looking for a well-told six-hour mystery that will keep you guessing until after the credits roll. All of this while making you feel emotionally connected to the characters, something you previously might have thought sounded impossible. Until you saw a carrot crawl, that is. "
300,Assassin's Creed Valhalla ,8.0,"Like Assassin’s Creed Odyssey and Origins before it, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla continues the series trajectory into a full-fledged open-world RPG. Though Ubisoft has dug up some of its stealth-action roots to make that style more appealing, Valhalla’s focus is on the absolutely massive recreation of Dark Ages England, brought to life with stunning beauty and a level of detail I’ve rarely seen. It’s been an impressive showcase for the Xbox Series X (and presumably the PlayStation 5, but Ubisoft only gave us access to the Xbox version ahead of launch), playing in 4K and a near-constant 60 frames per second. You have to put up with some new progression system ideas that don’t quite deliver, and an abundance of bugs, but there’s a staggering number of things to do, explore, and discover in and around Valhalla’s more atmospheric storytelling.   The last time Assassin’s Creed tried letting us choose to play as a male or female protagonist the results were hit or miss, especially on the male side. Here, however, the performances of both the male and female versions of Eivor are admirable, though some accents drift a bit. (At one point I could’ve sworn female Eivor made a stop in Boston from the way she crushed the word “harbor,” but quickly enough it was back to Norse normal.) These brief moments are absolutely the exception to the otherwise steady and earnest delivery throughout, which is also true of most of the main characters. Outside the main cast, though some random NPCs can be a little… much. But special mention goes out to Sigurd, who channels fiery intensity and flirts with crazy in his performances, and that performance is accentuated by fascinating facial expressions that often lean uncomfortably close to the latter.   One particular instance found me helping the leader of a nearby shire – regions within the four kingdoms (no hobbits) – who had discovered a traitor in her inner circle and charged me with rooting them out because she loved each one of them as family and couldn’t trust herself to see past their lies. The resulting few hours of investigation brought me to the end of the road, and I made the best decision based on the available information I had. To be honest, I’m not sure I was right; I still don’t know. If the person I accused was guilty, Valhalla never gave me more clarity, and the uncertainty seems very intentional. My judgment was accepted and the consequences were swiftly doled out, and that was that. I’ve found myself thinking about that decision ever since. But that’s the business of eighth-century England, I suppose.  As I played it on the Xbox Series X, running 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, it may be the most beautiful Assassin’s Creed world yet; certainly the most satisfying to sit back and watch. The snow-blanketed tundras and mountainous ranges of Norway are breathtaking, especially at night as the aurora illuminates the sky above. The rolling green hills of England, cut up by iconic stone walls, are a ready canvas for the rays of light that pierce through the muggy cloud cover, casting shadows that slowly roll across the landscape. It’s hard to overstate how gorgeous a scene can be when the various lighting and weather effects systems are all working in unison. When I stormed the banks of a small riverside church, ready to pillage and plunder, the streaks of light bombarding the dense fog lit up the screen and enveloped the Christian cross in a scene that could’ve been pulled from a Dennis Villeneuve film, only with more heavy-handedness.  Beyond the beauty and thick atmosphere of the locales themselves, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla’s England is in turmoil. It’s home to clashes between Danes, Norse, Saxons, Britons, Picts, and more, all of whom have stuck a claim in one hunk of rock or another and will kill you to defend it – or to take it, depending on which side of the fence you happen to land on. It’s a confusing mess of integration that creates an excellent social and political knot into which to tie this story, compounded by cultural and religious elements that really drive a sense of otherness in the many different regions, even if they’re just down the river. But as all Assassin’s Creed games do, the undercurrent of Assassins versus the Order of the Ancients runs everywhere. It’s well represented in the various factions, and even in the decaying bones of the Roman Empire whose structures and architecture not only litter every region, but serve as excellent places to delve into the necessary long-forgotten tombs, crypts, and subterranean structures the series needs to hide its ancient order secrets. Again, that’s similar to Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, but much of the legwork of hunting down The Order is optional outside the main antagonists that inject themselves into your tale and force that storyline.   In fact, the Assassin’s Brotherhood elements that rope Eivor in start softly, slowly weaving in and out of their story with admirable restraint before the usual Dan-Brown-ification picks up and reveals everything is touched by these organizations in one form or another. But the focus rarely shifts completely from the Eivor’s more-engaging efforts to build a network of alliances throughout England’s four kingdoms and its many, many shires. One final note before we move on, without spoiling anything: as a huge fan of mythology, I’m stupidly excited for everyone to see Ubisoft’s interpretation of the Norse pantheon and Asgard. Tackling something so mystical and otherworldly had to be tough, but the end result is a more “realistic” and granular take on it than you’d be used to if your familiarity revolves around the Marvel Cinematic Universe or comic books. That’s not a slight on either, just an acknowledgement that this is a refreshing change of pace, especially considering how insane Norse mythology is when you get into the weeds.    Like many wars of that time, eventually you’re going to have to siege a castle or fortress, and that’s where Valhalla really cranks up the medievalness. These mass assaults often serve as the payoffs for longer quest chains, pitting your armies against whatever upstart king, jarl, or noble calls themselves lord of the lands you aim to conquer. These battles are fever-pitched and chaotic, and while they’re often impressive to look at they usually require a small checklist of orderly tasks to complete: ram the gates to smithereens, breach the inner keep, and kill the despot at the center. After a few of these you can start to pick up the patterns, but often they involve scouting defenses and softening up the opposition before going in, so that adds an element of strategy to it even if it eventually boils down to you taking on the big bad guy at the end. Still, breaking through fortifications with siege weaponry and working toward the inner keep is a very cool spectacle and captures the grandeur of all-out warfare that’s befitting a story of conquering kingdoms. But when you’re done pillaging on your raid or shoring up an alliance with the new ruler you’ve installed, it’s time to spend those supplies and raw materials. For that we return to the Settlement, a place to invest your resources that serves not only as your quest hub, but as a separate layer of progression with tangible benefits. As you begin to build out your settlement you’ll construct vital locations like a merchant to quickly buy and sell goods, a barracks to recruit and hand-pick your raiding party, a stable to buy mounts and upgrade riding abilities, a blacksmith to upgrade weapons and armor, and much, much more. On the surface, these are welcome additions and giving you stake of land to handle your business definitely beats tracking down merchants in the big wide world. It’s a little bastion of productivity that you’ll revisit again and again, and serves as the welcome “come home” location where you’ll plan your campaign across England, and dive into side character backstories and storylines.     The stat-driven RPG nature of this new era of Assassin’s Creed games has made this next to impossible because assassinations are subject to leashed power based on your enemy’s level and your overall effectiveness at dealing backstab-y damage. So unless you’re building into your stealth and assassination styles heavily, and trying to backstab enemies around your same level, odds are that when you stick them with the pointy end they take a ton of damage but don’t actually die, and have to be finished off with a decidedly un-stealthy battle. I can see how that’s frustrating for anybody who misses that kind of gameplay – especially since the series continues to trend toward emphasizing combat. Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, to Ubisoft’s credit, attempts to keep one foot on both sides, and it mostly succeeds thanks to a number of options that allow you to dial in your preferred style of play. The “vanilla” answer to this problem is in the skill tree. So if you play on the default difficulty, and default stealth difficulty (more on that in a minute), you can find ways to get closer to the original Assassin’s Creed style without going into the options menu. Specifically, there’s a skill called Advanced Assassination that allows you to overcome enemy level difference and power imbalance as long as you hit the quick-time event prompt. I love this approach, personally, because it puts the onus on you to perform and seal the deal if your timing is right. If it’s wrong, you’re going to pay for it when the big Viking turns on you and the alarm bells sound off. That’s the definition of a high-risk, high-reward playstyle. If that’s still not close enough to home, you’re in luck, because there’s an outside gameplay tool in the options menu called Guaranteed Assassination that allows you to assassinate ALL enemies in one shot, regardless of level, every time. However, it does come with the following note: “Please note that when choosing this option, you are not playing the game as it was intended to be experienced.” So, take that as you will (it’ll probably lead to some missions being laughably easy) but know that it’s there. Finally, if you really want to dial in your assassination experience, you’ve got some control over the difficulty settings to get you there. Just as you turn on Guaranteed Assassinations for that old-school feel, you can independently crank the combat difficulty up as far as you can stand it in order to punish yourself for getting caught. And you can tailor the stealth difficulty as well, which manipulates a number of factors in the stealth system to allow for an easier or harder approach. So there you go. If you’ve been on the “It’s not an Assassin’s Creed game anymore” train, Valhalla has a number of stops for you to hop off at should you take a detour through the options menu.    Those skills points you earn are spent on the Skill Tree, which is more of a web, linking various clusters of unlockable upgrades into constellations that you work your way through along the three main regions: combat, stealth, and ranged. On paper it’s a good system, and slightly reminiscent of Skyrim in style, but for me it’s ultimately a step backward, for two reasons. First, while you’ll know which direction to invest in from the start depending on what pillar you want to go toward first, once you’ve unlocked the skill at the center of the cluster you’ve got to decide which direction to move from there. Do you work toward the left, to the right? Normally you’d likely take a look at the skills further down the tree and figure out where you want to end up, but that’s the rub: every neighboring cluster is hidden by fog until you spend the necessary points to unlock the node that connects one cluster to another. What this means is you don’t know what the skill in the next group is going to be until you spend a few points to head that direction. That’s really frustrating early on, when you sink your valuable early points only to reveal a skill you don’t care about.   “But there’s still value in the smaller nodes between the main skills in each constellation,” you might say, being technically correct. And that’s true. But these nodes are only minor statistical upgrades, offering “+2 to melee” or “+1 to heavy melee attacks,” for example. Those are useful, but they’re numbers. Numbers aren’t fun. Wielding a two-handed greatsword in each hand so you’re a tornado of sharp edges? That’s fun! But do you know where that skill is? Not until you stumble upon it, or just look it up online. That’s not a great experience. Secondly, these unlockable skills at the center of the clusters are more passive, or augmentation to things you can already do, rather than the cool new abilities you’d normally find in a skill tree. Granted, a lot of them are incredibly useful – vital even – but while being able to stomp on a downed enemy or control an arrow you fire from a predator bow are very useful, they’re not as impactful as being able to light your weapons on fire or kick someone off a bridge to their doom. Those game-changing new abilities are hidden throughout the world in books of knowledge, so unless you’re exploring and hunting them from the get-go, the big-ticket abilities may not end up in your arsenal for dozens of hours. Because of this, for the first 10 or 15 hours I felt like Valhalla’s combat was underwhelming next to Odyssey’s bombastic style and flair. I was eventually proven wrong, of course, and it became as flexible, fluid, and brutal as ever after I unlocked enough skills and found enough abilities. But the whole system is skewed toward the mid-to-late game, which left me feeling fangless for over a dozen hours. It just takes way too long to start adding complexity to combat. So if this isn’t your first Assassin’s Creed game, know that the initial scuffles can seem very bland hack-and-slash affairs until you’ve started discovering some tools in the open world. iframe allowautoplay="""" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/gallery/37999/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery37999"" scrolling=""no"">  If you find one you like, you can invest collectible currencies to not only upgrade its level, which improves its stats, but upgrade the quality, and that often comes with a new visual appearance and always allows you to upgrade its level even further. It’s much less of a hassle and more rewarding in the long run than having to sift through two pages of greatswords, and weirdly allows me to grow more attached to them.   The other great change is in the greater flexibility and organic discovery of side quests and activities. Ubisoft has done away with the cascading list of side quests to track in favor of revealing colored-coded points of interest on the map for mysteries, wealth, and artifacts. Often you’ll find one of the many insane and light-hearted side stories – like one involving a crazy cat lady who happens to live next to a farmer whose field is overrun with rats (convenient!) – but it could also be a place of mystical power, a psychedelic hallucination challenge, or an ambush by bandits. These mysteries are, more often than not, much sillier than the main storyline, even farcical at times, but there are many that hide deeply unsettling secrets and deadly encounters. The beauty of the system is you don’t know what you’re getting into, but you’re free to walk away at any time knowing that pale dot will still be there waiting for you when and if you decide to come back. Ultimately, they’re excellent quick reprieves from the darker, heavier tones of the long, multi-part main story quests, and the freedom to pick what you want to pursue without obligation keeps the elements of surprise refreshing and engaging.     I’ve run into half a dozen hard crashes that returned me to the Xbox dashboard. I’ve cursed out loud at ore deposits and door barricades that just refused to break thanks to the attack animation of whatever weapon I was holding not connecting perfectly, I guess? I’ve avoided a number of staircases that snag you halfway up and refuse to let you do the one thing they were made to do. I’ve stood perfectly still as enemies ran tight, fast circles around me, or brazenly ignored the arrows I’ve buried in their heads. I’ve ridden nitro-powered rowboats that take flight whenever you dash onto the shore, and restarted Valhalla because quest progression came to a grinding halt when a vital NPC got stuck in a river or decided to just never move to begin with. I’ve looked past lingering HUD elements that overlap or stay on screen. I’ve raged against enemy Zealots – Valhalla’s version of mercenaries – that inexplicably regained health even when I was drowning them in a river or beating them to death with my bare hands, becoming effectively immortal. And friends, I swear to you, I’ve seen a flying whale.   Lastly, I don’t know if this is a bug or just a result of the developers wanting you to be able to do cool aerial attacks, but the fact you can survive a 100-foot fall by performing an attack in mid-air seems like the former. I’m not complaining, it helps speed up getting from point A to point B when I don’t want to look for a safe landing space, but it’s just so odd. Anyway, you get it. Valhalla is buggy – really buggy. That said, it wasn’t overpowering; looking back after over 60 hours played, all those nagging issues feel like small footnotes in what’s otherwise been many great hours of exploration and discovery. And, in the moment, I think it’s easy to miss out on the forest for the trees. So while I may never forget that flying whale, it’s not the first, or second, or even tenth thing I think about when I think of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla.  Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is a big, bold, and ridiculously beautiful entry to the series that finally delivers on the much-requested era of the Viking and the messy, political melting pot of England’s Dark Ages. It walks a fine line between historical tourism, top-shelf conspiracy theory, and veiled mysticism against the backdrop of a grounded and focused story. Fresh takes on several of the series’ established loot and quest systems help to keep the things fluid and nuanced, though progression could use refinement. There’s also a bigger than usual horde of bugs and blemishes to contend with from start to finish. But while it may not be the most stylish or polished, its rugged and brutal look at the muddy business of Scandanavian expansion is as memorable and dense as an Assassin’s Creed has ever been, and it makes great use of the new consoles.

301,Astro's Playroom ,8.0,"For a free game that comes with the PlayStation 5, one largely designed just to showcase all the bells and whistles of Sony’s next-gen DualSense controller, Astro’s Playroom is surprisingly fun. It’s not just a great toybox to experience the DualSense’s haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, microphone, and more, it also delivers the best proof-of-concept pack-in I’ve played since Wii Sports. This is a truly joyous homage to PlayStation history, as well as an experimental platformer I can only hope to see turned into a larger experience during the PS5’s lifetime. Developed by Team Asobi, Astro’s Playroom follows in the impressive footsteps of its excellent PSVR exclusive, Astro Bot: Rescue Mission. Much like that adventure crafted its levels and challenges around the concept of viewing a platformer in VR, here Team Asobi has really considered what it means to build one around the DualSense. You could technically play these levels without any of the DualSense’s new functionality, but like its predecessor Playroom serves as a strong argument for just how immersive an experience can be when fully using this new technology. Astro’s literal Playroom is, amusingly, the “inside” of your PlayStation 5 console, with its CPU Plaza hub offering you gateways to four main worlds: Cooling Springs, GPU Jungle, Memory Meadows, and SSD Speedway. Each offers a unique approach to conveying sensation through the DualSense and features its own platforming hooks, ranging from the just alright act of rolling a ball around using the touchpad in Memory Meadows to the enjoyable jumping frog suit of Cooling Springs to the stellar monkey climbing and swinging of GPU Jungle.   All of that is, fundamentally, tied around the fun of using the DualSense controller. As the first real showcase of how its haptic feedback allow players to “feel” things like the trudge of a character walking through mud, or the difference between being in water versus on a grassy plain, Astro Bot does an impressive job of showcasing the variety of what it can pull off. Water emits a light, wavy pulse through the controller to mimic Astro’s swimming, while ice offers light, consistent taps of rumble that are coupled with a simulated ice sound coming from the controller’s speaker. One way Astro Bot cleverly sows the seeds of these concepts – which do a remarkable job of consistently tricking my brain into buying into the different topography – is the lobby hallway ahead of each world. Before jumping into any of the locales (all of which are just a simple animation away, with no loading screens in between), the portal to each world features the type of terrain you’ll primarily encounter. So, before hopping into Cooling Springs, there’s a small pool for Astro to splash around in, or ahead of SSD Speedway, I can stomp around the mechanical mesh platforms that will blanket the upcoming levels. They’re the most subtle uses of the DualSense, but it’s a nice way to set the scene.  By Mike Epstein Verdict: With the DualSense, Sony has both made a more comfortable gamepad for traditional gameplay, and introduced some very exciting features. The haptics and adaptive triggers make an immediately noticeable difference in games that make use of them, and they offer the exciting potential for new and interesting gameplay experiences. Except for battery life, which remains a weak point, the DualSense controller is everything you want to see in a next-gen upgrade. Score: 9Read the full PS5 DualSense Controller ReviewBut once you do dive in, there’s no shortage of joy that comes from how Team Asobi has translated in-game surfaces, objects, and movement into different DualSense sensations. Hail hitting my bot on the head causes little pops of rumble to strike all around the controller, the pull of a bow and arrow requires some added pressure on the trigger coupled with the satisfying plunk of release as the arrow shoots out. But perhaps the aspects that best show how developers can successfully elicit the feeling of swimming through water or pushing against a gust of wind is when Team Asobi combines multiple DualSense features to produce a result greater than the sum of its parts. The combinations can be something simple like running a finger up the touchpad slowly to zip Astro into a new suit, while the realistic sound of a zipper cinching up plays and the DualSense thumps depending on how slowly or quickly you zip. Or it can become more complex, like the Memory Meadows-specific mechanic of a little spaceship suit Astro can wear, which uses both adaptive triggers to control the velocity of your ship’s thrusters, for which there’s also haptic feedback to indicate how much the ship is rumbling (or if you bump into any walls) while the rocket exhaust sound lowers and raises depending on how fast you’re going. Yes, the haptic feedback plays a big part in all this, like when raindrops start falling harder on Astro’s head and the pitter patter tremble of your controller simultaneously grows – but it’s the added hook of rain sounds emanating from the its speaker that really made me think “Oh no, I need to get out of this rain.” My favorite of them is GPU Jungle’s full robotic monkey suit, which leads to vertically-scrolling, 2D-view levels. As the monkey, Astro scales upward by grabbing onto rock climbing handholds, which require you to alternatingly grab on with a trigger (representing one hand), physically turn the DualSense left or right to raise the other arm, and then grab a subsequent handhold. Broken up by cables the monkey can spin around and launch off of, some handholds necessitate you only squeeze the trigger slightly or risk causing them to crumble and drop you to your doom, making this mechanic a real test of delicacy.   Other suits have Astro hopping into the aforementioned ship, which actually controls quite like the ships of digital PS3 classic PixelJunk Shooter – it can be quite easy to overshoot and hit an electrified wall, so there’s a nice balance of joyously zooming around and precise movement needed to survive. The frog suit of Cooling Springs is an absolute treasure in its DualSense use, though the levels are not necessarily my favorites. The reproduction of a spring coil via haptics, the triggers, and the speaker is outstanding, but I also found it unwieldy to actually aim and pretty easy to overshoot or just miss a precariously small landing spot.  strong>Verdict: It’s hard to overstate how incredibly different and exciting Astro Bot Rescue Mission’s new perspective is for the platform genre. The depth of the PSVR’s 3D leads to some truly incredible moments, like when Captain Astro leaps from eye level down to a trampoline metres below, only to bounce up and over your head. In almost every level I audibly gasped or smiled with delight, like when I needed to duck my head underwater to watch the little robot swim through some pipes or simply when Captain Astro would stand close enough to touch. The challenging platforming and natural implementation of VR make it one of the most interesting and genuinely new-feeling games in recent memory. Astro Bot Rescue Mission delivers on the potential of PSVR and is a must-buy for owners of the device. Astro’s Playroom’s little details like that ensure the DualSense lives up its name –- it’s not just called the DualTouch (which, let’s be frank, would be a terrible name) – genuinely making what I saw on screen more immersive. In fact, the only use of the DualSense that seemed superfluous to me was the microphone. I’ve seen uses like blowing into a mic to get an in-game fan to move since the days of the original Nintendo DS, so it doesn’t necessarily bring anything all that fresh here.  But the joy of Astro’s Playroom, while largely focused on its use of the new controller, is also thanks to Team Asobi’s dedication to turning this pack-in into a mini-museum of PlayStation history. The hidden puzzle pieces come together to form wall art murals tracing PlayStation console history all the way back to the original, while each of the main four worlds hold hidden artifacts belonging to the four respective eras of past PlayStation hardware. (And don’t worry PSP and Vita fans, you aren’t forgotten.) Some of these are more expected pieces, like recreations of the DualShock 4 or the PS2, but there are some appreciable deep cuts, like the PSP GPS plug-in, or throwbacks like the PocketStation. All of them are put on display to be looked at or hit to produce sound effects, pop open disc trays, and more.  As you’re exploring Playroom’s levels you’ll also stumble across Astro Bots wearing a blue cap and holding a camera. That’s the signal for a reference to a PlayStation game, and levels are littered with them – for example, you might find a boat with a robot inside that has a familiar tattoo, axe, and BOY alongside it, or a larger robot head made up of many smaller ones in a nod to LocoRoco. They’re mostly there for the fun of it all rather than to accumulate anything, but every single one of them made me smile, even the few that I had to take a moment to try and guess at. I won’t spoil any more here so as to not rob anyone of the joy of first discovering them. But, much like with the hardware artifacts, every era of PlayStation is represented in some truly hilarious ways. While hunting for realistic depictions of PlayStation systems or spotting a robot wearing the costume of a beloved PlayStation mascot may stick out, it all feels of apiece with Astro’s charming overall design. Running at a smooth 4K 60fps, Astro’s world may not be massive and require huge draw distances or populate the screen with hundreds of enemies, but it’s certainly pretty. Natural environments come together with PS5 internal parts and other pieces of hardware in a beautiful blend of the environmental with the technological. A grassy plain looks beautiful in 4K, only for the plants to be topped with PlayStation face button symbols rather than flowers. A rocky wall you need to climb has cliffs jutting out that… are actually recreations of trigger buttons. It is yet another sign of Team Asobi’s dedication to imbuing Astro with a sense of nostalgic fun when coming across the many ways they insert PlayStation references into the world. And that’s on top of the way it blends some audio Easter eggs into the world that are perhaps best discovered while playing. Astro’s Playroom surprised and delighted me. This PS5 pack-in most certainly hues closer to a technical showcase, essentially a loosely-structured sandbox to mess around in and discover what the PS5 has to offer. But it has enough collectibles, creative ideas, and genuinely exciting uses of the DualSense that PS5 owners shouldn’t brush this one aside in the launch lineup. After months and months of hearing how the DualSense would immerse me like never before, Astro’s Playroom put promises into practice and impressively proved what’s possible with the PS5’s new controller. "
302,Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales ,9.0,"Miles Morales may just be finding his footing as a superhero, but his first solo game proves developer Insomniac has comfortably hit its stride as it converts its stand-alone hit into a series. Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is a flashy starring debut for Miles, telling as engaging a story as the original Marvel’s Spider-Man while simultaneously improving upon pretty much every minor gripe I had with that already great game. It may be smaller overall, but every facet of it feels more essential: the incredible swinging mechanics, storytelling, and animation of Peter Parker’s adventure return, joined by meaningful updates to side missions, Miles’ flashy new moves, and the captivating spirit of New York City. While it can be played on PlayStation 4, this is a gorgeous introduction to the PlayStation 5. Miles Morales takes advantage of improved lighting and particle effects to make this former New Yorker achingly miss the city I once called home, and swinging feels even better at 60fps than at 30.  Marvel’s Spider-Man established Miles’ role alongside Peter Parker, and this solo outing makes it clear just how much room there is in Manhattan for multiple Spider-Men to shine. Actor Nadji Jeter returns to the title role and gives the newly heroic Miles a sincerity, heart, and excitement that stands tall alongside other depictions out there – from the Oscar-winning Into the Spider-Verse animated movie, to the original Brian Michael Bendis/Sara Pichelli comic run, and the ongoing Saladin Ahmed comic arc. This version stays true to Miles’ best stories in other mediums – mostly, he just wants to do right by Peter, his family, and his friends – while also making this take on the character feel fresh with something new to say. That, in part, comes from Miles discovering his way around his new home neighborhood of Harlem, both in and out of the suit. Spider-Man: Miles Morales follows in the smart storytelling footsteps of the original game (and many of the best Spider-Man stories) by making sure the events of life underneath the mask come head-to-head with the webhead’s trials and tribulations. And while on a gameplay level you’re free to explore the full map (which returns largely unchanged from Marvel’s Spider-Man) much of the story itself is rooted in or inevitably returns us to Harlem. As you explore the city, Miles Morales uses the same trick as the first game to flesh out Miles’ backstory, but to an even more investing degree. A host of time capsules from when Miles was younger offer a peek at his friendships and school life growing up, while an audio-focused collectible shines new light on his family. It’s an idea that feels born out of Miles as a character rather than a need to fill out the world, leading to some quite touching moments outside of the main story.    Of course, Miles’ story is filled with spectacular action alongside that story. Insomniac has found creative ways to work within the same overall setting of the original while not retreading too much of the same ground. Epic showdowns that send sparks flying, between new tech from the Tinkerer’s purples, Roxxon’s reds, and Miles’ own yellow bioelectricity offer beautiful, thrilling battles that range from boss fights that continue the first game’s strong tradition of memorable showdowns to street-level brawls that put Miles’ enhanced attacks to the test.    On the combat side, Miles’ has a few new tricks that mix up the fun – as do enemies. On the one hand there’s Miles’ bioelectricity, which is largely executed with L1 + a combo of face buttons. After charging a meter in combat, Miles can unleash temporarily paralyzing bursts of current that pack a wallop. Some of these Venom attacks (no relation to the symbiote guy)  focus on one foe, while others allow for crowd control, and yet more can help get an air combo going while warding off enemies. Mixing them in with Miles’ basics attacks not only saved me in the midst of a packed battle, but also adds so much stylish flair and variety to how I approached brawls. Those abilities also bring about one of the more fun uses of the PS5’s DualSense controller, as the crinkle of electricity discharging around Miles is simulated via its haptic feedback. You can hold down L1 to prep an attack and start to feel the rumble, while initiating a Venom-ified right hook will send a rumble from the left side of the controller through to the right. And Venom-infused takedown animations are beautiful, with electricity sparking and bouncing around Miles and foes in gorgeous fashion.  Speaking of DualSense, Spider-Man Miles Morales was my first fully fledged game where I got to use Sony’s new-gen controller and all its new bells and whistles. What excited me most turned out to be the small touches that elevated a scene, or helped root me to a specific location or emotional moment. Take the opening, for example: Miles is on a subway line to get to Harlem, and the thump of the train as it rattles along the tracks rhythmically pulses down the controller as Miles’ traincar approaches its stop. When Miles gets a text, his phone is in his right pocket, so only the right half of the controller buzzes. Little moments like this aren’t necessarily flashy, unbelievable or even essential uses of the controller’s technology, but it instantly has me excited for the potential of story-focused games to offer further immersion through the DualSense.  Another aspect that sets Miles apart is his cloaking ability, which allows him to become invisible for short bursts of time (a power tied to another meter). It can be used in the middle of a fight to confuse enemies or let you slip away to safety for a moment when things get dire. It’s also, naturally, a huge help if you choose to approach a scenario more stealthily. There’s nothing worse in a stealth combat section than being accidentally spotted by an enemy, and Miles’ invisibility can give you the time and space to react to compensate for the fact that you don’t personally have Spidey Sense. dir=""ltr""   When it comes to unlockable suits, Miles has a smaller collection than Peter overall, but there’s still a really solid mix of new, original suits and those inspired by his other appearances. I can’t talk about every suit just yet, but some of my favorites are unlocked via side missions and collectibles, and I’ve found myself switching between as many suits as I do powers, and much more often than I did with Peter’s. In particular, Insomniac nailed the Into the Spider-Verse suit. Easily my most anticipated and hoped-for look for Miles, the suit not only gets across the style of the film well in his exaggerated limbs, but its power to transform his animation style into that of the movie made my jaw go slack for a moment. Animating “on the twos” so that he appears to skip some frames may be out of sync with the rest of the world, but it is such a cool, well-integrated effect. It’s the suit Miles, and the movie it comes from, deserves.     iframe allowautoplay="""" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/gallery/40966/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery40966"" scrolling=""no"">That impressive level of detail is apparent in the characters as well. The citizens of New York are definitely still less fleshed out than the meticulously modeled main cast (and understandably so), but I did notice a bit more realistic movement and facial animations on them this time around in the side missions. And the work done on the main characters is some of the best real-life approximations I’ve seen from a first-party Sony game outside of The Last of Us Part 2. From the fur on Miles’ jacket hood, to the slight facial changes in a growing smile as he jokes around with Ganke, and more natural body movements in general, the animation really sings both in cutscenes and when swinging, flipping, and zipping across the world. Miles Morales on PS5 is as impressive to look at as it is to listen to. While I primarily played using my TV’s soundbar, I did test out Miles Morales’ use of 3D audio while wearing the PS5 3D Pulse headphones, and I found it made things come alive most in the smaller moments. Once I thwipped my way into Central Park and gracefully leaped onto a bridge only to scare away a flock of birds on a frozen pond, and when they shot into the sky and fluttered around me I could hear their irritated caws realistically rising and surrounding me. Car horns and conversations carry as Miles’ position moves and the camera moves around, and you can hear enemy projectiles whiz by in the midst of battle. It’s all fun and engrossing as a good first outing with this fancy new PS5 tech, but not necessarily essential; if you’re playing with TV speakers, a soundbar, or other set-up it’s still great. And even outside of the city's soundscape, the fantastic, driving score and licensed tracks are an energizing delight – I'd like this soundtrack on vinyl ASAP, please. And it’s all an open-world city with pretty much no load times once you start up Miles Morales. Fast-travel has no time for a funny subway loading animation like Peter’s adventure, and shifts between indoor locations for story missions to cutscenes back to gameplay is nearly instantaneous thanks to the PS5’s SSD. Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales may not be quite as packed with content as the original, but it stands out as an essential story in Insomniac’s Spidey Universe. It earns its spot as a fantastic follow-up, telling a wonderful Miles-specific story while improving upon the fundamentals of the first game with distinctive moves and enemies. And it’s an excellent way to break in your new PlayStation 5; it looks spectacular, loads fast, and makes fun use of the DualSense controller, the directional audio, and more. But regardless of which generation you play it on, it’s a worthy followup to one of the best superhero games ever made. "
They say if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it – and 2010’s Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit definitely ain’t broke. On the one hand, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered is about as barebones as remasters come: other than sprucing up the visuals, adding a few more decorative objects around the tracks, and introducing a garage for showing off cars between events, there isn’t much surprising or new here. But on the other hand, that’s a big part of why this is a straightforward remaster done right, giving a much needed tune up and a fresh coat of paint to an already awesome arcade racer. Criterion Games came out swinging when EA first handed it the reigns to the Need for Speed franchise a decade ago. As its first outing, Hot Pursuit brought the sense of reckless speed and excitement that Criterion was known for from its Burnout games, revitalizing the Need for Speed series and still standing as one of its best games. It says a lot about just how great it is that, with minimal changes, Hot Pursuit feels and plays just as good today as it did back then.   From our November 2010 Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit review by Ryan Geddes: ""Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit is pure over-the-top driving entertainment. The cars and environments are gorgeous, the crashes are spectacular, and the new Autolog feature breathes new life into the time-honored tradition of video game competition among friends. The single-player races can become somewhat repetitive and there are some presentation issues, but overall, Hot Pursuit is a blast. If you’re looking for a high-octane racer that grabs on tight but doesn’t take itself too seriously, give this one a shot.""    Part of what keeps it so great is how it excels so well at the very specific thing it sets out to do: romanticize fantastical and over-the-top car chases. There’s an overworld map with various locations that have you control either street racers or cops, acting as either the chased or the chaser, respectively, during any given event. As you complete challenges and increase your bounty, you slowly unlock new cars and new regions. That’s it – there are no upgrades to worry about or complex customization features. Pick a color and hit the road. It’s that simple. It also nails that delicate balance between looking incredibly gorgeous and realistic (even at blistering 200 MPH+ speeds) while also being easy to control with its arcade-style physics. Yes, you need to brake around corners and feather the gas a little bit to catch the right drift on turns, but it requires far less precision than something like Project CARS or Gran Turismo. Drifting around bends effortlessly, weaving in between opponents during a race, and just barely overtaking a cop car before the next curve is a special brand of intensity that’s unmatched elsewhere. There’s something about Hot Pursuit's style and presentation that hearkens back to a simpler time when racing games were just about racing with no frills or filler – and without feeling like it’s missing features. dir=""ltr""  Most events can be completed in under five minutes, and some far quicker than that. Those include straight up races, intercept events to chase down rogue vehicles, car chases, and more. I’m not a huge fan of the race “Preview” events, which generally boil down to having to do time trial runs through a course before you unlock its actual events, but it does help you get acclimated to that level’s turns. I particularly enjoyed stages near the coast with nice vistas or anything wet from rain since the lighting and reflections are great eye candy. And if you just want to cruise around without stressing about the competition, every region includes a Freeride option as well. One of the best parts of Hot Pursuit is all the little gadgets you get access to during events, like spike strips you can drop behind you to try and take out opponents or the road blocks you can call in as a cop to slow down your target. Growing up on games like the original 1998 Hot Pursuit on the first PlayStation and the slew of racers it influenced, such as Burnout, trained me to enjoy recklessly ramming into cars in all racing games. So it’s nice to have another that encourages and rewards that behavior here. This is a remaster though, not just an uprezzed port. Several of the courses have new cosmetic objects like road signs, dividers, and background details with trees and foliage. The actual roads themselves follow the same paths as before, but every area looks and feels more alive now. Not to mention the sleek vehicles themselves that look nice and sharp without the fuzzy jagged lines you’d see in games last generation. On PS4 Pro and Xbox One X, Hot Pursuit hits either 60FPS at 1080p in Performance Mode or 30FPS at 4K in Quality Mode. The PC version can hit 4K and 60FPS if your system can handle it, while the Nintendo Switch and standard PS4 and Xbox One are limited to 30FPS at 1080p. After trying out both modes on a PS4 Pro, I found myself preferring the higher framerate of Performance Mode because everything is moving so quickly you don’t really have time to appreciate the 4K rendering as much, but the more fluid animations at 60FPS really help smooth out the speed. dir=""ltr""  And while there isn’t much in the way of brand new content, the main menu does have a nifty garage now where you can check out all the cars you’ve collected so far – and there are some absolute gems, including my personal favorite the BMW Z4, which looks like the kind of car you’d like to just go for a drive in on a lazy weekend (and crashing it is oddly therapeutic). All of the original’s DLC is included in this single package, which is a nice bonus if not strictly new. You can now also take full advantage of all these shiny cars by pausing any race to access a robust photo mode (available in the garage as well), which even has an excellent feature that lets you toggle on or off mid-race damage. The paint options for every car in the roster have impressively expanded as well, even if other customization features aren’t available. In the original game you could pick from just a few pre-selected colors before starting a match, but now there is a custom color palette wheel that lets you pick pretty much any color you could ever want. I usually went with a gaudy neon blue, which is a very intimidating color as everyone knows. It’s not very deep customization, but the increased option is still a welcome tweak. The Autolog feature also returns here with its ‘Wall’ concept that shows a collection of times and accomplishments from all of your friends as a real-time representation of how much better (or worse) you are than everyone within your skill range. Nowadays racing games thread a lot of this data into races themselves, but Autolog still helps round things out here by funneling you towards activities your friends are also doing. There’s proper online multiplayer for up to 8-players too (which works with cross-play), but I didn’t have a chance to try that prior to this review. Based on my experience with the original in 2010, my favorite online mode was Most Wanted, which has one player trying to escape with a small team of other racers helping them – kind of like a VIP escort mission in other multiplayer games – while a team of cops try to take them out. There’s also all of the same formats from the Career mode like the titular Hot Pursuit, in which you must take out street racers, but we won’t know how well any of them function before playing on live servers. Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered feels as great as it did in 2010, and modernizes the graphics just enough to make it look as good as I remember the original looking at release on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. But with little new here other than those improved visuals and some nifty cosmetic additions, this is definitely the bare minimum expectation of a remaster. That’s a bit of a bummer as we head into an ambitious new generation of consoles this month, but Hot Pursuit still holds up as a great game in its own right. Races are blistering fast, the car selection is mouth-watering, and the high-speed dances between opposing cars never gets old. "
304,Yakuza: Like a Dragon ,7.0,"The Yakuza games have always been about smacking people in the face with traffic cones, bicycles, and street signs, but the development team behind Yakuza: Like a Dragon has taken arguably the boldest swing in the series to date. A shift from the reflex-testing beat-’em-up action of previous games to a more structured, turn-based JRPG-style combat system seemed like a genuine gamble when it was first revealed, but the end result successfully manages to introduce a more tactical form of team-based street fighting without sacrificing any of the series’ signature flair and offbeat humour. A lengthy late-game level grind made completing its story more of a drudge than it needed to be, though, meaning that although I found Like a Dragon to initially be as refreshing as a can of Suntory Highball, by the end I felt as weary as someone who’d had a few cans too many.   Main protagonist and ex-Yakuza clan member Ichiban Kasuga is a likeable hero who wears his heart on the sleeve of his apparently mandatory leisure suit. However, it’s the engaging ensemble that he forms with the three other core characters alongside him in his justice-seeking quest – grizzled detective Koichi Adachi, doctor-turned-vagrant Yu Nanba, and cabaret club hostess Saeko Mukouda – that really sets Yakuza: Like a Dragon apart from its predecessors in terms of drawing me into its world. Exploring the backstreets of Yakuza games on your lonesome has always been enjoyable in the past, but it turns out it’s even more fun with a few colourful friends along for the ride – especially when their lighthearted banter offers insight into each location as you wander around. Being a Yakuza game, Like a Dragon never suffers a shortage of street thugs waiting to bully you out of your bento box money when you’re just innocently heading down to the arcade to play some OutRun. Yet while you might assume that a switch to turn-based combat would slow the speed of each brawl down to a crawl, combat still manages to feel fluid and energetic despite the pauses in between individual attacks. Although you aren’t given any direct control over the position of each member of your party in the skirmish, every character in the scrap is in constant motion, and that helps each battle feel dynamic. Additionally, the option to reduce incoming damage by tapping the guard button in real-time and the ability to knock an enemy off their feet and then quickly follow up with a more damaging strike in the short window of time before they recover kept me locked in during every fighting moment.    Yakuza: Like a Dragon’s job system is also unlike any other I’ve ever experienced, although not necessarily in a good way. Jobs allow you to change the class of each character in order to tailor their skill set to your ideal playstyle, but the problem is that these jobs aren’t particularly well-defined at a glance. Rather than offer more established RPG classes like warrior, mage and cleric, Yakuza: Like a Dragon instead features around a dozen or so different jobs with names like Host, Chef, and Dealer (as in cards, not drugs), and although you’re able to  browse their individual lists of special attacks it’s hard to get a full understanding of how they play without picking one and then committing the time to level it up long enough to unlock the full suite of its special attacks. If you guess wrong, that’s a lot of time sunk into a class you don’t especially want to play. As a result, I dabbled with a few of the jobs but ultimately stuck with the default selection for the majority of the seven playable characters in my party, with the main exception being Saeko, who I switched from Hostess to Idol in the early game on a whim. That move fortunately paid dividends later on by offering invaluable healing support during Yakuza: Like a Dragon’s toughest enemy encounters. There are also some issues evident in the battle system that regularly impact the flow of each fight. Most notably, the automatic pathfinding of each of your party members is often unreliable, particularly indoors or when there are a number of objects to navigate around. In those scenarios, I’d often select an attack and then watch as my character got stuck in a wall for a while before teleporting to their target. This can be especially annoying when you’ve strategically waited for a group of enemies to move into a tight bunch in order to unleash an attack with a wide area of effect, like Kasuga’s bat-swinging Giga Smash, only for the group to have dispersed by the time your dawdling character manages to make their way over to the target. But overcoming confused pathfinding is a relatively minor molehill compared to the Mt. Fuji-sized spikes in difficulty that awaited me in Yakuza: Like a Dragon’s third act. For the first 20 hours I had progressed relatively unimpeded, and arrived at the start of the 12th story chapter (out of 15) with my party members each at around level 31. It’s here that I was suddenly met by a pair of level 50 boss characters with the ability to unceremoniously wipe out my entire street fighting squad in a single hit. Chapter 12’s misleading name is ‘The End of the Yakuza’, and after several ill-fated attempts at taking these two super-powered enemies out, it was also very nearly the end of me.  In chapter 12, however, you gain access to the Sotonbori Fighting Arena, which is a little more interesting the first time you play through it since each of its 30 floors presents unique battle conditions and bonus items for clearing them within a certain number of moves. Yet neither of these two dungeon areas appear to feature enemies that scale with you each time to restart them, meaning you only see relatively diminishing XP returns with each subsequent trip – your party grows stronger while the enemies stay the same. And I had to revisit each of them an exhausting number of times before I could successfully battle my way through the sharply escalating series of boss fights that awaited me at Yakuza: Like a Dragon’s conclusion. All up I’d estimate that I spent around 10 to 15 hours in the late game grinding my way to levels high enough to be able to overcome those last few bosses. When you consider my overall story completion time was just under 45 hours, that’s not an insignificant portion devoted to repetitive busywork. I’m all for turn-based fighting in the street, but grinding for XP really isn’t up my alley, particularly since it came at the worst possible time, slowing my progress through the story to a halt just as it was very clearly trying to accelerate towards its climax. Truly the closing chapters of this latest Yakuza story felt less Like a Dragon, and more like a drag. Although the repetition required to scale its steeping difficulty curve wore me down towards the end, one thing I never got tired of was merely existing within Yakuza: Like a Dragon’s Yokohama setting. In a year where many of us have barely visited neighbouring cities let alone countries, the virtual tourism aspect of this latest Yakuza game felt more valuable to me than it ever has before in the series. Not only is Yokohama much larger than the Kamarucho and Osaka areas from previous games (both of which can also be visited in Yakuza: Like a Dragon), it’s also far more diverse; with a beautiful bay area, seedy red light district, vibrant Chinatown section, and more to wander around, and each is home to their own landmarks and peculiar side characters to interact with.  In fact, possibly the biggest upside to the more expanded RPG elements of Yakuza: Like a Dragon is that there’s a meaningful gameplay benefit to almost every little interaction and activity you can undertake while exploring Yokohama. You can, for example, sit for exams at the vocational school to boost Ichiban’s intellect and thus make him less susceptible to brainwash attacks during a battle, or share a drink with a specific party member at the bar thereby boosting your bond with them and enabling them to level up faster when they’re not in the active party. While the grinding loops I endured late in its main story path had me wearily watching the clock, very little outside of the story ever felt like a waste of time and effort. Yakuza: Like a Dragon’s colourful turn-based combat, engaging lead characters, and detail-rich setting make for a refreshingly different and mostly thrilling instalment in the long-running Japanese crime series. However, pathfinding annoyances and a number of escalating difficulty spikes in its closing chapters made completing its story feel like much more of a repetitive slog than any of the previous games. While I applaud the developers for daring to transform its established brawling into more tactically complex team-based battles, the grueling progression system it brings along with it means that Yakuza: Like a Dragon ultimately takes some bold steps in a new direction for the series but neglects to completely maintain its balance.

305,Pokémon Sword and Shield: The Crown Tundra DLC ,9.0,"Like the harsh and snowy climate it's set in, the final DLC for Pokémon Sword and Shield’s season pass is an add-on designed with the most hardcore Pokémon players in mind. The Crown Tundra puts open-world exploration and legendary Pokémon front and center, taking full advantage of the base game's best innovation: wild areas. But while it succeeds in being another entertaining addition to Sword and Shield like The Isle of Armor before it, its weak story is similarly short-lived – and its exciting legendary hunts end with classic, grindy encounters that will have you praying to lady luck. The second part of the Pokémon Sword and Shield expansion pass takes you to the Crown Tundra, an icy mountain region filled to the brim with powerful pocket monsters and frostbitten senior citizens. Like The Isle of Armor DLC, The Crown Tundra is one giant wild area where you’re given 360 degrees of control over the camera and Pokémon roam freely. Unlike wild areas before it though, The Crown Tundra actually makes much better use of the open-world sandbox by cramming it full of legendary Pokémon to track down and secrets to discover. You might find yourself solving a series of riddles to track down some legendary giants or cooking curry to lure out a reclusive unicorn. Though there’s only a few hours of legendary-hunting to be had in total, it’s definitely some of the best content in all of Pokémon Sword and Shield.   From our November 2019 Pokemon Sword and Shield review by Casey DeFreitas: ""Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield are closer to my dream Pokemon RPGs than anything that’s come before. I’d still like better cutscenes, companion Pokemon, the complete Pokedex, and a more visually interesting Wild Area, but nitpicks are just not very effective when everything else was such a complete joy to play. The way they respect my time is wonderful, and the removal of monotony from random encounters and other odds and ends distills it down to only the pure and charming fun of capturing, training, and battling wonderful creatures. And hey, if I’m missing any tedious repetition, I can always get back into breeding.""  The main story of The Crown Tundra focuses on Calyrex, a psychic/grass-type Pokémon with the awesome and disturbing power to possess humans and use them as meat puppets… and also the power of growing crops. After losing both of those powers and roaming the world as a forgotten deity for generations, you’re entrusted with reuniting Calyrex with its lost steed and restoring it to its former glory. Though the story lacks any real drama or surprises, it does manage to make Calyrex an interesting character who I genuinely cared about, even if the little guy is kinda creepy sometimes. As you hunt for legendaries and lend Calyrex a helping hand, you’ll also spend a lot of time with Peony, a wacky, adventure-crazed former gym leader who serves as your partner throughout the journey. Peony is an entertaining tour guide and bursting with personality, but the storyline and relationship between him and his daughter, Peonia, feels underused and somewhat out of place in this legendary quest. I was expecting the relationship between father and daughter to ultimately serve as a metaphor that the real legendary Pokémon we should strive to capture is family or something, but instead they just made some jokes about how dads are annoying, which is cool too, I guess. dir=""ltr""  Rather than railroading you straight to the linear main quest with Calyrex though, The Crown Tundra offers a more open format with dozens of legendaries to chase in whatever order you choose. Apart from the primary questline, there are a few fun guided legendary expeditions that will account for most of your time in this DLC, like hunting a trio of legendary birds or following footprints to track down some familiar stag-like creatures. There are also secrets and hidden legendaries beyond the basic shopping list for truly dedicated and sharp Pokémon masters to seek out, some of which were actually pretty fun and tricky to puzzle out. This looser formula pairs perfectly with the open-world wild area concept, granting a greater sense of exploration than one might expect from Pokémon. Unfortunately, the traditional structure of catching legendary Pokémon doesn't do this exciting newer method of finding them justice. Since The Crown Tundra mostly focuses on legendaries, you’ll spend a lot of your time throwing Poké Balls at opponents with extremely low capture rates in classic Pokémon fashion, and watching them break out again and again is a sour way to conclude an otherwise entertaining hunt. There’s little you can do to improve your odds aside from the usual methods of lowering a Pokémon’s health, dishing out a status effect, and then hucking different types of balls over and over until you get lucky. In one instance, this led me to throwing all manner of Poké Balls, including plenty of Dusk Balls and Timer Balls, for almost an hour before successfully capturing my target. It's not a new feeling for any experienced Pokémon player, but the novelty runs out pretty quickly when legendaries are such a large part of this DLC. dir=""ltr""  Thankfully there are more than just legendaries in The Crown Tundra, and with this new area comes more than 70 returning regular Pokémon, including welcome additions like Aerodactyl, Jynx, and Dragonite. As with The Isle of Armor, this expansion does not fully solve the problem of an incomplete Pokédex, with over 200 past Pokémon still missing in action, but it does add enough to make capturing all the new and returning ones quite alluring, especially for completionists like me. One of the main draws of The Crown Tundra is “Dynamax Adventures,” an awesome new game mode that seems to take inspiration from roguelike games. This mode acts like a boss rush for the base game's Max Raid Battles: you’re randomly assigned a Pokémon to use alongside three online teammates (or AI when playing solo) and have to fight through a series of Dynamax battles with opportunities to swap and upgrade your Pokémon as you progress. At the end of each adventure waits a legendary Pokémon which can be captured if you manage to defeat it.  The Crown Tundra and The Isle of Armor can only be purchased together as part of Pokemon Sword and Shield's Expansion Pass. Here's what I said in my June 2020 review of The Isle of Armor: ""The Isle of Armor is a solid first attempt at DLC in a Pokémon game, even if it’s too short-lived to offer anything that feels like a truly substantial addition beyond the location itself. While the new Wild Area is beautifully crafted and the exciting selection of returning Pokemon are fun to catch, the shallow campaign feels like a waste of their full potential.""    The great thing about Dynamax Adventures is that they actually present a real challenge since you aren’t able to rely on your own powerful Pokémon to carry you through to victory. And since your entire team is only allowed four faints for the entire run, you’ll have to play smart to overcome your opponents and have a shot at the legendary that lies in wait at the end. With so many legendaries available through this mode, there’s plenty of reasons to return and fill out your roster. A less interesting addition is the Galarian Star Tournament, a mode that pits you and a recognizable NPC teammate from Sword and Shield's story against opposing duos in a series of competitive bouts. While it’s fun to revisit and even fight alongside some of the charming characters from the campaign, there aren’t a ton of incentives to do so  – especially when hours of grinding it largely just results in two very disappointing unlockable characters. Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield are closer to my dream Pokemon RPGs than anything that’s come before. I’d still like better cutscenes, companion Pokemon, the complete Pokedex, and a more visually interesting Wild Area, but nitpicks are just not very effective when everything else was such a complete joy to play. The way they respect my time is wonderful, and the removal of monotony from random encounters and other odds and ends distills it down to only the pure and charming fun of capturing, training, and battling wonderful creatures. And hey, if I’m missing any tedious repetition, I can always get back into breeding. "
306,Watch Dogs: Legion ,8.0,"After decades of running over pedestrians by the dozen in open-world action games without a second thought, it’s actually a little bit unsettling to think that each of them might have unique talents and even the potential to be a hero. Not so much that I drive more carefully or anything, but after playing Watch Dogs: Legion I think about it a little bit more. Legion’s clever twist makes this third game in the series play like a hacker version of State of Decay, where every NPC can be recruited as a playable character and each has their own weapons, abilities, and traits that can give them very different playstyles. That lends it a much more sandboxy feel than the previous games because any given character can make the same mission feel dramatically different. It can be rough and experimental in places, but I have to hand it to Ubisoft for being willing to take chances like this.   There aren’t a lot of direct connections to the previous two games, but the story still centers around the DedSec hacker/vigilante group, this time serving as a resistance movement against a techno-fascist police state that’s clamped down on Britains’ freedom after a major terrorist attack (blamed on DedSec). There are some overt political themes in play here, such as privatizing the police being a bad idea, how giving up personal privacy for convenience and security is a good way to end up in a dystopia, and maybe immigrants shouldn’t be rounded up into camps and deported. These folks are less powerful than a typical action game character because they never individually gain new abilities like Aiden and Marcus did. It can feel a bit limiting to only have access to a few weapons and skills at a time, but it’s actually kind of refreshing to not play as a jack of all trades. I did feel like I’d seen most of what Legion had to offer in the first third of the campaign, but finding new and unique people to play as refreshed it every once in a while. Happening across a street magician who dresses like a high-tech pimp was the shot in the arm my playthrough needed, especially because his special ability is to hypnotize an enemy to fight for you in the middle of combat. He’s become a favorite of mine.   Legion is much more concerned with piloting drones, and there are a few obstacles courses you have to navigate with flying drones that are more interesting diversions from the regular gameplay anyway. Many areas also integrate the same power-flow puzzles from Watch Dogs 2, overlaying their rotatable nodes onto the real world with augmented reality and sometimes asking you to complete them while under fire. They’re rarely very tricky but it’s still a very clever approach to puzzle gameplay.  The most interesting characters play substantially differently. You can use someone with lots of heavy weapons (like a military veteran) to shoot your way through most missions with relatively straightforward gunfights, or just about anybody can use cameras and tiny spider drones (fact check: they only have six legs, they are not spiders!) to reach an objective and hack it without ever physically setting foot in an encounter area. Alternatively, recruiting a member of the private police corporation and using them to infiltrate guarded areas plays like a Hitman game, since you can stroll through undetected as long as you don’t let anybody get too close a look at you. There are a lot of possibilities, and the intricate level design goes a long way toward enabling you to come up with different ways to approach most of the scenarios – including using the construction worker’s slow-flying cargo drone to bypass half a mission.   However, this leaves the money you earn feeling pretty useless, since it’s only used to unlock clothing options that have no impact on gameplay. Similarly, just like in Watch Dogs 2, the emphasis on non-lethal weaponry is puzzling because it functions pretty much identically to bullets and no one seems to be keeping track of how many corpses you leave in DedSec’s wake – that’s all just for us to roleplay as non-murderous vigilantes if we chose to, I suppose. One of the most daring alterations to the typical open-world action game setup that Legion makes, though, is that these characters are all expendable, and that changes the way death works in very affecting ways. By default, getting shot, beaten down, or blown up in a mission sends a character to the hospital or prison and they’re unavailable while they recover or pay their debt to society, as represented by a timer on their portrait in the Team screen. But if you’re playing with permadeath enabled (as I did) the stakes of every mission immediately feel much higher than in any GTA-style game I’ve ever played.   In general, though, it’s not too hard to stay alive if you’re careful. Your health recharges quickly if you can avoid damage for a few seconds, so even when things look dire a tactical retreat can save your bacon. A cheap upgrade allows you to do a free melee instakill on a bad guy every 30 seconds or so, which makes it easy to get out of trouble when you’re caught sneaking around (provided you’re not in a crowded room). And thankfully there’s barely any fall damage, because dying because you misjudge a jump by a few feet would be an awful way to go. Even if you do lose some people, or if they’re randomly kidnapped off the street (yes, this happens quite a bit) don’t worry: it’s going to be fine. Yes, your game will end if you have no more agents available, but getting more isn’t hard and Bagley will frequently point you toward new elite types to recruit. More than that, I’ve found I’ve earned a fair number of recruits just by marking people I see who have potential for later recruitment (effectively saving them so you can do their recruitment mission later) and then happening upon ways to earn their loyalty almost by accident. For instance, you’ll occasionally see a character with a red icon over their heads identifying them as an adversary of someone you know, and eliminating them will earn you a new recruit. Those aren’t the only connections you’ll spot: icons over random pedestrians’ heads will indicate that they’re related to one of your recruits somehow, either by family or friends or lovers. One time I came across an elderly woman with an icon over her head, and when I scanned her it revealed she was the grandmother of one of the characters I’d gotten killed, saying he’d died fighting for something. That was a nice little touch that added to the illusion of all of these NPCs being actual people.    Traditionally, Watch Dogs games have come with some innovative multiplayer modes, such as the hide-and-seek style invasions and creative car chases. Legion does promise four-player co-op… later. It hasn’t been switched on yet – that’ll come in a free update in early December, Ubisoft says. Currently, there’s no multiplayer at all.      Watch Dogs Legion takes Ubisoft’s open-world hacker series in an interesting new direction by letting you swap between the inhabitants of a near-future London almost at will. There’s enough variety in the way different characters play to make that a good tradeoff for not having one traditionally progressing character with a fleshed-out personality, and playing with permadeath enabled ratchets up the tension of infiltrating heavily guarded areas. On top of that, the map is detailed and loaded with environmental puzzles to solve with a little help from your drones. Legion is technically a little rough, but its sandbox-style approach is a good idea that sets Watch Dogs’ moment-to-moment gameplay even further apart from the GTA series. "
307,Netflix's Barbarians: Season 1 ,6.0," German TV series Barbarians, presented in (a less-than-ideal) English dub, is ready to stream on Netflix. Now, if you're looking for a more interestingly-presented Roman invasion story then you'll do better with Epix's insane import Britannia. But if you're in the mood for a straight-forward slice of humdrum histrionics then Barbarians, which is about the build to the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in ancient Germania, might suffice in a pinch.   The Romans have conquered Germanic lands occupied by an assortment of splintered, bickering tribes, and the famous Teutoburg Forest tussle involved many of these warring townships banding together to take out Roman legions. It's a classic underdog, rise-from-the-ashes war story that feels ready-made for a series all about sticking it to history's cruel and arrogant arch-nemesis, the Roman Empire. Many ""famous figures"" make up the roster here, from Gaetano Aronica's General Varus to Jeanne Goursaud's Thusnelda to Laurence Rupp's Arminius. Barbarians looks decent enough, production-wise, for a series that more or less takes place between a village, a camp, and the trees between the two, though it never rises up above a modest roar from a story standpoint. The most interesting element in Barbarians is Rupp's Arminius. The viewer enters the tale after the Romans have already been in control of the surrounding area for years. Arminius, long ago, as the child of a local tribal chief, Segestes of the Cherusci, was given away by Segestes to Varus in order to ""keep the peace"" - much like you've maybe seen on this season of Fargo. Varus takes Segestes' sons as hostages for the good of the land and raises them as his own. So here's Arminius, now a grown man, who doesn't quite belong in either world, having to decide what to do when the Romans begin squeezing the Germanic people for all they're worth and essentially starving them. Complicating Arminius' crisis of conscience even further is his childhood friendship with Cherusci maiden Thusnelda and local rogue Folkwin Wolfspeer (David Schütter). The dynamic between these three, even as Folkwin is a made-up character for the show, gives Barbarians its best and most emotional material. Because while Arminius exists as the only one left behind (or taken away, to be specific) he also might be the only solution to everyone's dire needs. So resentment, jealousy, confused allegiances, and hard sacrifices all come into play when these three are the central part of the saga. When they're not at the heart of the story, however, and when Barbarians chooses to be about other things, it all-too-easily slips into mediocrity. The show can quickly get overrun by a rogues' gallery of tropes and tediums that make it rather indistinguishable from most other sword-and-sandal costume dramas: from conniving side characters, supernatural teases, and overbearing speeches. Nothing is altogether new here. Barbarians delivers a few cliches decently, but the rest of them just sort of hover in a fog. On top of this, the narrative shifts quite a bit over the course of this first season to the point where you're never quite sure, from one episode to the next, what the focal point is. Eventually, Arminius rises up through the ranks to become, more or less, the central figure, though it's at the expense of a more interesting story sometimes. Granted, this could also be because the story follows an actual particular course of history and you can't exactly abandon that just because other themes are working better. Barbarians is perfectly okay underdog fare for those who enjoy solemn and straight-forward dramatizing of tide-changing historical battles. There are moments throughout the season when Barbarians finds a creative high with its three leads but, alas, history dictates most of the saga here and not necessarily the best story. "
308,Ghostrunner ,8.0,"There is no shortage of great ninja-centric video games out there, from Ninja Gaiden to Metal Gear Rising to more recent gems  like Katana Zero. But even among those, Ghostrunner stands out by being 100% committed to delivering that fantasy of becoming a super fast and deadly assassin. This is a game where you run fast, slide fast, kill fast, and if you can’t do those things fast enough, you die fast. It can be very demanding and requires pinpoint platforming precision and split second decision making, but it’s rarely ever frustrating thanks to instant respawns, mostly generous checkpointing, and most importantly, open ended combat encounters that offer multiple methods of approach. Make room at the table, Raiden, there’s a new sword-wielding cyberninja badass in town. dir=""ltr""  Taking place in a cyberpunk-themed post apocalypse, Ghostrunner tells the story of a cybernetically enhanced swordsmen who awakens after getting thrown out of a tower with little memory of what happened to him, who he is, or why he feels compelled to immediately plunge a sword into the poor soul waiting below him. Guided by the disembodied voice of an old man known as The Architect, the Ghostrunner gets wrapped up in an ongoing power struggle between the supposed rulers of this broken world, the efforts of a dying resistance, and the mystery of who he is. It’s a predictable tale, but the story is nonetheless well told and respectably voice acted. What’s especially great though is how the storytelling almost never slows down the fast pace of this six to eight hour campaign. There’s a lot of well acted dialogue in Ghostrunner, but it all plays out via conversations that happen in the head of the main character. That gives you the choice to either stop and listen intently to what’s being said, or to just push on through the various parkour heavy platforming challenges that typically accompany any long exposition dumps.  Of course, the action is what you’re really here for – and if you’ve got a thing for lightning quick, reflex intensive, high risk/high reward combat that gets decided with just a single strike, then Ghostrunner was made just for you. The only main weapon in Ghostrunner is a sword, though your speed and mobility options are weapons unto themselves. The Ghostrunner can run along walls, slide down slopes with great speed, and also utilize a quick dash that can be held down to slow down time and alter the direction of his momentum in mid-air. Chaining all of these abilities together created a wonderful flow of movement that allowed me to nearly effortlessly close the distance between me and the more basic enemies before satisfyingly slicing them in half. Those basic enemies aren’t your only foes for long though, and one of the best things about Ghostrunner is how your adversaries always rise to meet your growing skills and abilities. Just when I got comfortable dodging and deflecting the bullets of the single-shot pistol wielding enemies, I had to deal with machine gun wielding soldiers that forced me to keep moving if I wanted to survive long enough to be able to hit them while they were reloading. After I got used to dealing with those, then I had to learn how to deal with shielded enemies that could only be hit from behind. dir=""ltr""  Best of all is the amount of flexibility each combat scenario offers. There’s often multiple entry points to any given encounter that each come with their own challenges. You might take the right side and have to deal with a machine gun enemy and a long path before you can get to him. Or you could take the left path, take down a ninja guarding a shuriken powerup, and then grind on a rail sniping enemies as you go. I felt like I was always rewarded for checking out different routes whenever I hit a wall.  While it’s platforming portions are much more linear, they still benefit from a ton of variety in their challenges. Sometimes you’ll have to hack something to freeze it in place while you navigate through or around it, other times you’ll have to quickly throw shurikens at power plates to open a door and dash through it before it closes, and you’ll often find yourself using dash in creative ways in order to get through tricky obstacles. The deep well of ideas Ghostrunner uses to power its short campaign is not quite Titanfall 2 levels, but it’s extremely deep nonetheless. However, sometimes these ideas do overreach a bit and don’t quite fit with Ghostrunner’s controls. One section, for example, has you collecting 13 items scattered all around a constantly rotating object. It’s an awkward area with physics that feel off and frustrating mantling issues that send you flying towards your death when all you meant to do was pull yourself up to a ledge. Ghostrunner also uses an interesting, albeit slightly gimmicky, upgrade system that allows you to alter and enhance your abilities. You earn upgrades automatically as you progress, which take the form of tetris-like blocks that can be rotated and placed onto a grid. Space is limited, and the better upgrades take much more of the grid, so you’ll have to pick and choose which upgrades you want to have active at any time. The upgrades themselves are pretty good, and I found myself largely keeping space reserved for deflection-based options since I loved being able to bounce bullets back at enemies. That said, I found myself not really caring about rearranging puzzle pieces in order to try and find an “optimal” placement, especially since any unused spaces on the grid will speed up your regeneration of a resource called focus. Focus can be used to power one of your four special moves that each sort of function as a limited and situationally dependent ace in the hole. Blink, for example, can cut straight through shielded and otherwise tough to bring down enemies with one strike and keep your momentum going; Tempest, on the other hand, can be used to reflect projectiles that are otherwise extremely tough to avoid; and Surge is an anime-style sword energy slash that can take out multiple enemies from a distance. The last special move is a bit of a spoiler, but also has its own situational advantages. It’s also impressive that Ghostrunner’s sights and sounds are no slouch either. This is a gorgeous looking game with an equally excellent synthwave-inspired soundtrack that will keep your head bumping all throughout. With its breakneck pace and skill-heavy gameplay, Ghostrunner is a speedrunner’s dream. But even beyond that demographic, this is a great first person action game that feels punishing but fair. You may die hundreds of times, but instantaneous respawns and generous checkpointing ensure that Ghostrunner’s challenging combat and platforming never become a chore. More than all of that though, Ghostrunner is jam packed with a great variety of enemies, mechanics, and special powers that constantly changed up how I approached its many unique encounters. That meant it always felt fresh, and by the end of its six to eight hour campaign, I was all too eager to jump back in for seconds. "
309,Second Extinction Early Access ,7.0,"Historically, splicing dino-DNA with different species has gone terribly for everyone involved, but in this case merging it with the frantic intensity of Left 4 Dead’s co-op and setting it on a vast, open world-style map has worked out nicely thus far. Second Extinction, by Generation Zero creators Systemic Reaction, is a simple concept that I might’ve doodled on my homework in junior high school, but it relies on the speed and polish of its action and the variety of its mutant enemies to stand out. For a co-op focused shooter that just hit Early Access with a planned several months of runway left before full launch, it’s off to a strong start. The premise here is that mutated dinosaurs are taking over the planet and it’s somehow up to you and up to two friends to massacre them and “reclaim Earth” before it’s too late. That’s about it; there isn’t much of an overarching plot here in the sense of overt exposition. Instead, the evolution of the world is the story, conveyed by way of a more organic and emergent format with its singular big, connected world map.  When you choose a mission you also choose a drop point that determines where you start – though at the moment, that always means “icy tundra.” Once you’ve arrived you’re free to explore and do whatever you want – including optional side objectives or even going into neighboring zones in search of higher-value targets or to pursue a distant optional mission. It’s typically up to you to decide if you want to go after better rewards in more dangerous areas or play it safe and progress more slowly. Usually co-op shooters of the Left 4 Dead ilk feature smaller maps and tight corridors, so the freedom here is refreshing. Dinos make their presence felt in more unique ways, like tunneling out of the ground behind you in a cave or chasing you in a pack towards a dead end. Getting surrounded is terrifying and overwhelming, and the dynamic spawning makes each run extremely unpredictable. There are some hot spots in each zone that usually have certain types of enemies, but it’s hard to ever feel safe and secure no matter which direction you decide to go which keeps you on your toes. dir=""ltr""  On top of that, dinosaurs react to the movements and areas of focus of all players globally. So if the community is, collectively, attacking certain zones more than others to farm specific upgrade resources or to go after difficult Contracts, threat levels will shift during the weekly reset and larger-scale Emergence Events may start to show up in some regions. The magic of this system is that it creates a satisfying dynamic that helps ensure missions are never identical.  So far in my quest to reclaim Earth I’ve killed a lot of dinosaurs. Like, a lot of dinosaurs. Second Extinction takes its name very seriously because after a day or two your individual kill count feels large enough that you may have been capable of wiping out an entire species on your own. This is a very good thing, though, because slaughtering scores of grotesque, genetically modified beasties here is extremely rewarding, at least in the first 15 or so hours I’ve spent with it so far. Weapons are fun across the board, even if they’re standard fare and lack some impact at first. Once you start upgrading them and unlocking key guns, like the SMG as a secondary weapon, it all starts to click. I fell in love with the grenade launcher, personally, and after a few missions’ worth of saving up the upgrade currency I was able to unlock the ability to have it explode on impact with an enemy, instead of waiting for the fuse to detonate. That was a literal game-changer. Unlike packs of zombies, which are usually all roughly the same size and shape with a few rare special ones thrown in, there is a surprising amount of consistent enemy variation with dinosaurs. You’ve got the small, agile raptors that dart around and chase you down at breakneck speed, and even the spitters that can hit you with acid from a distance. Large, tankier dinos show up to soak up bullets during some fights and then the really big ones, like the ferocious T-Rex, even make an appearance in the more dangerous regions. Having this constant enemy variety makes an already tense battlefield completely chaotic as you find yourself sliding under a Rex or tossing incendiary grenades at groups of smaller raptors. Pivoting around and circling the big creatures feels almost like a dance at times since you can dash backwards and side-to-side for increased mobility. Speaking of, battling the T-Rex is an immensely satisfying fight. Each of the dinos have glowing weak points, and Rex's glow is just under his chin at the throat. This is difficult to hit with my trusty grenade launcher that’s so effective against lower to the ground enemies thanks to its blast radius, so I'd usually switch to an automatic weapon for sustained damage or get up close with a shotgun before dashing out of the way. Lots of kiting while chipping away at its health from a distance is crucial. Playing by yourself is technically possible, but it’s just not as fun and has some serious difficulty spikes when the big groups of dinos arrive. In co-op, taking a balanced loadout between the three of you is key, and as with all games of this type it’s far better with a group of friends than with randomly matched strangers. For example, making sure someone has rechargeable ammo drop kits or grenade drop kits keeps you stocked up and big AoE attacks like incendiary grenades or air strikes can really thin the herd in a pinch. Every mission ends with a climactic last-stand battle in which you must secure and defend the landing zone for an escort ship. In the more hostile zones it’s easy to get overwhelmed quickly here, but scraping it out and surviving by the skin of your teeth is just as good as it was back in the heyday of Left 4 Dead. dir=""ltr""  When you combine that with the instability of the world and how dramatically things can shift across the map, there is enough variety in enemies and gear to keep things interesting for the 15 hours it took me to see all the missions and feel like I had my fill of what’s available right now, even though there are still lots of upgrade options I haven’t explored yet. But I’d be lying if I said after spending that long with this shooting frenzy I wasn’t starting to grow a bit tired of the arctic tundra that dominates the map. Snow and ice is a great contrast to the oranges of fire attacks and the redness of bloody gore, but it lacks variety. I’d love a more jungle-style area or even something on the edge of a volcano to shake things up, and there is a ton of room for getting a little crazier with things. Despite the one-note setting, the objectives and missions are more diverse than you usually see in a co-op shooter. One mission may have you triggering missiles and searching for waypoints while fighting through hordes of dinosaurs, while others may send you to escort payloads into a mine. And while you’re doing your primary mission, tons of optional side objectives always crop up, like shooting down recon drones or destroying breeding caves full of eggs. You can complete these for extra Resource tokens, which are used for upgrading guns with things like improved stats or even new features such as the aforementioned grenades exploding on contact. The upgrade points come frequently enough to feel like you’re making progress, but are just rare enough that it’s actually enticing to consider doing extra missions when out on a job. On top of that, you eventually unlock extra Contracts that you can accept during missions. These have hyper-specific challenges on them like getting a certain number of headshots with a particular weapon. It’s nice to have more goals to check off, but it’s mostly meaningless. Before a match you’ll pick a character, each of which equips a primary gun, secondary gun, and their own unique perks and signatures abilities. There’s Ortega, who can equip two primary weapons and forgo the secondary weapon, meaning she can bring both a shotgun and assault rifle into combat if you want. She also gets to dash at increased speeds which is excellent for evading damage. Rosy, on the other hand, can lay down static pylons that create electrical barriers between them used for stunning dinos. There are two more hunters as of now to choose from, and in addition to gameplay differences all four have unique personalities and voices – they’re not overly memorable or anything, but it’s still better than picking generic classes or just choosing abilities outright. What’s missing right now, most of all, are the long-term hooks – that layer of progression that Left 4 Dead never had but has been added on top of nearly every game in the genre it spawned in the decade since. I’d have liked more things to unlock beyond just gun upgrades and new weapons. Things like character and gun skins would help incentivize me to return, and something like a Battle Pass would be useful to reward sticking with this game instead of the million other options out there. As far as Early Access games go, Second Extinction is in excellent shape. For all intents and purposes, it feels very close to being finished already: the foundational gunplay involved in blasting hundreds of mutant dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes is already strong, each playable character feels different, there is a good short-term progression system, and there’s a clear format worth expanding upon. If the developers spare no expense on adding longevity and rewarding time spent with more depth and map variety, they’re going to make a fortune with this place. "
310,Partisans 1941 ,6.0,"Trudging through the mud, with nothing but a Luger and their own courage, three resistance fighters get ready to ambush the enemy soldiers. Those soldiers kidnapped a doctor who is essential for the success of this mission. The soldiers scream in confusion while one gets his throat cut while a second catches a bullet with his head. It just takes a couple of seconds, but that is enough for an enemy to flank the resistance fighters which ends up being fatal for the team. Partisans 1941 is a real-time tactics game which is best compared to Commando’s or the more recent Desperados III. The scene I told before is one of the many challenges and confrontations between Russian resistance fighters and German Nazi’s. The setting is the Eastern front which is basically the start of WWII and one of the many situations you as a player will not be able to win at first.  Every mission will give the player control over a total of four characters. These partisans could be young, very young. Sometimes the partisan you’re using is just fourteen years old. With these characters you will try to eliminate the enemy soldiers by any means necessary. You might silently cut their throats, poison their drinks, reverse their trucks of simply shoot them in a direct confrontation. The choice of freedom - although stealth is incentivized - results in Partisans supporting different styles of fighting. The first couple of missions will take you through all these possibilities. Players will get to know the different specialisms each character has and these specialisms are powered up by gaining levels. Zorin is the type of character that will kill their enemies using knives while Fetisov and Trofim are optimized by using heavy artillery. With each mission you have to decide which characters to bring with you. I tried to sneak during all of my missions in occupied Russia. Some characters have grown to be my favorites but I felt forced by this strategy because one simple mistake could mean the end for the entire team. This is what makes Partisans exciting since you will try to think of the best approach for every mission. At the same time this forced me to abuse the quickload-button. Partisans might remind you of Shadow Tactics: Blades or Shogun. The big difference between those games and Partisans is the fact that the game reminds you about the quicksave option often and that is exactly what you want to do with Partisans, play from quicksave to the next quicksave. Enemy soldiers seem to make random patrols and their vision seems unending. It seems impossible to finish a mission without being spotted by one of them. This gives the missions a feeling of a difficult puzzle which I liked, but in reality it is nothing more than ordinary trial and error. It seems unavoidable to not get into an open battle so it is vital to pick the right team for the right job. Characters might specialize in the use of pistols while the other prefers shotguns and all of them have different statistics like perfect distance to shoot at and the penalty you get for not being in the right spot. So to be in the perfect position before pulling the trigger. It is pretty hard to get the perfect fight started and it might escalate before you pull it off. Luckily there is an “emergency button” which will slow down time and makes it possible to order your troops simultainously. This seems to be ideal, but a button that pauses the game entirely would be a better option. The positive about these fights is that they are very entertaining. It feels like you are in a War Movie with bullets flying left and right that might hit you or the enemy. If you play on the normal difficulty it seems that your bullets hit the enemy more often compared to the shots they fire. That means that it is possible to win fights you should not. At some point in the game your characters will be so strong that a head-on approach might be the best. This might be your cup of coffee but due to this the last levels felt quite anti-climactic to me. That feeling resonates through the entire game. Missions are alternated by walking around a camp, build tents that will store your provisions and this is quite boring and unnecessary since you will find these materials during your missions as well. During your time in an encampment you will learn about the lore through conversations between your Partisans but this lacks impact. The choices you make during the missions itself are why you would play this game and they are exciting and entertaining. All those other moments are just a diversion. The missions in Partisans 1941 are on a small scale with small levels and a raw appearance that reflect the time of war. Villagers are exasperated, all roads are muddy and the tracks are visible while artillery and provision are full of nazi propaganda. The ambiance is very well done although there are some visual bugs. The worst one was the shadows flickering and that was not prevented by putting them on the lowest graphic setting. These small visual bugs are not a big problem, but gameplay bugs are. I regularly found stuttering skills, like the Fan Fire of Belozerova. When I activated the skill, the character got stuck in an animation which followed in it being seen by enemies. Daedalic fixes some of these issues by hotfixing them, but not all of them got fixed immediately. I’m looking forward to the fixes to all the other problems because the bugs forced me to reload my games more often than I would have liked. But I think that some of these problems are beyond repairable. This goes for some of the character models and the inventory screen is unoptimized to say the least. The same could be said about the User Interface. This is done pretty simply, but it is hard to get the needed information you’re looking for. It is hard to find the right information or compare weapons. Some tooltips just did not appear which seem to be worse in the final version compared to the preview version. Partisans 1941 has everything that would make it a great real-time tactics game, but has some rough edges. The game shines with a combination of stealth and action that is switches up with great battles in a sorrowful WWII setting. But gameplay and visual bugs combined with a sauce that tastes like nothing makes it that this game failed in delivering the great feeling I wanted to experience. The game has some great ideas, but lacks in execution. "
311,mothered: Broken Porcelain ,4.0,"As a follow-up to 2018’s enjoyable stealth-based survival horror game Remothered: Tormented Fathers, Remothered: Broken Porcelain is both a sequel and a prequel – but that’s really just a polite way of saying I couldn’t make heads or tails of the chronology of its plot, and I’m not convinced its creators could either. Perhaps I was too distracted by its countless audio dropouts, freezes, broken controller inputs and baffling enemy behaviours to really be able to concentrate on straightening out the tangled threads of its nonlinear narrative. If nothing else, Remothered: Broken Porcelain is aptly named; like a shattered vase it lacks structure, each individual part is rough around the edges, and it’s not really worth the effort to try and piece them all together. At the very least the setting is an appropriately haunting one. Ashmann Inn is an antiquated hotel situated in a secluded snowy mountain region highly reminiscent of Stephen King’s The Shining. Certainly during its opening moments I enjoyed the eerie ambience of its dimly lit hallways as I, controlling the young protagonist Jennifer, indulged in a deadly game of hide and seek with the murderous, mind-controlled hotel maid Andrea (seemingly modelled on Annie from Stephen King’s Misery).   But that enjoyment was about as short-lived as Stephen King’s career as a film director, because Remothered: Broken Porcelain simply can’t sustain the same level of cat and mouse tension that the original game could. This is largely due to Jennifer’s movement speed which is positively glacial in comparison to the swift gait of each enemy stalker. By the time you’ve slowly crouch-walked your way up behind one, they’ve already read a book, made a sandwich, and turned around and spotted you before the stealth attack prompt has managed to materialise over their head. Since attacking enemies from behind is your sole combat option for the most part, once detected your only course of action is to flee and hide until they’re no longer on high alert. This can also be problematic, as seen by the many times I went to hop into a locker and the ‘open locker’ button prompt failed to appear, resulting in me frantically shuffling back and forth trying to find it before copping the wrong end of a pair of sewing scissors in the jugular. The supernatural sensitivity of the enemy AI versus your own sluggishness and unreliable inputs doesn’t make for a fun stealth experience, just a frustrating one that made each area of Remothered: Broken Porcelain a chore to complete. Outside of these cumbersome enemy encounters, there’s surprisingly little else to do in Remothered: Broken Porcelain. There are significantly fewer environmental puzzles to solve than there were in Tormented Fathers, with only the occasional cracking of a safe combination to demand much in the way of lateral thought. Instead, Remothered: Broken Porcelain places an emphasis on Jennifer’s ability to temporarily teleport her consciousness into a moth and fly up to out of reach items or, in one instance, agitate a guard dog enough for Jennifer to slip by. It’s an interesting concept, but there’s no real scope for employing it outside of very specific story junctures, and when you do get to use it it’s like trying to pilot a remote-controlled drone through a room submerged in honey. The moth’s movements are seriously listless and it has a tendency to get stuck on parts of the environment. And since it can only be used in short bursts I’d often find myself switching to moth form, getting stuck in a wall on the way to my target, being beamed back to Jennifer, and then forced to wait for a cooldown timer to recharge before I could start the process over again. dir=""ltr""    However, while fixing technical issues is of course appreciated, it’s going to take nothing less than a significant overhaul to smooth out Remothered: Broken Porcelain’s garbled story. The plot jarringly shunts forwards and backwards in time while being only loosely connected by cutscenes that end far too abruptly. The only shining light as far as the story is concerned are the handful of playable flashbacks that centre around Jennifer and her best friend Linn. They’re easily the most well-written exchanges in the entire ordeal and are set prior to the madness descending on the residents of Ashmann Inn, meaning they’re mercifully devoid of any sloppy combat sections. Remothered: Broken Porcelain feels so incomplete that I'm surprised I managed to complete it at all. While Ashmann Inn is rich with suitably menacing horror movie-inspired interiors to explore, the actual encounters with its inhabitants are frustratingly clumsy and Jennifer’s moth ability is a poor substitute for the more cerebral puzzle-solving of 2018's Tormented Fathers. Add in a slipshod story structure and a raft of technical issues, and Remothered: Broken Porcelain is ultimately a hugely disappointing sequel. "
312,Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition ,6.0,"Age of Empires 3 is the weirdest of the old-school RTS series – a game that, back in 2005, radically departed from the others for a different feel. Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition gives it new life, changing some things that begged to be changed and bringing the production values up to a much higher standard. It's the Age of Empires update that will be least appreciated, but most needed, a remaster that adds new single-player missions and civilizations. It gives AoE 3's unique twists on the RTS a new life. It also serves as a pretty sharp reminder that this is the most obtuse game in the series, because most of its clever tricks aren't half as good as it thinks they are. Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition edition upgrades graphics, colors, and textures across the board, all the way up to 4K resolutions. The remade Home City screens are characterful renditions of cities from Amsterdam to Tenochtitlan, with stops in Beijing and Berlin along the way. It ran pretty well on my AMD 8350 and GeForce GTX 1070 Ti, with occasional hitching on eight-player matches and a handful of isolated crashes. A surprising bonus is how the remastered soundtrack vastly improves the music, with richer bass filling out the horns and strings. In fact, after a few hours I realized that the Age of Empires 3 take on the main theme absolutely slaps. It's my new favorite from the series soundtracks.  The other sound effects and voice acting are improved but not up to the level you’d expect from any given modern game. There are two notable exceptions to that: A pre-Mass Effect fame Jennifer Hale as Lizzie in the campaign, and the redone or entirely new voice acting in campaign and historical scenarios. (Everyone other than whoever did Gustavus Adolphus. All due respect to the greatest of the Swedes, but he’s horrible.) Underneath that updated exterior, Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition remains as hardcore an economy-focused RTS as the others in the series. To be competitive in multiplayer you have to micromanage and and flawlessly execute economic plans, tasking and re-tasking your settlers to hunt game, chop trees, and mine silver with maximum efficiency. (There's no Stone in AoE 3.) There’s a lot of plates to keep spinning as you build a sprawling base to take over the map, including fortifications like walls and guard towers, all while carefully timing big spends of resources to advance from one age to the next, unlocking new technologies, buildings, and units as you go. Age of Empires 3's early modern setting means there's a lot more ranged combat than other Age games since guns are around from the jump. You still have the standard Melee/Ranged, Infantry/Cavalry, and Light/Heavy distinctions, but there are more complex unit types like skirmishers or stealthy ambushers, not to mention hero units in the mix as well. Plus the impact of mobile, area-of-effect field artillery really changes fights, requiring specific counter-units to take down. Castles and towers are less numerous, but those that do exist are more powerful: Fortresses bristle with guns and cannons. dir=""ltr""  The biggest twist in Age of Empires 3 is that your base doesn’t stand alone, but serves as a colony of some distant nation. A system of Home City Cards allows you to bring in shipments of troops, new technologies, and resources as you defeat enemy units and gain experience. You get to choose which 25 cards you have available by making decks before matches start. (Thankfully, the old Home City levelling system has changed. You have every card available to you at the start—no more getting stomped just because someone else has unlocked the good cards. Levelling up your home city is only for cosmetics now.) Carefully timing your shipments allows you to coordinate and pull off weird strategies that aren't feasible in other Age games' tight economic constraints. You can access unique units you'd not be able to otherwise build, get booms of resources out of nowhere, and place down powerful buildings like factories and forts using cards. The cards combine with the resource-gathering primary economy in a neat way, letting you plan your build order ahead of time. It's a unique implementation of two different RTS economies in one—something no game has really done since. It's extremely cool in theory. It's extremely confusing in practice. Figuring out how to competitively use so many of the units, even basic units like cavalry Hussars, is a balance of upgrades in the tech tree against upgrades from the Home City Cards. It's just far too difficult to parse the strategies available for each civilization, let alone devise new ones, as you sort through the pile of possible cards while referencing each nation's tech tree. The only solution is pouring in hundreds of hours to find out if you enjoy the weird ""real game"" behind Age of Empires 3's multiplayer. Series and genre dabblers will probably be better suited with the more conventional Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition, but the twists on the core Age formula are too compelling for RTS addicts to pass up. The ins and outs of more complex Age tactics are explained in a series of excellent Art of War tutorials that double as challenge missions for your micromanagement skills. You might have seen similar ones in Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition, and the idea is refined for AoE 3 DE. The marquee event of the Age of Empires series is Skirmish and Multiplayer fights, and AoE3 DE is no different. Battles are all about play and counter-play between the units: Spears take down cavalry, cavalry charges wipe out muskets, and muskets shoot spears. Nothing about that core gameplay has truly changed in the Definitive Edition: the unit movements and pathfinding feel just as jerky and physics-defying as I remember them, for better and for worse. Boats especially still slip, spin, and slide around like soap in a bathtub rather than huge sailing ships. There are a bare handful of minor gameplay changes in AoE3: DE, and a ton of balance changes, but nothing too radical. The AI is notably improved, but it's still prone to doing stuff like marching unarmed villagers right into your army or base. At its highest levels, however, I was surprised at the challenge. The original had nothing like it. dir=""ltr""  As for story missions, there’s a ton of content here, including over 60 single-player missions across three campaigns and a handful of newly added historical scenarios. They’re generally all fun but forgettable classic RTS missions that hand you a scenario and give you some objectives, not really ever reaching past that. Even for its time, it didn’t innovate in its campaign design. The main story is as goofy as ever, a bland pseudo-historical thriller involving the Holy Grail, the Fountain of Youth, a magical bloodline, some stuff that was probably blatantly stolen from The Da Vinci Code, and more historical errors and outright historical fiction than you can shake an arquebus at. There are also some absurd moments of pointedly ignoring the real-world horrors that happened during colonization and contact between cultures, and students of history today aren't going to react very well to that. Major changes have been made to the Native American-themed WarChiefs expansion campaign, and the story has a bit more pathos than it used to as a result. The Asian Dynasties expansion campaigns try harder, and the Indian campaign is interesting, but the Chinese campaign in particular is pure fantasy. The campaigns are a fun enough way to spend some time, 30 to 40 hours depending on difficulty setting, but still aren't exactly compelling. It's doubly frustrating because there was potential for a great historical campaign here. That's a decision long past criticism, but the remaster does address some of the worst historical mistakes. On first start, a message from the developers talks about fixes that center around the Lakota and Haudenosaunee civilizations, and to a lesser extent the Aztecs, correcting names, adding their real language and more authentic artwork, as well as removing historical inaccuracies (such as mining by the two North American nations). The in-game note does call this kind of mistake-fixing a ""process,"" and removing everything historically wrong from a game the size of AoE 3 surely isn't feasible in a mere remaster, but that said, there are some glaring examples that I’d have liked to have seen cleaned up. The Asian civilizations are still led by ""Monk"" heros who have confusingly out of place mystical powers. The new Incan faction speaks a language that sounds a lot like proper Quechua, but the Aztecs speak the same gibberish they spoke 14 years ago—it certainly doesn't sound like Nahuatl. The saving grace in this are the new Historical Battles, which cram some of the best gameplay ideas of the last 15 years into the Age of Empires 3 mold. They're based on proper historical events, and include some truly choice, weird, deep cuts from the battles of the early modern era. Here's an example: My favorite was a MOBA-like battle in east Africa based on an ill-fated yet heroic attempt by Portugese warriors to help the Ethiopian emperor fight off the Somalian Adal Sultanate. If there were more like this I’d have been much more enthusiastic about this Definitive Edition, but they end up as more of a taste of what might have been. (For the lone Age of Empires 3 fanatic that gasped and cheered at the mention of Africa: I see you. No, there's not more than that. I'm sorry—but someone is sure to take the unit models and use them for a mod.) dir=""ltr""  All of that said, it's inevitable that this Definitive Edition won't age as well as the others in the series. Sprites tend to look good forever, but the character models in Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition barely reach a par with Company of Heroes 2, released some seven years ago now. (Some, I swear, are worse: The model for the panda bear is truly awful. It's like a painted balloon.) The destruction physics and environmental effects are improved, no doubt, and cannonballs still send soldiers flying. It just can't compete with a scratch-built modern engine—like this year's Iron Harvest. The old interface is nigh-unplayable compared to a modern RTS, but the new one both works and comes in three versions. The UI overhaul probably does the most to bring Age of Empires 3 up to modern standards, floating on top of things rather than obscuring half the action. It's nothing fancy, but it works… and it includes some egregiously awful color choices. Brilliant pure yellow and white text on a faux-wood brown background is the biggest and most consistent offender. It's eye strain-inducing. However, accessibility features are here to save the day: You can simply remap all identifying player and text colors to any other color. I'm glad someone was paying attention to StarCraft 2's way of doing things. Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition is a bold attempt to remaster the most controversial game in a series. The funky experimental RTS at the core of AoE 3 is intact, but it's still just that: Weird. Like a stinky cheese, it just can't appeal to everyone. The new graphics, UI, sound, and content make it much more fun to play and will win converts among those who are trying it for the first time. The rest was harder to update, and though it's better than it was, the single-player scenarios will never be half as fun as multiplayer matches. "
313,Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit ,7.0,"There are moments in some games that instantly bring a smile to my face, transporting me back to my childhood while the rest of the world melts into the background. That’s what taking control of Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit’s augmented reality RC kart for the first time felt like. The joy of driving around my living space from a worm’s-eye view while familiar Mario characters zoom by and Koopa Shells fly across the screen is refreshingly different – at least when everything is running smoothly. All too often, frustrating technical limitations can throw a banana peel into the works. Mario Kart Live is a wild hybrid mix of a traditional Mario Kart video game and a physical, remote-controlled toy. You use your Switch to control an actual RC car around tracks you set up in your own home, viewing the action through the car’s camera. Each course is made by placing the four included cardboard gates (no more, no less) which the camera on the car reads as you go through each one in order, but any additional loops and turns you take along the way are entirely up to you. An augmented version of that camera feed is displayed on the Switch itself, overlaying 3D item boxes, opposing AI racers, and all the other things you might expect from a regular Mario Kart game. It’s incredibly novel, though not always as smooth as that sounds.  Setting up Mario Kart Live for the first time is a delightfully simple process. All you have to do is point the kart’s camera toward a QR code on your screen, spend some time learning its controls, and set up the cardboard gates. This tutorial phase takes just a few moments, but I found myself taking my time with each step – not because I needed more driving practice, but because it was so freaking cool to zip Mario around my living room, through my kitchen, and under my sofa as my cat playfully followed this strange new device. It’s genuinely magical even before you set up your first real course. Bringing a race track to life requires an ample amount of space and has some restrictions in order to maintain a good connection. Nintendo recommends a room of 15 x 15 max and 10 x 12 for 150 CC speed with the kart never going more than five meters away from your Switch. The console and kart are connected through Wi-Fi, so if you have slow internet speeds you could run into problems. dir=""ltr""  That said, most of the connection issues I had were limited to being too far from the Switch – or one time from having the course gates separated by walls, which Nintendo does not recommend doing for this very reason. Occasionally the framerate could drop while at long distances, and I had a few anomalies where the on-screen gameplay would halt and then skip ahead to where the real-life kart actually was. These issues weren’t common enough to be a major concern, but when they did happen it served as a harsh reminder of the practical limitations of this otherwise impressive technology.  I’m fortunate enough to have a pretty spacious communal area in my apartment which gave me a lot of options for setting up different tracks. When pushing Mario Kart Live to its absolute limits, I was able to create a course that was 112 feet long – though some frame drops did occur since I had it weaving around my open living room and kitchen space as well as the adjacent hallway. My favorite course was 80 feet long and had a figure-eight design that went from the living room to the kitchen, looped around the island, went behind the sofa, and finally cut behind the couch to close the loop. It was fun to drive, though it wasn’t just the layout that left me beaming but all the extras I decorated it with. I made it a Halloween-themed course with pumpkins, ghosts, candy, and plastic cups meaningfully placed throughout for a manageably chaotic challenge. And when combined with all the in-game magic of Rainbow Road-style ring boosts and Piranha plant infested gates it was a thrill to drive through. dir=""ltr""  On the opposite end of the spectrum was the track I made in my admittedly large but extremely crowded with furniture bedroom. In contrast to the more spacious living room, there was only a small perimeter around the two desks in this room where a track could fit. This 36-foot track did work, but it also left zero options for course variation and additional real-life obstacles. If I was stuck with only this smaller space for where I could play, I don’t imagine I would enjoy Mario Kart Live much at all. My fondest memories playing were only possible when I had enough room to embrace Nintendo and developer Velan Studios’ invitation to get creative. The gameplay systems they built into the digital part of Mario Kart Live met my own imagination halfway, and this collaboration turned otherwise simple courses into something I loved making and racing on as an adult – and would’ve absolutely adored as a kid.  While course design played a crucial role in the fun I had with Mario Kart Live, it would be doing it a disservice to say my enjoyment was limited to that process alone. Unlike Nintendo’s cardboard Labo kits, the fun isn’t primarily bound to the process of building – instead, it begins with it. Course building is a labor of love and the fruits of that labor are cool custom tracks you then get to race on. But keep in mind that I failed at making fun courses a lot before making one I wanted to drive again and again. I made the turns too tight to take; I left fabric on the floor that was hard to avoid and even harder to back out of; I made course loops that were too hard for the kart’s camera to read, causing my laps not to register at all; I put too many real world items on the course, or I didn’t put enough. While there’s some helpful info in the menus, Mario Kart Live offers little guidance in creating courses or considering the real-world issues players may run into. I didn’t mind troubleshooting this on my own, and I imagine inundating players with too many hand-holding guidelines would be off-putting in its own way, but being left to figure it out for yourself can be frustrating at times – especially when Nintendo proved it can do creativity-based level design tutorials so well in Super Mario Maker 2. dir=""ltr""  Once your designs are complete, beating your digital AI opponents isn’t too hard on its own. It can be trickier when you’ve made a course that gives you a proper challenge, but it doesn’t feel great to put yourself at an intentional disadvantage just to make things interesting – even if it’s more about having fun than winning, who doesn’t want to win? This is where local multiplayer might shine, but Nintendo only provided one kart for this review so I didn’t have a chance to try PvP out as there’s no online play. At $100 per kart and the need for player two (and potentially three and four) to have their own Nintendo Switch, that makes playing multiplayer a huge investment.  Those who have pets may be anxious to see how their furry friends respond to Mario racing around the room. Just like people, animals aren’t all the same, but I thought I’d share my experience with how my cat Bruce reacted. Bruce is a typical cat in the sense that she’s rarely interested by pet toys, but often very interested in stuff that isn’t for her. Mario Kart Live is no exception. She followed the kart around the entire time when I first started because she loves chasing things, especially when it seems like they are moving around on their own. It was initially common for her to step onto the course, but over time the novelty wore off and she’d chill on the sofa as I zoomed around the living room. Bruce is pretty well behaved (she doesn’t knock things over for fun, for example) so any fallen cups or knocked over items were my own doing. I actually enjoyed having her appear as an obstacle to avoid too. I love my cat and seeing her appear in-game was an amusement that never faded. But don’t worry: no pets were harmed in the making of this review. Lastly, I did consider moving her to my bedroom while I drove, but since I raced in the same room as her litter box that’s a risky decision. This is something to keep in mind for your pets as well. Where is their food/water? Where is their litter box? Where are their toys? My cat could handle my encroachment on her space but your pet may have different needs.  Following in the footsteps of past Mario Kart games, Mario Kart Live has 8 different cups to complete. Like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, all cups are unlocked from the beginning, which makes sense when every course is designed by you to begin with. You can even use the same setup for every grand prix, but each cup and course still manages to have a distinct flavor and style determined by the different weather conditions, gate types, and iconic songs that are added in-game. Tracks like World 1-1 were bizarre futuristic nostalgia trips littered with 8-bit Goomba obstacles that I welcomed with open arms (and often with my front wheels). And Magikoopa Mirage stands out as an absolute favorite with Kamek swooping down to turn everything into Mirror Mode. It was wonderfully disorienting to drive through a reflection of my own home, and clever gimmicks like this helped make a single room feel far more varied. dir=""ltr""  However, other track concepts fell short. For example, Freezie Frost is littered with so many Freezies they felt more like an inevitable halt to the action rather than a thrilling thing to dodge. The wind-based courses were bittersweet as well – while I loved the added challenge of being pushed left or right along the track, and found it technologically impressive, it kind of sucked to be potentially thrown into real-world objects when my AI opponents never ran that same crash risk. Attempts to bring back old favorites like Rainbow Road also felt limited by the mixed reality setting. The iconic (and often deadly) boosts were scattered throughout, but it’s hard to imagine something that could capture the sweat-inducing leaps, impossibly tight turns, and glitzy presentation I’ve come to associate with every past iteration of the course.  The RC kart itself controls incredibly well. It’s not quite a one-to-one with the smoothness of traditional Mario Kart games (to be fair, it actually has to obey the laws of physics), but it’s easy to forget this is a real, physical kart when zooming through a level while looking at your screen. The fact that you can execute the iconic Mario Kart drift is a pleasant surprise, a clever trick made possible by having your on-screen kart be a digital representation of the physical one. The strength of your boost is even determined by the amount of time you drift as usual, but complex courses crammed into a smaller living space could mean a big boost of speed can easily backfire. I often found it easier to skip drifting, while normally I’d be looking for every opportunity to do it. Since Mario Kart Live doesn’t come with a real, living Lakitu to pick you up when you spin out (what a shame), avoiding crashes is usually more beneficial than going as fast as possible. I admit, it’s a bit disappointing to lose that part of Mario Kart’s usual depth, but it didn’t stop me from having fun and feeling challenged on a properly built track. dir=""ltr""  What Nintendo and Velan have accomplished here is impressive, though some power-ups don’t translate quite as well to an AR format. Throwing digital Koopa Shells and dropping banana peels behaves as you’d expect, but the Bullet Bill item automatically driving you along the course isn’t much help if it steers you straight into a furniture leg. Likewise, smart steering will automatically guide you along the center of the course but since it can’t account for physical objects this aid to novice players isn’t as useful as it initially sounds. In addition to those classic power-ups that make Mario Kart Live feel right at home among other entries in the franchise, new ones like P Switches have been drawn from other Mario sources. This addition in particular fits right in as a great way to let players rack up coins, which are used to increase speed on the course and unlock cosmetics between races. Earning trophies through grand prixs will give you new radio stations, gate types, and weather conditions to use when designing your own custom courses too. The faster 150 CC and 200 CC modes are also locked behind getting five and 10 cup trophies, respectively, which are the most enticing reward offered. They increase the speed of the physical kart itself, which unfortunately means they’re practicality is tethered to the space you have available. If you’re making a small course with tighter turns, you’ll need to knock it down to as low as 50 CC, but more spacious courses can take full advantage of the breakneck speeds. Time trial mode adds an additional competitive angle. It lets you play against your own ghost to try and beat your time, or pass your Switch or controller to a friend and challenge them to beat it instead. This can be a cool hack to create an element of multiplayer with only one kart, but it still wasn’t as interesting as just doing a grand prix against AI drivers. Plus, once you put the gates away for the day, it’s unlikely you’d be able to replicate the exact same course again.  The biggest drawback of Mario Kart Live in my experience has been the maintenance. I’ll admit that I don’t sweep or mop my floors enough, but between my hair, my roomates’ hair, and my cats’ hair, the kart’s wheels have quickly become visibly dirty and, more importantly, clogged by strands. dir=""ltr""  The kart is relatively small and weighs only half a pound. Only the front wheels pivot to let you steer, but after just a few hours of play turning became a real challenge. I had to remove the rubber tires and painstakingly pull the hair strands out with tweezers to get it to function smoothly again. But after this pitstop and a swift sweep of my apartment, I was back on the road (at least for a while). It’s hard to expect much better from a kart like this, but it is a notable drawback in terms of playing Mario Kart Live in real-world conditions. And as cool as it is to drive under the sofa, I’ve stopped doing it altogether to avoid the risk of any additional debris. As for battery life, the kart charges with a provided USB-C cable – the same kind that powers your Nintendo Switch console. The battery lasts a few hours and takes a good while to become fully charged when dead. But it’s a decent battery length even out of the box, and as long as I charged it between play sessions it didn’t impede my racing prospects.  There are some other limitations I ran into that are worth taking note of. For starters, the kart can’t handle elevation well, so you’re limited to driving on a flat floor. Nintendo claims it can be driven on carpet, and while I can’t test that out on my hardwood floor, I can confirm that moving from floor to rug is a no go (that may be due to the slightly elevated bump between them, but it didn’t work well regardless). Another small nuisance is the fact that you need to weigh down the cardboard gates – crashing into them can otherwise make them spin out and potentially render your course undrivable since it uses the gates as AR markers to keep track of the layout. If you don’t hit the gates you can get away with a lazier setup, but having done it a few times I can say I don’t recommend leaving them unweighted. dir=""ltr""  So while making courses is a blast, it’s also cumbersome and time-consuming. Whether or not needing to set up and tear down courses every time you play is a positive or negative will be entirely dependent on how much energy you’re willing to exert and how much of an inconvenience you find it to race behind your housemates’ ankles while they do dishes. Three-fourths of my housemates are gamers, and all four understand my job/interest in games, so it thankfully didn’t bother any of us. But this could easily be a point of frustration in some households, especially in a smaller space – and doubly so since Mario Kart Live can’t be played outside if don’t have Wi-Fi outdoors (and Nintendo doesn’t recommend it even if you do). Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit’s mixed reality novelty excels when you have the space and motivation to make your courses flourish, but occasional tech hiccups and clogged wheels are hazards just as dangerous as any Blue Shell. That said, when I took the time to really lean into the creative challenge building a track presented me with, I was often rewarded by having a blast racing on it. Some familiar mechanics get lost in the translation to AR, but this is still an enjoyable Mario Kart game no matter what roadway I made. "
314,Genshin Impact ,9.0,"Let's get this out of the way: Genshin Impact and its beautiful, expansive anime world of Teyvat clearly draw inspiration from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and I mean a whole heck of a lot. From the art style to the stamina-based ""climb anything"" mechanic to the gliding, it’s impossible not to be reminded of Link’s open-world adventures in Hyrule while exploring. But this isn't just some copycat, as Genshin Impact's fantastical world, wide array of diverse playable characters, and deep RPG systems are all unique and awesome enough to let it stand on its own two feet – and every one of the more than 120 hours I've spent in Teyvat has been an absolute blast. Genshin Impact is a free-to-play action-adventure RPG where you play a vague and mysterious “traveler” from another world who arrives in the land of Teyvat before being attacked by a sorceress or God or...something, and your twin is captured. After waking up on a beach at level one and with zero loot, you set off on a quest to find your lost sibling that involves a whole lot of picking fruit, crafting items, and fighting deities, but surprisingly little in the way of actually searching for your twin. Because, just like during Link's rush to save Zelda, completing these quests where you *checks notes* feed ducks is way more important.  Genshin Impact’s story is one of its weaker points, using just about every anime character trope and story cliche in the book. Characters will re-explain the same magical jargon like they’re getting paid by the word, and the story meanders from one amusing misadventure to another with little cohesion. That poor pacing certainly isn’t helped by the XP-gating that happens between each act, where you’ll need to hit an increasingly more difficult to reach Adventurer Rank to advance to the next quest. But since you'll spend most of your time roaming the world and making your own stories as you rank up instead of listening to people explain whatever the heck an Anemoculus is, that messy structure isn't a dealbreaker. And, with a few exceptions, the cast of quirky characters (a whopping 23 of which are playable) are a lot of fun to interact with and play as, even if I occasionally rolled my eyes when they made repeated and very uncalled for horny comments for no reason at all – yay, anime.  The real star here is Teyvat itself, a world that is absolutely bursting at the seams with possibilities. Every nook and cranny is loaded with collectibles to power your characters up with, chests to discover and pull loot from, puzzles to solve, enemies to take down, challenges to complete, dungeons to tackle, relentless bosses to fight, and quests to pursue. It’s actually almost distressing how much there is to do. In any given area in the massive world map, there always seemed to be about five or more things in my immediate field of view to pursue, each with their own challenges and rewards. Sometimes it's difficult just to stay on task and complete major quests simply because there’s such an embarrassment of riches available to you as you explore the world. A locked chest that catches the corner of your eye might lead to an impromptu quest or multi-step puzzle. Following a fluttering blue fairy might lead to a massive combat encounter or even a lengthy boss fight. It’s a disgustingly addictive chain reaction of things to do in the best possible way. dir=""ltr""  It doesn’t hurt that the world of Teyvat is absolutely gorgeous to look at and listen to throughout, with the notable exception of some occasional obligatory over-the-top anime voice acting. Although it borrows more than it invents in terms of presentation, the sights and sounds of this world are still a joy to behold, with breathtaking vistas around every corner and a memorable soundtrack to back them up. On the PS4 and mobile, sometimes you’ll fast travel into an area before it finishes loading and have to wait for the world to catch up with you, but aside from those occasional hiccups, Genshin Impact looks and performs remarkably well. Once you start unlocking new characters, each with their own fighting style, abilities, and elemental affinities, the world takes on different shapes as you gain completely new ways of interacting with it. What was once a lake too vast for you to swim across becomes easily traversable with the help of a cryo-type character like Kaeya that can simply freeze the water. Mountain peaks once too steep to climb become simple to reach once you unlock Venti and his ability to create wind currents wherever he pleases. Just when I thought I understood what my time in Teyvat was going to look like, I unlocked a new character, item, or ability that completely changed the way I played and reinvigorated my excitement for the next dozen hours of obsessive loot chasing. Combat revolves around instantly switching between a party of up to four characters to shoot, hack, and explode through a broad assortment of enemy types. Each character comes equipped with their own elemental type and a few abilities that utilize that element. By switching between characters and using their powers synergistically you can unleash some seriously effective combinations. For example, if you use Xingqui’s water abilities to get the enemy wet, then follow up with Fischl’s electric attack, damage is multiplied and can wipe out a boatload of baddies in one go. dir=""ltr""  Filling out your roster of playable characters, weapons, and items, and discovering the ways in which they interact with one another becomes vital to your combat efficiency, especially for certain challenges that require you to finish the encounter before a timer runs out. This becomes particularly important as you approach the current endgame and enemies become more dangerous and gain beefy health bars, especially bosses. Whether you’re fighting a giant wolf who ruins your day with ice attacks that are just plain mean or taking on a flaming plant with some truly disgusting inferno abilities, using every tool at your disposal becomes indispensable. Genshin Impact can also be played co-op after reaching Adventure Rank 16, but at the moment this feature feels pretty tacked on. You can host or join another player to tackle challenges and take down bosses together, but in the vast majority of cases the guest is unable to reap the rewards from any activities you complete. That's too bad, because adventuring with a friend can actually be a lot of fun – but when one of you is locked out of nearly all loot and progression, merely able to help out in combat, it’s just not rewarding enough to do for more than a short time.  Despite it taking me 120 hours to reach the end of its story quests, Genshin Impact is technically incomplete at the moment, with only two (sizeable) world areas, one complete chapter of its overarching story, and two-thirds of the next one currently accessible. While the prologue is playable in its entirety, the chapter that follows does not have a third act at this time. At the time of this review, developer miHoYo has not provided a roadmap with details as to when we can expect new chapters to be added, though a third region of the map is planned for later this year. That said, there is plenty already here, and the prospect of any coming content updates feel more like MMO expansions than something akin to an early access update.  Genshin Impact is entirely free, but the elephant in the room is its “gacha” model – also known as loot boxes – that tempts you to spend both in-game currency and real money on randomized characters, loot, consumables, and more. The ecosystem certainly flirts with being pay-to-win (a slightly less meaningful issue in a game with a focus on single-player and no PvP), but manages to strike a decent balance so that those who don't want to spend a dime can still enjoy the whole game for free. While it’s true that all the most powerful characters and weapons can immediately be acquired by investing enough money into loot boxes, they can technically be unlocked by getting lucky with the free currency provided as well –  or if, like me, you manage to play over 120 hours in two weeks without paying anything at all and grind them out through sheer persistence. But more importantly, those powerful weapons and characters are by no means a requirement to advance, and I found myself breezing through most challenges through skill and grinding alone until I finally got lucky with some formidable unlocks that made the going much easier. The real trouble with the gacha model comes in the later stages of progression, when the grind for account-wide “adventure XP” and upgrade materials becomes an exponentially steeper climb and time-gated activities that reward those things become a massive progression roadblock… which can be lifted for the right price, of course. This means that those willing to shell out some money are able to advance through the endgame much faster than non-paying players, who will have to play a heck of a lot more to catch up. In fact, just about every item in Genshin Impact can be acquired with enough help from your wallet, and anytime you run up against one of these barriers, you can be sure a pop-up will come to remind you exactly how you can overcome it. Admittedly it took about 40-50 hours of play before that wall really started to loom in front of me, but once it hits progression can slow substantially. The good news is that I still enjoyed almost every part of Genshin Impact’s grind, even after more than 100 hours. The gameplay loop of exploring the world, solving puzzles, beating up baddies, completing quests, and unlocking new characters and equipment to upgrade and experiment with is incredibly addictive. Even in later stages when lucrative quests dry up and you’re left to wander Teyvat solving puzzles and finding hidden chests for slivers of XP and loot, it’s hard to complain when all of that is still a ton of fun. Even if the temptation to pull out your credit card is ever-present and sometimes in your face, the grind (so far) hasn’t been unpleasant enough to make the experience painful for me as a free player. Genshin Impact is an amazing open-world adventure that draws heavily on both its Breath of the Wild and anime inspirations to create something truly special. Even if the gacha model introduces some undesirable level grinding deeper in, the excellent combat, addictive exploration, and beautiful world make this one of the most exciting games I've played all year. "
315,ogue Company ,7.0,"From the very first moment its main menu loads, Rogue Company radiates bold personality. You’re immediately punched in the ears by a surprisingly catchy hip hop-infused soundtrack playing alongside a raucous cast of unique characters. This free-to-play, team-based shooter combines facets from many of the most successful FPSes already out there, from Overwatch to Counter-Strike, to deliver a fun package that requires skill, patience, and an appreciation for teamwork to succeed – even if that also means it’s lacking in originality. Rogue Company is a multiplayer-only third-person shooter with a gallery of interesting characters called Rogues, each with their own distinct abilities, loadouts, and perks to choose from. Moment-to-moment gunplay is snappy and responsive, but movement is a little light and floaty. You eventually get used to it, but at first it feels a bit like characters are skating around the map. Since everyone can dodge roll, fire fights can get very tense and erratic quickly, which helps combat stand out (in a good way) from the other games Rogue Company was clearly inspired by. Just because you get the drop on someone doesn’t mean you’ll down them necessarily since time-to-kill varies wildly depending on your Rogue and the weapon you’re using.  Even though it only has three 4v4 game modes that have all been seen before for the most part – a Counter-Strike-style bomb mode, a variation on a capture point format, and what is basically team deathmatch with a twist – there’s enough variety in the nine maps and the play styles they require to avoid boredom. Teamwork is crucial, so thankfully Rogue Company is the latest in a long line of games to borrow the incredibly smart ping system popularized by Apex Legends. That allows players not on voice chat to still easily communicate with their squad using quick scripted callouts and contextual map markers.  The first mode listed is Demolition, which has no respawns and is structured a lot like Counter-Strike – it’s also my least favorite mode. One team has a bomb and must plant and detonate it at either one of two points on a map, or take out all enemies. The defenders can win by killing the attackers or preventing the bomb from going off, but in my experience it almost always ends in a team wipe rather than actually coming down to a detonation. Despite being a staple of similar modes in other games, splitting your attention between two points is relatively meaningless in Rogue Company since they’re usually so close together. Maps are small enough that you can travel from one to the other in a matter of seconds, which undercuts a big part of the mode’s usual strategy here. dir=""ltr""  The Extraction mode is basically a better version of Demolition since it also has no respawns, but only has a single objectivepoint that both teams fight over. If you activate a terminal on that point a timer starts to tick down, and if the other team doesn’t kill your entire team and/or capture the point before the timer is done, you win. The point moves each round and it’s always a frontline battle over a mutual interest, keeping it more focused and tense. The size of the maps feel better suited to this style and matches are more dynamic since you’re technically both the attacker and defender at all times. The final mode is Strikeout, which is the least demanding of the bunch but also the most original of them all. It works similar to the Survival game mode from Destiny in which each team only has a limited number of shared respawns. However, the catch here is that there is also a single control point that will drain respawns from the enemy team if you hold it. This addition makes Strikeout feel like more than just a slight variation on team deathmatch, incentivizing a defensive play style to hold the control point in a mode otherwise driven solely by kills. No matter the map or mode, there is a satisfying variety of weapons to choose from. There’s an assortment of pistols, SMGs, assault rifles, shotguns, and snipers, but they’re mostly locked to specific characters similar to other hero shooters like Overwatch – albeit with a little more choice since these heroes aren’t stuck with a single option. Each Rogue has two primaries to pick from in a mid-match Buy Station, typically something like a sniper and SMG or assault rifle and shotgun, as well as a secondary pistol, melee attack, gadgets, primary ability, and assortment of perks. You accrue money for your actions during a match that’s used to buy and upgrade these tools of destruction between rounds, but all you start with is a pistol. This will sound familiar to Counter-Strike or Valorant fans, but in practice Rogue Company’s in-game progression works like a MOBA, basically lifted right from developer Hi-Rez’s own game SMITE. The gun diversity would be more exciting if characters had additional ones to unlock or could customize their options more impactfully, but you’re limited to the predetermined loadouts given. Additionally, all the guns have a tinny sound when shot and lack the oomph you’d expect from a game that’s otherwise full of edgy characters and in-your-face personality. Explosives, gadgets, and abilities all feel and sound great though, which helps those powerful offensive characters stick out even more. dir=""ltr""  I also constantly found myself wishing for a proper cover mechanic. Dodge rolling is a helpful evasive tactic, but control points are so littered with waist-high cover it feels like a foregone conclusion that you’d be able to stick to walls and blind fire, but instead that feature is inexplicably missing. You can crouch at least, but having to then stand at full height to shoot over walls is a bit annoying – especially considering that two of the three game modes don’t have respawns and require a more considered, careful approach to fire fights. Maybe I’m spoiled from the precedent set by other third-person shooters like Uncharted, Gears of War, or The Division, but a cover system would have complemented everything about Rogue Company so well.  There are 14 Rogues in Rogue Company, six of which are available for free. Getting nearly half the roster for no cost at all is surprising, especially considering three of them are among the best in the entire game. Ronin, the confident sword-wielding mascot in most of Rogue Company’s marketing, is an excellent offense-focused character with a great exploding throwing-knife ability and a collection of perks focused on awareness and speed. She’s stylish and badass in a way that makes her a great introductory character and is probably the default option in the tutorial for that reason. There’s also Dima, whose voice is gravelly with a thick accent and plenty of one-liners. He gets a nasty cluster grenade launcher and perks focused on health and ammo regen, along with a solid assault rifle and capable SMG to pick from as primary weapons. Despite being one of the basic options, Dima is strong and fun enough that it’s rare to play a match and not see one of him on both teams. Finally, my favorite free Rogue is Dallas. He’s snarky and very well-rounded since his ability reveals a red silhouette of where the closest enemy is located, which is useful in any and all situations. Plus, that ability fully recharges any time he downs an enemy and he has powerful perks focused on health regen and durability to keep him going. Dallas has a cool, suave look that’s almost the polar opposite of most of the rough-around-the-edges cast. His voice is arrogant with a sophisticated air, so you know enemies get frustrated hearing his mocking lines.  Rogue Company’s in-game shop is a textbook example of how to do microtransactions well in a 100% free-to-play game. Similar to other team-based arena games such as League of Legends or SMITE, the store is restricted to characters, emotes, and cosmetics – that’s it. Unless you really want a certain Rogue that fits your playstyle better, you can’t buy anything to give you an edge, and you can always unlock them just by playing enough as well. Emotes, cosmetics, and outfits are mostly paid-only, on the other hand, ranging from $2 worth of Rogue Bucks to upwards of $10. The $30 Starter Founder’s Pack, which I personally bought after spending some time with the free characters, is a great value because it includes all eight paid Rogues. However, some of the best and most versatile characters, such as Dallas, Dima, and Ronin, are already included for free. You can grind out in-game reputation points to unlock characters without spending cash, which can take anywhere from a couple of hours to a dozen or more to get enough points depending on the character. They range from 5,000 to 15,000 reputation points, or about $5 to $15 when bought with real money individually dir=""ltr""  Of the paid Rogues, I found myself playing as Talon the most since his ability is a radar that can be planted anywhere and pings your map if an enemy steps within its radius. And instead of typical grenades, he gets C4 – combined together, you can spring an explosive trap on enemies just by watching your minimap and without revealing yourself at all. There are other great paid Rogues as well, but it didn’t feel like I was at a power disadvantage for not having any of them. That said, if for no reason other than increased diversity and options, it’s definitely worth working towards unlocking them through regular play, or even just dropping some cash to get them all right away. Unfortunately, performance is a lingering issue on PC even now that Rogue Company is out of Closed Beta. I’ve had two crashes to desktop, and once my pre-game lobby with a friend mysteriously merged with another lobby and we could talk to two strangers before even being matched for a game. I also ran into two back-to-back sessions where my team began the match with only three players against four players. Luckily, matches themselves play smoothly enough. Rogue Company is an entertaining, if derivative, shake up to the established hero shooter genre, mixing elements from various other games to prop up the handful of unique ideas it can call its own. Beneath the seemingly basic third-person shooter mechanics are intricate strategies, interesting characters with nuanced abilities, and plenty of maps to keep things varied. It could use some more work on the technical side, but as a free-to-play team shooter with cross-play on every platform there’s a fun foundation here that already feels worth my time. "
316,I Am Dead ,8.0,"Morris Lupton is like no lead character I’ve played before. It’s not because he’s dead (because if you think about it, a surprising number of video game characters are dead), it’s his voice. Played by David Shaughnessy – whose velvetine English West Country tones are thoroughly unusual for any game character other than ‘fantasy yokel’ – Morris’ voice is your vehicle through I Am Dead’s short story, a narrator who basically knows as much as you do at any given time. He’s charmingly useless enough as to become an absolute delight, floating through the plot on a cloud of good vibes and light befuddlement, without ever really knowing what’s going on. In a way, Morris is a bizarre reflection of decades of video gaming’s amnesiac antiheroes – he too is on a quest to find out what’s really going on around here, possibly even to save the world (or at least a piece of it). Except, instead of some spurious revenge motive, he’s doing it because he was a curious old museum owner who’s quite surprised to find out there’s an afterlife, and his dead dog is now telling him to do stuff.  And Morris is I Am Dead in microcosm – a game as fluffy and warm as its hero’s jumpers (British parlance very much intended), and just as interested in aimlessly wandering as it is actually getting to the business end of its story. But, again like Morris, there’s also a layer of deep intelligence just under its warm exterior. Core to I Am Dead is the idea of ‘slicing’. Morris, having died offscreen, reappears on his fictional North Atlantic island home of Shelmerston as an invisible ghost. In short order, his spectral dog, Sparky, tells him that the island’s dormant volcano is about to erupt, and he needs to convince a fellow ghost to become the island’s spirit and hold back the disaster – he just needs to track them down first. He might be unable to interact directly with the world, but Morris can now examine anything on it in minute, normally impossible detail. Slicing is the representation of that detail - you can zoom into locations, then zoom into items in those locations, and then zoom physically inside those items. Think of it as those moments in L.A. Noire where you pivot an item around in your hand looking for clues, except now Detective Phelps can plunge his eyes directly through the molecular structure of those objects. Travelling across multiple brightly-coloured areas of the island in turn – from a lighthouse-turned-yoga-retreat to the ragtag group of vessels that fills its harbour – you’ll be able to slice through hundreds of individual items. Some are inconsequential, but gorgeous: dull rocks reveal beautiful internal crystalline patterns, a ship’s computer shows off intricate circuitry, a toilet cistern contains a stowaway lobster. Others feel more redolent of stories to be told: a pocket holds a keepsake from a long-lost friend, a bush with a shovel stuck in it might hide secrets beneath ground level, a person’s mind reveals their memories. Slicing becomes the core of practically every interaction you have with I Am Dead’s world, and it’s a deeply enjoyable one, offering a feeling of constantly being on the verge of finding another secret. dir=""ltr""  Primarily, that mechanic is translated into a treasure hunt. In each stage, you’re given a (very dead) individual to learn about. You do that by finding still-living Shelmerston residents who knew them, and peering through their memories to learn of objects that may have been significant to them in the past – a veteran’s war medal, an old coin – then tracking those items down in the present day. Some of them will be exactly where you’re told they were, and others may have moved in the intervening years, requiring a combination of light deduction and ghost-magic to find. Track down five of those objects and you’ll be able to summon and speak to your fellow phantom. That complete, you’ll move onto the next, as Morris surveys the island’s deceased population for a suitable candidate, and finds out more about Shelmerston’s history in the process. It leads you through a truly lovely story, warm-hearted but rarely twee, and with more than a little to say about death, love, and the meaning of home. It’s all very elegant, and also extremely easy. Those with memories of the dead are clearly marked, and there’s no puzzle involved in working out what the items you need are. Each set of memories is a narrative told in what amounts to a series of comic book panels, that need to be unscrambled by simply holding the right arrow key until the picture becomes clear. The item in question is always highlighted to show you what’s next on the list. Once that’s through, the treasure hunt itself always takes place in the small area immediately surrounding the person whose memory you’ve witnessed, meaning there’s very limited scope for where the items might be hidden. I can’t pretend that, by I Am Dead’s latter stages, I wasn’t yearning for a little more from all of this – whether that was a more riddle-like set of memories, or a multi-stage quest that sent me discovering multiple items to lead me to the last one. In a game world littered with not just explorable spaces, but explorable items, it feels slightly strange to not be asked to, you know, explore very much to pass through it. This isn’t to say I Am Dead doesn’t offer challenges beyond the core story, however. The second objective of any area is to track down Grenkins – island spirits that are released by finding an object that, when sliced through at a certain angle, matches a given pattern. It’s a little difficult to explain without a visual aid, so here’s a gif to show you what I mean: Mr. Whitstable is a cackling, Scottish goat-clown who appears when you find specific posters in each area. Those posters are covered in what Mr. Whitstable repeatedly calls riddles, but are probably closer to cryptic clues, each one slyly indicating an item hidden in the wider world. They’re undoubtedly the toughest game element I Am Dead offers, each one asking you to find (sometimes deeply) camouflaged items somewhere in the entire level you’re in, within a short time limit. They made up by far the most enjoyably tricky aspect of I Am Dead for me, but are definitively a side-quest, rewarded with very little more than a few scant voice lines and, admittedly, an enjoyably strange final payoff. The separation of the core story and those tougher challenges feels like something of a compromise from developer Hollow Ponds to me, an attempt to offer both an easygoing narrative and something for those who want to be tested, when both sides could perhaps be made more satisfying by combining them. But, to be fair, there is more here than a simple start-to-end tale and the mechanics that power it along. I Am Dead’s creators, Richard Hogg and Ricky Haggett previously helped birth Hohokum, the PlayStation exclusive about… well, it’s hard to say what Hohokum is about per se, but it definitely involved being a sort of cosmic spermatozoa that helped people in abstract landscapes. I Am Dead is more traditionally ‘game-y’ than Hohokum – it has a set storyline, a traditional world map, well-defined objectives, and clearly explained mechanics – but it shares a pleasure in relaxed, aimless exploration. For every player yearning for a touch more challenge, there will be another who’s happy simply to float through the sea-sprayed shops of Shelmerston Harbour, peeking inside their less-travelled corners simply to see if the shopkeeper’s hiding booze in their cupboards, or if there’s anything tucked in the pile of rubbish out back. There are surprises everywhere, helped along by a light surreality that sees the extremely British setting sharing space with a race of talking fishpeople, a famous artist with an apple for a head, and a recurring subplot about bootlegging whisky. Look around enough and you’ll realise that there are other stories appearing alongside the one you’re helping Morris unravel, told across the scenes you explore along the way. Like the slicing mechanic itself, the deeper you look, the more interesting I Am Dead tends to become. You’ll probably know already if this more freeform kind of experience will appeal to you. Some will rush through the four-hour story and feel hard done by. For myself, I loved the feeling of being rewarded with extra knowledge, backstory, and good old-fashioned jokes simply for being curious. That doesn’t mean I stopped wishing for more of the traditional game at the heart of I Am Dead, but being offered a competing interest made that far less of a problem. Like Morris Lupton himself, it feels like I Am Dead doesn’t quite know what it is. It’s simultaneously an easygoing puzzle game, a gorgeously gentle but affecting set of homespun stories, and an intricate, experimental exploration experience. The beauty of this is that it never feels the need to commit to one focus – I ended up pivoting between all three ideas organically; playing, toying and learning by turn as I sifted through Shelmerston’s array of explorable still life objects. Neither Morris nor I Am Dead are perfect – but I sort of love them anyway. "
317,Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time ,8.0,"Do you ever wish you could wipe a few underwhelming sequels from history and pick up where the last good one left off? You know, like what Superman Returns or Terminator: Dark Fate tried to do? Well, with Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time, developer Toys for Bob actually pulls off the half-reboot, half-continuation idea. This is a direct sequel to Naughty Dog’s original trilogy that concluded in 1998, and this team really gets Crash. It’s all the characters and action platforming I loved about the old games but with a bunch of great new ideas mixed in so well that they feel like they were always supposed to be there. Crash Bandicoot 4 makes rapid-fire homages to Crash’s past, picking up where Warped left off and having Crash’s biggest and most delightfully hammy villains, N. Trophy and Neo Cortex break out of prison along with Uka Uka and trot out a typical video game villain plan to take over the multiverse. Crash has always been about the action, but the self-aware, amusing script walks the careful line of winking self-awareness that this sequel has come so many years later while also telling a genuinely funny, personable story. And it’s one that Toys for Bob tells well through Crash’s main campaign, which took me about nine or so hours to beat… but with only a 34% completion rating. The other 66% is, among other things, an entire gamut of challenges to complete. (More on that later.) Crash 4 keeps the main story progression linear, reverting to an overworld map similar to Crash 1’s rather than the hub rooms of Crash 2 and 3 that I personally preferred. My initial surprise with that decision aside, the setup works well enough to keep momentum going as I bounced from one pop-up storybook-esque time period map to the next, and Toys for Bob imbues even that overworld map with plenty of charm. From level landmarks to side characters waiting for their turn in the spotlight and obvious spaces for unlockable bonus levels, it’s not only easy to get around but a visual treat, too.  This is true from large scale decisions like building each level with more objectives (such as finding a certain percentage of Wumpa fruit, unlocking all crates, finding a hidden gem, and only dying so many times) to design choices like putting you through increasingly long and complex sequences that require perfect dashes, jumps, and spins against enemies. Those make Crash 4’s imaginative worlds some of my favorite of the series. One of the very best new ideas comes when the four Quantum Masks are thrown into the mix and you get access to powers like gravity bending, time slowdown, and more. Gravity alterations always break my brain, and I died while mistiming a quick gravity swap and falling or ascending straight into oblivion more often than with any other mask – but what could come off as passing gimmicks in a lesser game feel smartly integrated into the challenge and flow of levels of Crash 4. Toys for Bob finds more and more unique ways to kill Crash... I mean test my platforming skills as the difficulty ramps up at a reasonable pace.  New enemy types like hungry sand sharks and giant lightning locusts, twisty jumping sections, and all of Crash’s new moves blend together so it never has to resort to stale carbon copies of past challenges. If a memorable obstacle is repeated, it’s often creatively revamped in a more challenging way, such as the return of Crash’s surfing jet board from the original trilogy. Not every new addition is a winner; I am not a fan of the fire-spewing crates added throughout levels. They don’t add much in the way of complexity to the platforming, they just increase time spent waiting for the crates to cool down until they can be spun. The standard moving mine obstacle courses require more daring split-second decisions as TNT-throwing enemies and water currents affecting your speed are thrown into the mix. Also, some truly devilish endgame challenges use Crash’s full arsenal, including the Masks, in some of the most difficult levels the series has ever seen. I died more times than I cared to admit, but completing them led to some of the most satisfying platforming in recent years. And while Crash is tough, it’s also largely great at teaching you its new tricks, minimizing the feeling of progress by trial and error that comes with some platformers. Yes, there are still levels where you’re running toward the camera, and occasionally a hazard comes at you without warning, but nothing felt as mercilessly tough as Crash 1’s infamous Road to Nowhere. Crash 4 doles out its challenges in smart succession, ensuring it always feel fair. The smallest addition – a circular shadow that appears underneath an airborne Crash – exemplifies this. What could be perceived as making things too easy by those who find estimating their position without it to be a hardcore challenge eliminates most of the guesswork that came with earlier Crash games for the rest of us. It allowed me to better put my focus on nailing a precarious jump, rather than trying to figure out where the landing point should or might be and hoping for the best. But don't worry, purists: you can turn it off in the options. Crash 4 even makes concessions depending on your progress. For example, if you die enough times at a certain spot, it may add in a new checkpoint crate to help you along. Not that I ever had that happen, of course. Definitely not. And there are plenty of challenges to tackle. Beyond the main story path, there are truly white-knuckle flashback levels: of the handful I’ve tried so far, all are pure platforming skill tests. These side levels take more turns at Crash’s ensemble of playable characters, time trials, local multiplayer and co-op, and the impressive N. Verted mode. Co-developed by Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled developer Beenox, N.Verted is Crash 4’s take on mirror mode – and it doesn’t just invert the look, it adds a host of unexpected challenges that have tested me even on the levels I’ve played a dozen times already. Take, for example, the earliest levels – they turn Crash into an echolocating bandicoot (bat-dicoot?) whose every spin shoots out a burst of light that temporarily illuminates the level beyond his immediate vicinity. I had to more methodically plan each jump, time my spins so I didn’t accidentally fall off a cliff, and more. All of that is an added incentive I didn’t know I needed but now adore as I attempt to 100% Crash 4 as a whole.    The only real downside is Cortex and Dingodile’s weapons can be a bit tough to aim, with no target reticle or way to aim with any finesse: you just shoot in the general direction your character is facing. It led to a handful of flubbed shots on my end, and is something a full spinoff or additional takes on these ideas should consider reworking.  Crash’s more linear track through its levels, however, allows Toys for Bob to really flesh out these landscapes like never before in the series. This not only leads to epic introductory shots of levels with a wide scope that tease trials to come, but also means every character, crate, and collectible has fun bits of detail slathered all over them. From the bits of exposed dynamite in TNT crates to the goofy designs of pirate octopi and the many wacky costumes Crash and Coco can wear, Toys for Bob has given this game the look of the Crash Saturday morning cartoon I wished I'd been able to watch as a kid. And that’s evident in the character designs. Crash stays true to his original form, but his dopey, happy-go-lucky attitude is in Looney Tunes-esque top form here, with Coco providing a more level-headed approach to the adventure. The new take on Tawna redeems the barely-there damsel in distress of the original, making this version a badass with a heartbreaking past. And Dingodile’s kind of just...there, but it works, as his personal endeavors to open and then repair his restaurant collide with the others’ story. How Toys for Bob integrates these characters’ full arcs is great — they make sense if you just blast through the story, but playing their specific levels offers deeper personality. It’s all aided by a level-appropriate soundtrack, which all sounds in step with the classic Crash scores’ affection for driving, jangly percussion tracks molded to fit all the various time periods. And, like much of Crash 4’s joys, the score has a few delightful surprises of its own: I’m a big fan of the twist on the sound that comes when you don any of the Quantum Masks. Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time is both respectful of the series that came before it while also giving it the modern update it needed with new gameplay, depth of character, and a beautiful look. Toys for Bob just gets Crash. Its fresh new ideas, from big gameplay additions like new playable characters to supplementary but no less enjoyable aspects like the N. Verted mode to quality-of-life improvements like the shadow circle under Crash’s jumps, all now feel as natural to Crash as though they’d been there all along. "
318,Star Wars: Squadrons Single-Player ,8.0,"[Editor’s Note: This review is just for Star Wars: Squadrons’ single-player campaign. We’ll have a review of the PvP multiplayer once we’ve had a chance to properly try it out after launch.]Like the Force itself, the Star Wars: Squadrons single-player campaign is a balance. The balance between playing as both the New Republic and Empire, between arcade and simulation-style controls, and between fun and flashy action and blunt exposition dumps. It’s full of great references for fans and charming (if ill-used) new characters alike, all crammed into a series of cockpits that are accessible to jump in and pilot without dogfights feeling mindless.  Squadrons has found a sweet spot between the point-and-shoot simplicity of the classic Rogue Squadron series and the insanely detailed simulation of Elite: Dangerous. You can, for the most part, just pick up a controller and start chasing down enemy ships – but there’s also a nuance to adjusting your throttle for better turning, swapping power between engines, weapons, and shields in the style of the grand old X-Wing games, and countering missile locks. Things like that make flight more engaging and give good pilots a chance to shine without requiring you to literally learn how to fly a spaceship in order to play. The campaign spends its roughly seven-hour run of missions jumping between the dueling perspectives of a crumbling Empire and a freshly formed New Republic just after the events of Return of the Jedi. The way it weaves the stories of two rival squadrons together sets up clever scenarios, sometimes letting you spring ambushes on your other half only to have the next mission swap perspectives so you can deal with the aftermath of your own actions. It’s very cool, and developer Motive Studios continues to prove it knows how to make a game fit seamlessly into the Star Wars universe. Part of that comes down to its cast of interesting characters, primarily made up of your squads on either side of the conflict. Whether it’s the war-torn Imperial Shen with a battle-scarred helmet he never takes off or the mildly Force-sensitive former racer Keo on the Rebel side, each one is distinct and well-designed enough to stand out in their own way – so much so that I could see any one of them as a Knights of the Old Republic or Mass Effect companion without them feeling out of place at all. dir=""ltr""  In fact, I hope they do appear in an RPG some day, because they aren’t used very well here. Learning about them and their backstories is almost exclusively limited to optional conversations in your hangar between missions, which frequently feels ham-fisted for a getting-to-know-you exposition-filled info dump. Those stories are well written and acted, but they are just sort of inconsequential in the course of Squadrons’ events. I always enjoyed listening to them, but it’s unfortunate that you could skip every single one and it wouldn’t affect your experience of the main story at all. That story is an entertaining one though, centered around the New Republic’s development of a new type of warship and the Empire’s hunt to stop that weapon from joining the fight. It’s undoubtedly amusing the whole way through, but it doesn’t strike me as especially memorable. Neither side really makes much of a point about the greater conflict, you aren’t asked to make any choices or even really question anything they do, and your two rival squads never even directly clash like I so hoped they would – now that would have been fascinating. It just seems like a missed opportunity not to do something more interesting with this unique campaign format, where we have perspectives from both sides of the conflict. That said, it does provide more than enough reason to hop into the cockpit and fly some very fun missions. Most objectives do boil down to “you’re in space and you need to shoot X thing,” (which is the entire premise) but the story’s setup for each one makes them feel more diverse than that – especially when you’re hopping between good guy and bad guy every stage or two. One mission sees you hijacking a Star Destroyer, while another has you weaving in and out of ship debris while using old power cores as a triggerable mine field. The dogfighting itself is so good that it never got dull, even if I did occasionally wish there was a bit more objective variety here – for example, it would have been cool to see more scenarios centered around piloting through tight spaces or maybe set closer to the surface of a planet (or moon-sized space station, though the galaxy is short on those in this time period). Thankfully, the places you do go always show off how incredibly gorgeous Squadrons is. Even if objectives start to feel similar, weaving through cloudy nebulas or around shattered moons differentiates them in stunning fashion. Missions are action-packed, but most smartly start slow and give you a chance to take in some of the grandiose sights they have to offer before the turbolasers start flying. That spectacle is present in cutscenes as well, which frequently upstage those optional hangar conversations and make them feel like an afterthought by comparison.  Those decadent sights and sounds extend into the cockpits too, with each of the eight ships (four for each side) sporting a completely custom and impressively detailed interior. The UI is even built directly into the actual console of the ship, meaning you have to get comfortable reading each new interior when you first use them. I promise that’s more fun than it sounds though, thanks to the intuitive visual language that’s established for things like radar, power distribution, and throttle control. All that detail rocks, and goes a long way toward making each ship feel distinct – for example, the Imperial Support ship, the TIE Reaper, has you sitting on the left of a cockpit designed for two, initially causing me to have some minor collisions with things on my right as I got used to the fact that my view wasn’t centered. And while the four ship classes – Fighter, Interceptor, Bomber, and Support – are shared between the Empire and New Republic, each faction has its own twists that go beyond cosmetics. The biggest is that the TIE Fighter, Interceptor, and Bomber have no regenerating shields whatsoever but generally make up for it with more hull strength and agility than the shielded New Republic fleet. Each ship also has different weapon, hull, shield, and engine options to further differentiate them, though what you can or can’t pick is up to whatever mission you are on at the time. There’s no progression or actual unlocks throughout the campaign – that’s left to the multiplayer – but it was still nice to have the reins slowly loosen as more options were introduced for me to choose from. Tweaking your loadout can have a drastic impact on the performance of your ship, and the normal difficulty allows for plenty of room for experimentation without being pushover easy. That means there’s not much in the way of replayability here beyond trying higher difficulties or different loadouts for your own amusement, but each mission does also have some basic achievement-style objectives to stretch for – there’s always one for not dying during a mission, one for completion time, and two for special mid-mission side objectives that can bring a neat bit of added challenge (though not a whole lot of it).  Squadrons also has full VR support on PC and PS4, as well has full HOTAS (flight stick and throttle) support on all platforms, which is extremely impressive. I used an Oculus Quest with a link cable on PC, and apart from having to awkwardly watch cutscenes in 2D (which I imagine is partly why the hangar conversations are setup the way they are) it’s just a phenomenal way to play. You can take in every inch of its detailed ship interiors, track enemies with your head, and more easily marvel at the lovely space around you. The fact that you can play this entire game in VR is just incredible, easily earning it a place as one of the best VR games available. Add a HOTAS into the mix and it gets even more impressive, and I almost never want to go back to a controller. It sounds cliche, but the immersion of slamming the throttle and twisting the stick to weave in and out of Star Destroyer debris is exhilarating. I’ve had a chance to try three common flight stick options out on PC with various effectiveness: The Logitech Extreme 3D Pro, the ThrustMaster T.Flight HOTAS 4, and the Hori HOTAS Flight Stick (the latter two of which were provided to us by the manufacturers for this review). Regardless of your choice, you will probably have to fiddle with remapping controls a bit, but Squadrons makes that pretty painless to do. dir=""ltr""  Using the T.Flight was just incredible for this, with more than enough buttons to comfortably map everything important – Squadrons doesn’t have nearly as many inputs to manage as a sim like Elite: Dangerous – and compatibility on PS4 and Xbox One as well, depending on the model. I also loved that the throttle notches into place in the center position, which is important in Squadrons to let you turn tighter faster. The Extreme 3D Pro was a similarly solid option, though its small throttle and button layout does make it a little awkward to use. The Hori HOTAS, on the other hand, doesn’t feel suited for Squadrons at all. It doesn’t have that crucial stick twist you need in space flight, and too many of its inputs are mapped to double button presses seemingly designed with only Ace Combat 7 in mind (which it sort of was). To be fair, this is a stick primarily meant for PS4, and it even only showed up as a gamepad on my PC, so I’ll need to give it a shot on PS4 post-launch too. And for those who really want to get into the nitty gritty of their Star Wars sim dreams, you can extensively customize what UI elements do or don’t show up, tuning exactly how much you want to rely on your own eyes and the readouts of your dashboard. It’s the added touches like this – alongside a host of wider accessibility options – that make Squadrons feel like far more than the quick and dirty Star Wars-themed dogfighter it so easily could have been. Star Wars: Squadrons’ single-player campaign missions are a feast for Star Wars fans’ eyes and ears, especially in VR. Its engaging space combat is a great balance of approachable arcade control with the added nuance of simulation-like systems, which combine with astonishingly detailed ships and cockpits for the most authentic-feeling ride since LucasArts’ legendary X-Wing and TIE Fighter games back in the ‘90s. Star Wars: Squadrons doesn’t end up doing anything too memorable with its charming characters or interesting rival squadron setup, but this campaign still tells an entertaining Star Wars story I enjoyed no matter which cockpit I was in.

319,"South Park: ""The Pandemic Special"" ",5.0," Normally Comedy Central would be kicking off a new season of South Park right about now. But whether because of the logistics of producing new episodes during a pandemic or just 2020 being the year that broke satire, there's no new season on the horizon. But there is ""The Pandemic Special"" to tide us over until things get back to normal. This standalone installment makes history as both the first South Park special and the first hourlong episode of the series. Unfortunately, it winds up feeling less like a classic South Park adventure than a weird coda to Season 23 no one asked for.  Again, it's tough to conjure enough scenarios stranger than the reality of life in 2020, so it was always going to be an uphill battle for Trey Parker, Matt Stone and their team to find a new angle on current events. Their solution is basically to bet it all on Randy Marsh. Though once the show's most dependably hilarious character, Randy has pretty well worn out his welcome in the last couple years thanks to the played-out Tegridy Farms subplot. Sadly, Randy doesn't seem any closer to giving up the marijuana business. The people of South Park need their Pandemic Special, and he's the only one that can deliver. On paper, the idea of Randy being the secret culprit behind COVID-19 sounds like a great premise. And there are certainly some memorable moments along the way. It's fun seeing this episode tie back to Season 23's China storyline and revealing Randy's debauched antics with Mickey Mouse. You have to love the constant digs at people who refuse to wear their masks/chin diapers properly. And Randy's attempt at ""engineering"" a vaccine is certainly classic Randy Marsh. But those moments notwithstanding, this whole storyline is a meandering mess. There's too much self-aware dialogue, too many random plot twists (like the secondary mustache pandemic) and not much in the way of payoff in the end. ""The Pandemic Special"" actually succeeds more when it pivots to the periphery of the coronavirus storyline to tackle other timely issues like police reform and the psychological toll social distancing is taking on children. Those two ideas dovetail nicely in a bleakly hilarious subplot about South Park's defunded police department being contracted out as teachers. Here the special shows a much sharper set of fangs. South Park has rarely been more timely or relevant in the last few years than when it tackles gun violence, and this episode is no exception. This oddball premise winds up serving as a perfect examination of how poorly trained, over-armed police officers only make bad situations worse. It's that perfect double-edged sword of hilarious satire that hits all too close to home. It should also be said that ""The Pandemic Special"" makes excellent use of President Garrison. Garrison has pretty much receded into the background of the series lately, which is just as well. But this episode proves that he can still click when used properly and sparingly. Garrison only pops up for a brief interlude in the middle and a surprise return at the very end, and both scenes add an extra touch of darkness to an already pretty bleak installment of the series. Plus, the Mr. Slave callback is a standout in an episode full of references to older seasons. Despite having more than double the runtime of a normal episode, ""The Pandemic Special"" winds up making the same mistake as too many recent episodes - it's less than the sum of its parts. The plot is messy and never quite builds to a satisfying finale. President Garrison's abrupt return helps smooth over some of the rough edges and end things on an appropriately dark note. But that doesn't change the fact that ""The Pandemic Special"" is a haphazard mashup of 2020 topics and really needed some fine-tuning and streamlining. If anything, it's a shame we aren't getting a more traditional season anytime soon. Spread out over the course of several episodes, these individual pieces might have had more room to breathe and grow. There's no doubt that some new South Park is better than no South Park at all. Unfortunately, the series' first experiment with a longer, standalone format doesn't really pay off. ""The Pandemic Special"" has moments of comedic brilliance but is brought down by a messy plot that struggles to put a fresh spin on the reality of life in 2020. In the end, the series would have been better served exploring these elements in a more traditional weekly format. "
320,Serious Sam 4 ,5.0,"Nostalgia is a hell of a drug. And like all drugs, it can be dangerous to become reliant on it. Serious Sam, I think you have a problem and need an intervention. Sure, 2011’s Serious Sam 3 felt like a goofy throwback to a simpler time, but in 2020 Serious Sam 4’s brand of non-stop run-and-gun shooting feels downright archaic. It layers on a few new ideas like dual wielding and a skill tree, at least, but while Doom has reinvented itself for modern times, Serious Sam seems to revel in neither moving forward nor backward. It’s just kind of strafing to the side.   The actual gameplay boils down to moving from one giant, largely empty arena to the next, each time fighting enemy horde after enemy horde with an arsenal of straightforward, mostly unimaginative weaponry. Three types of shotgun, and assault rifle and two miniguns, two sniper rifles, a rocket launcher, a grenade launcher… almost none of it feels remotely distinctive. The only gun that feels like it has a real personality to it is the returning Cannon Ball, which is absurdly powerful and fires with different velocities depending on how long your charge up a shot, and if you just roll one out it’ll bowl over multiple enemies and roll around on hills. For such a zany game you’d expect a lot more crazy weaponry like that and fewer off-the-shelf firearms.   Most enemies just run at you and shoot, but a few have distinctive behaviors to counter and can combine to be especially lethal. Dealing with a swarm of flying drones that force you to look and aim up means you’re not watching the ground, leaving you a prime target for charging werebulls or kamikazes. What’s smart about it is that they pretty much all make distinctive sounds so you know what’s coming before you see it, which is essential because more can teleport in at any place at any time.    The problem is that this is just about all the depth there is to Serious Sam 4, and thus its protracted battles become tedious – you can only reduce so many enemies to red mist before you become numb to it, even as more and more of them flood in with the next in a series of waves. For me, that happened at less than the halfway point in the campaign, and even the introduction of a new weapon or enemy only livened things up for a few minutes before settling into the same doldrums again. iframe allowautoplay="""" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/gallery/36617/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery36617"" scrolling=""no""> Other than that, the only other things you do in Serious Sam 4 are a few terribly boring vehicle sequences, some of which are literally just driving on an empty road for a few minutes without so much as a sweet jump to go over. Sometimes you get to drive a big stompy mech with unlimited ammo, which is fine but simpler and less strategic than fighting on foot. But by and large it’s just massive brawl after massive brawl, some of which seem to refuse to end.  It’s also counter-intuitive that the boss fights are actually some of the easier encounters – I never had to try those more than a handful of times. Without spoiling anything, the final boss fight introduces a couple of new mechanics that really should’ve been rolled out earlier. There’s more creativity in that one fight than in the rest of the campaign put together. The toughest fights are often found in the side objectives, which are clearly marked with signs that tell you exactly what reward you’ll earn up front. iframe allowautoplay="""" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/gallery/39472/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery39472"" scrolling=""no""> It’s all just… fine. Challenging, absolutely, but uninspired and bland. However, there’s one area where failing to get with the times has really burned Serious Sam 4: there’s no drop-in co-op. You can -- and really should -- go through the campaign with up to four players, but you have to specifically load into a co-op game to do so. Many times I hit a fight that felt insurmountable and I wished I could call in a friend to help me through it, but that’s not an option. And it’s frustrating that co-op is so much easier simply because you can respawn into the action where you left off, whereas in single-player every death means reloading from a save. I was much less frustrated with the second half of the campaign than the first, and it was almost entirely due to playing with a friend. Just like all the previous Serious Sam games, the main idea in Serious Sam 4 is “But what if there were even more enemies?” There’s not much more to it than that. This style of run-and-gun action is definitely challenging, it’s just getting played out, and the returns on the investment of simply upping the enemy count and adding dual-wielding have diminished. The variety of bad guys thrown at you is impressive but there just aren’t enough interesting weapons to keep the battles from getting dull, and the lack of drop-in co-op is inexcusable in this day and age. "
321,Mafia: Definitive Edition ,8.0,"The first Mafia game was one of the early pioneers of cinematic, open-world action, and an earnest Czech-made homage to Prohibition-era American crime fiction. Back then, the criminals were Italian, the cops were Irish, and the hooch was Canadian. Mafia: Definitive Edition is a captivating, reverent, and regularly gorgeous re-imagining of that highly-respected but not-so-gracefully aged 2002 original. Its brisk pace meant it was over for me within a weekend – and there are definitely a few mission-stalling bugs and rough edges – but it’s otherwise proven to be a very enjoyable way to re-experience one of my favourite games of the early 2000s.  The audio is consistently top-notch, however, from the bark of a Tommy gun to the chirp and screech of skinny vintage rubber. The music is strong, too, from the original score inspired by the original to the soulful sound of Louis Armstrong piping through the radio courtesy of the fresh soundtrack.  Vehicle handling can also be switched between regular and simulation, though the differences between the two don’t seem quite as stark as they do in Mafia III. Regular feels slightly lighter and more responsive – and it’s more forgiving under heavy braking, applying an ABS effect allowing you to still steer under full brakes. Simulation does not – lock up your wheels and you’re going to keep spearing forwards – but it’s easily still my preference. There’s an excellent sense of weight to the vehicles as they struggle on their tiny tyres and I love tossing them around 90-degree corners once I have some real momentum, which admittedly can take some time in cars built before World War II. Motorcycle handling is strong, too; they’re a new addition to Mafia: Definitive Edition and I’m a big fan of really backing it in on the bikes and getting that rear wheel to come loose and line up a quick corner exit. I think the driving is the best it’s ever been in the series, and I’m also a fan of the GPS-inspired directions organically inserted into the world as road signs – they take the frustration out of navigation and allow me to just enjoy hurtling through the streets at speeds that’d rip the wax out of a moustache. In contrast, schlepping around on foot isn’t quite as airtight as the action on the road. There’s a nice sense of mass and presence to Tommy himself and his transitions from a casual stroll to a desperate sprint are smoothly handled, but the third-person cover shooting is a little unremarkable, the simple melee combat is prone to some camera jankiness, and I was stalled on a few occasions by odd bugs that would require me to manually reset to the previous checkpoint. For instance, at one stage I was chasing down an enemy who became stuck on a piece of the environment, but I couldn’t hit or shoot him because he hadn’t reached the section of the chase where we’re scripted to be allowed to do so. On another, I exited an overturned car during a police pursuit and promptly fell through the map. They weren’t major frustrations as the checkpoint system meant only a few minutes of time were lost, but they are blemishes. Mafia: Definitive Edition places shootouts in some lovely-looking locations – from a highly-detailed art gallery to a dark, abandoned farm during a heavy storm, and from a bullet-riddled Italian restaurant to an old-timey parking garage – but it is all quite conventional. I can’t say I spotted anything that’d truly distinguish it from the last 10 years of competent third-person shooters. Completely rebuilt from the ground up, Mafia: Definitive Edition features excellent performances from its new cast, a fantastic driving model, and a beautiful and authentic city oozing with 1930s atmosphere like overfilled cannoli. It’s hobbled slightly by its fairly vanilla third-person combat – and it arguably wastes the potential of its entirely overhauled world by not crafting a few new ways to utilise more of it – but it’s still a successful rejuvenation of the best story in the series to date, and one that can now stand beside 2016’s Mafia III as an equal, rather than a quaint but crusty ancestor. "
322,WWE 2K Battlegrounds ,5.0,"It’s been a rough couple of years for the WWE 2K series, with the switch port of WWE 2K18 being a nearly unplayable mess and the buggy disaster (on all platforms) that was WWE 2K20, which has led to the mainline series taking a much needed year off. In its place is WWE 2K Battlegrounds, a cartoony and arcadey take on professional wrestling where wrestlers can jump 50 feet in the air, swing opponents like rag dolls, toss them into the waiting jaws of alligators, and so on. On paper, that sounds like an exciting departure from the simulation-focused main series in favor of something more akin to 2011’s underappreciated WWE All Stars... but there’s virtually nothing beyond the flashy animations. It may be easy to pick up and play, but it lacks any sort of depth to either its combat or its roster of 70 wrestlers, a large majority of which are locked behind a microtransaction-infested barrier. The one thing that WWE Battlegrounds has going for it is that unlike many other wrestling games, it’s immediately intuitive. You don’t have to worry about chain wrestling, timing-based pin minigames, cat-and-mouse submission minigames, how to set up and climb ladders in ladder matches, how to place your opponent on a table in a table match, etc. To tell someone how to play, all you need to do is show them a controller and say “Here’s your punch button, here’s your kick button, this is how you throw, this is how you block, remember to press the button on screen when you get grabbed to do a reversal, and if someone tries to pin or submit you, just mash these buttons.” Done. dir=""ltr""  The movelist for every character is extraordinarily thin for a wrestling game, even an arcadey one, with each wrestler only having a small handful of basic combos and throws. Worse still, these moves are copied and pasted onto virtually every wrestler that falls within the same class of either Powerhouse, Brawler, All-Rounder, Technician, or High-Flyer. So Shinsuke Nakamura has almost the exact same moves as the Miz, Charlotte Flair has almost the exact same moveset as Stephanie McMahon, and Triple H has almost the exact same moves as Andre the Giant. There are some slight differences, with a few select characters having one or two moves that are unique to only them, and every character has their own signature and finishing move. But aside from that, these characters play exactly the same.  There are, at the very least, a few meaningful differences between each of the five classes. Powerhouses are slow, but have attacks that can power through their opponent’s strikes; Brawlers can create weapons like steel chairs and motorcycles out of thin air and have extra power on their strikes; Technicians have extremely powerful throws and can even cause limb damage, which will cause opponents to stagger around briefly; High-Flyers can jump off the ropes, use running throws, and get to the top rope faster than other classes; and All-Arounders can do a little bit of everything. It’s similar to what WWE All Stars did with its class system, but here it’s less about defining a style of play and more about defining what specific cool things you can and can’t do. That said, my biggest gripe with the gameplay of Battlegrounds, aside from the poor hit detection, is the reversal system. It simply gives you way too much time to reverse throws and attempts to balance that by having throws cost a portion of your Heat meter, which is what’s used to execute your signature and finishing moves. As a result, many of my most competitive online matches of Battlegrounds were also among the most miserable: we just took turns reversing everything, with neither of us making much progress toward ending the match. One final notable wrinkle on the arcadey nature of Battlegrounds’ combat is the powerups, of which you can select three before each match. These are temporary buffs that can either increase the damage of your strikes, give you some health regeneration, or make all of your attacks unblockable. Some are extremely powerful, with my favorite being a buff that adds another layer to the pin minigame, forcing your opponents to mash even faster if they want to break a pin. Of all of the mechanics Battlegrounds brings to the table, powerups are by far the best, and the one that fits best with its overall theme. What it all boils down to is that Battlegrounds’ combat is totally passable as a quick party game that you play for an hour or two and then move on to something else, but measured by any other sort of standard, it falls flat on its face. To tie those matches together, Battlegrounds has an equally shallow campaign mode. The premise of the story is that Paul Heyman decides to create his own new brand of pro wrestling that has him traveling around the world, recruiting wrestlers, and having them fight in a ring on their own home turf. Thus the Battlegrounds brand is born. It doesn’t take itself seriously and is fully aware of how cheesy and silly it all is, but that doesn’t excuse the fact that it is incredibly cheesy and silly. The art style also lacks any flair or charm, and the characters you control are all as one dimensional as you’d expect, given the fact that they are only given two comic book pages worth of story at the beginning of each chapter to establish who they are and why you should care about them. The gameplay of the campaign doesn’t do much to pick up the slack dropped by the story either. It’s just a long string of matches against various superstars, with occasional rewards such as new battlegrounds, new power ups, and – most substantially – new characters. Eventually, after hours of the same match types and having to use the same boring characters, I started to lose interest and just worked to mainline it towards the end, which took about eight or so hours to get through. dir=""ltr""  Then there’s the usual assortment of match types like steel cage matches, triple threats, fatal fourways, and the like. The problem with all of these is that the gameplay of Battlegrounds is tuned in such a way that characters get up super quickly after getting knocked down; this makes match types like traditional tag matches, Triple Threats, and Fatal Fourways, where the first player to get a pin wins a nightmare because it’s so dang hard to keep everyone down long enough for you to secure a three-count. The mainline WWE 2K series addressed this years ago by forcing you out of the ring and making you take a quick rest if you take too much damage, but Battlegrounds has no such mechanic. dir=""ltr""   Microtransactions pervade just about every corner of Battlegrounds, from its roster of characters, to cosmetics, and to character creation. Battlegrounds boasts that it has 70 playable characters, but the important thing to note is that you only start with about 24 (16 men and 8 women). The rest need to either be unlocked via campaign, or purchased in the in-game shop. There are two currencies used to purchase characters: Battle Bucks, which can be earned in virtually every mode, and Golden Bucks, which are bought with real money. Golden Bucks can be bought in bundles of 500 ($4.99), 1,100 ($9.99), 2,300 ($19.99), 4,100 ($34.99), and 6,500 ($49.99). The cheapest characters you can get cost 75 golden bucks, while the most expensive cost 300 (or about $3). Each character also features a collection of skins that each cost about half of what the actual character costs, and there are also a ton of different vanity items you can purchase for your created characters for anywhere from 4,000 to 12,000 Battle Bucks (or 125 to 300 Golden Bucks). This is pretty terrible on all fronts. The starting roster is super thin and is missing some of the biggest stars currently in wrestling, like Seth Rollins, AJ Styles, Becky Lynch, Sasha Banks, Bayley, Asuka, Drew McIntyre, Kevin Owens, and many more, and hiding them behind a microtransaction wall feels gross. The character creation options are also extremely limited and boring when compared to the stuff you can pay for. While there are daily challenges and online tournaments that can reward you with lots of battle bucks, working to afford the most expensive characters in the store is an extremely grindy exercise and not one that I have any interest in participating in.  Going in the direction of a simple, easy to pick up and play pro wrestling game was absolutely the right move as an alternative to the simulation-heavy mainline WWE 2K games, but WWE 2K Battlegrounds botches what should’ve been a sure thing. Its gameplay is too shallow, its microtransactions are incredibly obtrusive, its cartoony art style lacks charm, its hit detection is constantly wonky... the list goes on and on. It can be fun on a very casual level for a short amount of time if you’ve got a group of friends to play with, and it's not quite a disaster on the level of WWE 2K20, but WWE 2K Battlegrounds is nonetheless another in a growing series of misses for WWE video games. "
323,Spellbreak ,8.0,"Standing out from the pack is harder than ever in an ever-more crowded battle royale genre. The kings of this particular hill are already free-to-play on a variety of platforms with years of updates and refinements under their belts, but the team at Proletariat may be onto something that can make a mark with Spellbreak. It’s pretty magical.   Matches are quick and full of action, and that’s due in no small part to the fact that everyone begins with a pre-selected duo of powers from wearable class gauntlets. The Pyromancer, for example, can shoot fireballs and summon a wall of flames, whereas the Stoneshaper can send tremors through the ground to hit enemies and hurl giant boulders. It all feels very Avatar: The Last Airbender and I mean that in the best way possible. In total, there are already six total classes and they offer a ton of variety.   At first it was a bit jarring to not aim down the sights of an assault rifle as I peeked around corners, but to instead fling myself into the air while tossing fireballs. Once you get used to it, though, and put in a bit of practice, it feels buttery smooth, like second nature. (I’m sure I’m in for a short few rounds next time I go back to PUBG as I readjust to something closer to realism.) Spending as little time on the ground as possible can give you a huge advantage in combat since even if they miss you can still take splash damage from the ground around you if you’re near it.  As your Mage rank increases you’ll earn Gold, the in-game currency that you can also buy with real money, as well as basic cosmetics such as name plate backgrounds and badges. Class rank, on the other, hand has more tangible rewards. Once you get Pyromancer to rank 5 for example, a floating beacon hovers beyond you, glowing with flames, as a neat cosmetic. And once you hit rank 6 you get the Fortitude talent, which can summon a barrier bubble. In fact, every class has a talent it unlocks at ranks 1, 3, and 6. Grinding out ranks on classes you don’t even like though can feel pretty tedious.  Exacerbating the leveling tedium, you can be outclassed very quickly against other players that have already unlocked additional talents by investing more time than you. The playing field is no longer level if someone that’s been playing longer potentially has an edge in combat beyond their own skill. Just like in other battle royales, you find gear by looting buildings, opening chets, and killing other players: boots that increase your speed, amulets that increase your max mana resource that’s used for hovering and spellcasting, belts that expand your max armor, and all manner of other magical items.    Cosmetics are actually handled pretty fairly here. Just by leveling up your rank in each of the classes you start to unlock aerial smoke trails when you’re dropping, name plates, badges, emotes, and more. But for the limited-time epic and rare outfits or special emotes other than basic waves, you’ve got to pay the Gold price -- that currency can either be earned slowly or purchased outright with real money. You can buy 600 gold for $5, 2,800 gold for $25, and so on, so you get a little more than 100 gold per $1 spent. This makes extra fancy Epic Outfits cost around $10-15, which is reasonable. Emotes and less rare outfits are just a few dollars in most cases. Wisely, Proletariat has thus far ensured that Gold can only be used to buy cosmetics and not ranks or other items, so there’s no way to buy more power. It’s also worth noting that at the time of this writing there is no Battle Pass available. Finally, a section of the menu called “Chapters” is greyed out -- although the developers have indicated this will be used to deliver the lore bits.   Finally, Spellbreak supports cross-play between PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Switch, although it feels like Switch owners will get the worst version here because the frame rate is far less stable and often dips below 30fps. Cross-progression is here as well, so even your save file carries across between versions of the game. For a battle royale, Spellbreak feels unusually polished and special from the opening seconds. Even as the new game on the block, developer Proletariat has managed to  stand out in the crowd with exciting spell-based combat, a vivid art style, and varied character classes. The single map lacks variety and cosmetics could be better, but it’s an excellent foundation to build upon as a real alternative to the over-saturation of military shooters in the battle royale genre. "
324,WRC 9 ,8.0,"In comparison to last year’s big jump in quality with WRC 8, WRC 9 is a more modest lurch forwards. Several great new rallies have been added and it does feel like there’s been a bit of massaging under the hood – with a better sense of car mass and weight transfer – but elsewhere things seem fairly similar. This makes WRC 9 a thoroughly excellent entry point into the series, especially for rally fans who aren’t aware of the rapid and remarkable improvement of the official WRC series since developer KT Racing took over in 2015. However, if you already own last year’s game you may crave a little more than WRC 9 has to offer. WRC 9 is a slightly peculiar experience, as it’s found itself in a similar position to Codemasters’ F1 2020. That is, thanks to the long-haul nature of video game development and a global pandemic, it’s ended up shipping with a bunch of events that were already stripped from the real calendar long before launch – and understandably without any of the surprise replacements that have been shoehorned into the real championship at the last minute. So it’s been unfairly robbed of authenticity, though in a way that lets us pretend we live in an alternate universe that’s not quite as much of a bummer.    New Zealand is fantastic too, particularly the sections that wrap their way along the North Island coastline, and Japan is an incredibly taxing and technical tarmac-based rally boasting a lot of raised sections of road flanked by streams and ditches that’ll totally ruin your day.  It’s also still pretty incongruous that it’d be up to a newly-hired driver to personally rotate staff out for vacation time, although it’s less annoying this time because team-members don’t seem to tire as quickly in WRC 9. The ridiculous bonus objectives have remained, though, and while the penalty for ignoring them or brushing them away is only slight, it’s still hard to swallow your current manufacturer reputation dropping after you win a rally, all because you had the audacity to… choose the best tyre compound for the job instead of an arbitrarily mandated one. Were you saving those tyres for a special occasion, lads? I thought I was doing the right thing using them to… drive faster than those other blokes.  There seem to have been improvements made to the already excellent sound mix, too. Everything from the racket of kick-up from loose surfaces to worn brakes seems stronger in WRC 9, although I have encountered an odd bug on multiple occasions where the engine sound becomes soft and muted despite all other effects remaining at normal levels. Less ideal is the AI, the skill level of which is now determined by a slider instead of named difficulty levels. The slider suggests more control to dial it in right at the perfect level to match your own driving skill, but the disparity in the AI’s performance across rallies can often be strange, especially when they go from nipping at your heels at one event to lagging miles behind in the next, despite no changes to their setting. The AI can be adjusted to compensate before each event in career mode, but it takes some testing to find the right range of difficulty (and that’s not as straightforward as it is in F1 2020). Splitting through a forest at ten-tenths, the sun above piercing through the foliage and the gravel below assaulting your undercarriage, WRC 9 is some of the finest rally racing you can find. Career mode missteps and AI concerns notwithstanding, WRC 9’s incredible stage design and satisfying handling model do make it very easy to recommend to series first-timers – but I’d wager many WRC 8 veterans will find the improvements here fairly incremental after last year’s big leap. "
325,Spelunky 2 ,10.0,"Let me set the stage for this review by saying that Spelunky is one of my favorite video games of all time; it’s the game that I point to as one of the best examples of emergent gameplay, risk vs reward design, and a model for the roguelike genre as a whole. All of that is still true with Spelunky 2, but make no mistake, this is a true sequel that doesn’t rest on its laurels. One that embraces all of the things that made the original so wonderful while also finding new and completely unexpected ways to improve upon the sense of exploration and discovery that’s so central to the experience. Yes, it’s brutally and often hilariously difficult, but if you can learn enough of its secrets to push through that, you’ll be hard pressed to find a game as consistently rewarding and endlessly engaging as Spelunky 2. This, my friends, is the motherload. Like its predecessor, Spelunky 2 is a seemingly simple and disarmingly cartoony 2D platformer that challenges you to get your stout little Indiana Jones-like character from point A to point B while collecting as much treasure and as many items as you can. Of course, the catch is that those levels are procedurally generated and impossible to predict, and in between points A and B are devious traps, nasty critters, and approximately 999 other ways to die horribly – and when you do die, in true roguelike fashion the world completely rearranges itself for the next attempt.  Not much of an emphasis is placed on the story, but the gist of it is that you play as Spelunky guy’s daughter, Ana, who goes to search for her parents on the Moon after they failed to return from their own expedition. It’s simple, sweet, and almost entirely disconnected from what you actually do. dir=""ltr""  (Oh and you Spelunky pros who don’t fear the ghost and instead use it to increase the value of scattered gems, just know that’s not going to be quite as easy this time around.) What ends up happening is that the more you play, the more a visual language starts to take form that allows you to instantly recognize whether you can drop down without taking damage, if there’s something around that can be used to trigger an arrow trap rather than your own body, where you should use a bomb or rope to find an easier route down instead of taking the danger-filled main path, how far away you need to be in order to avoid harassment from the tiny ghosts surrounding the witch doctors, and so on. dir=""ltr""  It helps, too, that the controls are a dream. You get just the right amount of mid-air control to make pinpoint-accurate jumps with great speed, and just the right amount of leeway on timing to easily make jumps in tight spaces that would be extremely frustrating in a lot of platformers. Mossmouth does do a few small things to make the early goings of Spelunky 2 at least a tiny bit easier than the original. The most substantial leg up is that, if you’re okay with being a soulless monster, you can bomb turkeys for life-restoring cooked meat. It doesn’t sound like much but it’s a godsend in a game where your very limited health is persistent from level to level and the only other reliable way of restoring it is by locating and bringing a lovable animal friend to the exit (alive). It’s also more reasonable than its predecessor in that shopkeepers won’t immediately turn hostile towards you if a random act of God causes trouble in their shop, and you’re given much more light in the notorious dark levels this time around, making them a little more forgiving. But the biggest difference in Spelunky 2 is that it is no longer a linear progression of levels that has you going from mines, to jungle, to caves, to temple, and for the truly hardcore, to Hell. Instead, you start at the Dwelling (which is Spelunky 2’s version of the mines), and from there you’re able to choose where you go next: take the path on the left and you’ll travel to the jungle; take the path on the right, and instead you’ll have to contend with Volcana, a new fiery area that takes full advantage of Spelunky 2’s new fluid dynamics system with deadly lava pools that spill out of control with just one errant explosion. In the first Spelunky, when you bomb a pool of water or lava at the base, the water just magically disappears, allowing you to safely collect whatever was at the bottom of the pool. In Spelunky 2, however, that liquid will spill out naturally and affect whatever it comes into contact with. With water, this isn’t that big of a deal, but it’s a huge hazard when you’re trying to make your way through Volcana and have to think twice about using a bomb when there’s lava nearby. Runs continue to diverge even further from there in ways that I don’t want to spoil, but rest assured, each area is jam packed with its own set of mysteries, NPCs, and hidden exits that all dramatically impact how each run plays out. What’s great is that every path offers its own risks and rewards: I’ve had a much higher success rate of making it through Volcana, but find myself better prepared for the later levels whenever I manage to make it through the Jungle thanks to some of the rewarding secrets unique to that level. Allowing you to have some control over your run based on which areas you want to hit and which secrets you want to try to uncover – once you learn them – is a great way to build on the already incredibly personalized experience of playing through your own randomly generated levels. Each of those different areas has a completely different and distinctive appearance to it to accompany its own set of unique enemies and hazards. Spelunky 2 definitely looks much better than its 12-year-old predecessor – the sprite-based graphics are all 4K-ready and animations are smooth – but rather than making a big, unnecessary departure from the charming art style, Mossmouth instead gave the worlds and inhabitants of Spelunky 2 more personality, and the results are great. Cave drawings on the walls of the Dwelling foreshadow what’s to come, enemies will amusingly trip on bars of gold or discarded arrows, and just in general, characters are much more expressive. Some of them even have some fun interactions, like when two Cave Men run into each other and start striking up a spit-soaked conversation of gibberish. dir=""ltr""  The music, while not quite as catchy as the first game’s soundtrack, has some wonderful tunes that go hand in hand with the themes of each biome. What’s better is that the soundtrack is dynamic, so it will subtly change when you’re on the brink of death, when you get close to an exit, or when you’re in a level with a special theme. They’re very light touches, but they go a long way toward building suspense. On that note, it’s also worth mentioning that even after 40 hours of playtime, according to the many blank pages of my in-game journal, I still haven’t uncovered half of what Spelunky 2 has hidden behind its many locked doors and cryptic messages. In those 40 hours, I rolled credits for the first time at about the 20-hour mark and still eagerly jumped back in to try and find new ways to beat it. The fact that I can feel like I’ve already discovered so much and yet still have so much more to go is incredible.  In addition to an added focus on exploration offered by the switch to a more non-linear style of level progression, there are a ton of new things going on in Spelunky 2, both of the subtle and not-so-subtle variety. First off, there are now rideable animal mounts! But as with almost everything in Spelunky 2, they each come with their own risks and rewards: in order to tame an animal, you must first jump on it and try to survive for a few seconds as it erratically moves left and right, often falling off cliffs and leaving you in a much worse position than you started. But if you survive that ordeal, it’s a huge help. You gain a double jump and whatever their special ability is, whether it’s the turkey’s ability to slowly float as though you had on the cape, or the rock dog’s ability to shoot a quick fireball. Crucially, they also take hits for you while you’re riding them, so even if you do trip an arrow trap or fall onto spikes, your animal will be the one to selflessly take the damage. Another big new idea is that almost every level essentially has another level hidden behind the wall that you can enter and exit by way of special doors, and while this could have been a superficial feature, it’s used brilliantly in Spelunky 2 both as a way to hide some of its deepest secrets and create some fun diversions. One of those is a new NPC to whom you can pay a fee to access her challenge room where you race to light a bunch of torches or uncover as much treasure as you can with a provided pickaxe; there are characters in locked cells that you can rescue for a reward later on; and there’s always the mystery of what lies behind the locked doors of the various shopkeepers. Of course, there’s also a host of new items that can be found, purchased, or stolen in randomly appearing stores, and those can be dramatic game-changers that affect the direction of your run in major ways. On one run you might get boots that allow you to jump higher, negating the need to spend precious ropes to reach rewards that are just out of reach. On another you could find a pickaxe that lets you completely ignore the main path through a level. Or if you’re truly lucky, you’ll find a jetpack that lets you completely avoid virtually every hazard, which raises the stakes of your death even higher. My personal favorite is a power pack that, when strapped on your back, not only powers up your default Indiana Jones-style whip by giving it more damage and the ability to set objects on fire, but it also affects the power of your bombs, allowing you to make bigger explosions that deal much more damage. Virtually everything in Spelunky 2 is destructible, and carving your own path through levels (and unlocking buried treasures as you do) is key to burning through to the exit in record time.  Again, Spelunky 2 is a brutally difficult game, even with those aforementioned adjustments that ease up the challenge in the early levels. The important thing to note, though, is that the difficulty is not due to a reliance on twitch reflexes, ridiculously tough enemies, complex boss battles, or anything along those lines. Every enemy, trap, and hazard has a very simple cause and effect or behavior to it that you just have to learn to understand: If something passes the line of sight of an arrow trap, it will shoot an arrow; if I walk under a spider, it will drop, wait a few seconds, then leap towards me; if I walk within three tiles of a tiki trap, it will poke out spikes that only deal damage on the way out; if I anger a shopkeeper, he will shoot my face off. Unlike other difficult 2D platformers, like Super Meat Boy or Celeste for example, that often rely on elements of trial and error, muscle memory, and/or memorization, Spelunky 2’s difficulty is derived from the improvisation needed to be able to handle these predictable hazards getting thrown at you in unpredictable ways. It’s a unique brand of difficulty that’s exceptionally satisfying to overcome and always feels fair. The best part is everything conforms to those rules, including your enemies. Deadly creatures and traps can be thwarted by momentum-halting spiderwebs; Man Trap plants that kill you in one hit can do the same thing to any Tiki Man; and explosive robots can set off a chain reaction that can cause lava to spill out and completely close off the safest path forward, forcing you to find a new one. dir=""ltr""  Sometimes these rules lead to some hilarious and tragic deaths, like the time I bought a shield from the shop and tried to leave without realizing that the shield pushes everything in front of it. So, I ended up pushing the other items outside the shop, making the shopkeeper think I was trying to steal, and… you probably know how the rest goes. Or the time when I quickly ran under a spike ball trap and shot an enemy with a shotgun, forgetting that the recoil from the shotgun sends me back a space, which put me back under the spike ball trap I thought I’d so deftly avoided. Of course, almost as often these unforeseen interactions work out in my favor and I end up crushing an enemy by accident. The possibilities for interactions between yourself, your enemies, and the environment are virtually limitless, which is part of what makes every new run of Spelunky 2 so unpredictable and exciting. Reaching every new area is uniquely terrifying because you have to discover a whole new set of rules involving all-new enemies and traps, while saddled with the pressure of maybe, just maybe making it further than you ever have before. But it’s in these moments where you’re frantically trying to avoid death that Spelunky 2 comes to life.  Perhaps the biggest surprise about Spelunky 2 is how robust and fun the multiplayer options are. The original Spelunky had an arena mode as well, and while it was a fun diversion, it didn’t feel like a lot of time or thought really went into its implementation. This time around, the arena mode feels clearly informed by other excellent multiplayer indie games, like Duck Game and Towerfall, and the results are a literal blast. Maps are much bigger with better planned out hazards that give each level a distinct theme; there are a ton of options to customize the type of game you want to play, including a Smash Bros. esque item customization menu; and if you grow tired of the craziness of straight up deathmatch, there’s a much more cerebral mode that challenges you to hold on to a golden idol for a total of 20 seconds which is a nice twist on the formula. Cooperative play works pretty much the same as before, which is to say that it’s a bundle of absolute chaos. Sure, it’s definitely helpful to be able to have a couple extra pairs of hands to carry more items, and it's slightly more forgiving because you can revive a dead teammate in the next area (plus deceased players can float around as ghosts and blow things off of ledges with a puff of air or freeze it them with a charged-up blast) but it’s balanced by the addition of Spelunky 2’s most dangerous enemy: Friendly fire. There’s a ton of coordination required to make it through Spelunky 2 in co-op, especially because the camera is always centered on one player, and if you don’t take things too seriously it can be a heck of a good time. (Spelunky 2 also features online multiplayer, though the servers weren’t available at the time of this review, so unfortunately, I wasn’t able to test it out. Instead, we made use of Steam's Remote Play feature to simulate local co-op.) I wasn’t sure what I wanted out of a sequel to Spelunky, given how high of a pedestal I keep the original game on – how do you improve upon a game like that? But Mossmouth took its time and managed to deliver a masterpiece that improves upon its predecessor in ways I never even would have imagined. Spelunky 2 takes everything that made the original great and expands upon each of those individual aspects without ever over complicating the elegant, retro simplicity of its 2D platforming. It doesn’t do much to win over people who already weren’t fans of the original’s unforgiving difficulty, but as someone who is more than 200 runs in and feels like he’s only scratched the surface, Spelunky 2 is a game that I see myself playing for a long, long time. "
326,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 Remake ,9.0,"How do you remake a game that’s spent two decades perched at the pinnacle of what this industry has to offer? I mean, the original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2 isn’t just considered as one of the greatest sports games ever made; it’s literally wedged amongst the top three highest-rated video games of all time on Metacritic. You’d probably be better off cutting your losses and photocopying the Mona Lisa at this point, right? Well, no, because despite the high bar set by the originals, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 is an absolutely rip-roaring remake. Vicarious Visions has successfully brought Neversoft’s esteemed classics back to life, allowing old and new fans alike to experience these masterpieces through a modern lens while remaining entirely respectful to the moves, the maps, and the music that’s been seared into the brains of millions since the turn of the millennium.  THPS1+2 pushes off on the right foot immediately, with a fantastic intro fusing footage of the iconic stars of the original games with clips of the new skateboarding superstars joining the roster. It shouldn’t be understated how effectively this otherwise fairly simple sizzle reel instantly injects these new skaters into the fabric of Pro Skater, meaning they don’t just feel tacked on. span>Things just get better from there. The levels, the moves, the pros, the songs – every element of the original games that earnt them their legions of fans is back with a 2020 makeover. Maybe you played Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD back in 2012. Maybe you think you’ve already had this experience.You have not. Not like this.It’s actually quite remarkable dropping into each of the nearly 20 levels and marvelling at just how authentically they mirror the geometry of the 1999 and 2000 versions of these same maps. They’re obviously infinitely richer with granular detail, filled with impressive lighting, and – unlike the PS1 oldies – feature a draw distance that stretches to the horizon instead of disappearing into fog when it hits double figures, but they’re also wonderfully familiar. The graphics don’t necessarily eclipse those of other triple-A sports sims but they’re quite handsome, and importantly they’re vastly superior to the peculiarly stylised and generally unattractive look of THPS5. There aren’t really any duds amongst the maps but I was particularly impressed by the Mall’s mild reinvention as an abandoned and decaying ghost town that looks like a flood has swept through it, and Venice’s vibrant colour explosion, with almost every surface sporting generations of layered graffiti. Hangar is also a highlight; it’s never been the most interesting level but here it’s been turned into a virtual shrine to original Tony Hawk developer Neversoft, which is a nice touch.Both individual games are represented as a separate string of levels in THPS1+2 – and you can progress through them independently – but beyond that everything is unified and accessible from a central hub. Skills points for your skaters that you earn in THPS1 maps, for instance, make your skater perform better for the THPS2 maps – and vice versa. This is a good, elegant solution that beats having each game as an otherwise unrelated mode, like in Vicarious Visions’ last remake effort, the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy. Those of you with robust memories may remember where a lot of the collectibles and goals on the maps are because, as this is a faithful remake, they obviously haven’t moved. If you recall where Ollie the Magic Bum disappears to each time you jump over him I guess you may find yourself going through the motions a bit, but it’s difficult to fault Vicarious Visions for sticking to the originals. One place where the remake goes beyond the original road map is that new challenges have been added to the THPS1 levels to make them consistent with the longer lists in the THPS2 ones. This freshens things up a little while they last, but the biggest boost comes from the absolutely exhaustive list of overarching challenges that can be completed across any of the maps at any time, from certain strings of tricks to specific enormous points totals. Completing these ties into a new, overall leveling system that earns you unique decks, plus cash to drop on other gear for your skaters in the store. Many I achieved by accident, though others I completed after spotting them while shuffling through the menus. Especially on the first run through, THPS1+2 feels like one of those games where you’re always achieving something, whether you know it or not. Returning veterans will probably have every map unlocked within a day or so, but with 21 challenges for each of the 21 pros plus several hundred extra challenges on top of those, I can’t really begin to estimate how many hours of play there are here. Chuck in multiplayer and the much-enhanced create-a-park tools and it may be endless, especially as parks can be shared online. I predict that some players of a certain vintage may end up a bit anesthetized to all the pop-up notifications and flashy bonus-collection-button-mashing – I know I became a bit numb to it – but I wouldn’t say it compromises any of what’s great here. If you just want to hop in and play through some incredible-looking maps from THPS1 and THPS2 – whether you’re looking to chill, chase scores, or chuck a controller around between some friends, THPS1+2 will satisfy. But if you want to devote yourself to chasing over 700 challenges across every skater and earn boards and other booty, THPS1+2 can most certainly supply that. There are no microtransactions and everything in the game can be unlocked via gameplay. Despite sticking with tradition in terms of the maps, the default controls are actually more akin to those in THPS3 and THPS4 rather than the first two games. But before you freak out, know that the more limited, original movesets are available to toggle on for purists who crave an experience precisely like the original games – removing things like reverts, wallplants, and even manuals if you want – but I’m enjoying the default controls as they are. I have a lot of love for EA’s Skate and I’m fascinated by Skater XL’s technicality, but there’s also a lot to be said for THPS1+2’s big combos and pure arcade thrills and spills. For the young or inexperienced who may find all of this a bit too frantic and unforgiving there are cheats that can be activated to make things easier, though those scores are tracked separately so your kids or your grandma won’t be able to completely overwrite your greatest no-assist accomplishments. If you’re concerned about the presence of such a crutch, remember: this is a game from the ’90s, and the only thing more ’90s than video game cheats are acid-wash jeans and the soundtrack to Batman Forever. Speaking of soundtracks, the famous THPS music selection is virtually all present and accounted for, and that’s perfect because it’s such an indisputably integral part of the original games. Vicarious Visions has also augmented it with a well-curated list of old and newer tracks, so it’s now doubly longer than it was originally. You can toggle them off if you want but, while not all the newer songs are to my taste, several are pretty good. For instance, I’d never heard of Rough Francis before THPS1+2, but these guys are awesome. Exposing me to new songs that will go on regular rotation in my car for the next few decades is exactly what Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater games did back in the late ’90s and early 2000s, and THPS1+2 is doing it all over again. Impressively, THPS1+2 hasn’t just captured the spirit of the originals in terms of the meticulously rebuilt maps and faithful feel – it’s done it in subtler ways like this, too. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 is such a tremendous turnaround from 2015’s disastrously dismal Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 5 that it’s difficult to believe they share even a shred of DNA. The accessible yet tricky skating is earnest and old-school fun, the wonderful looking levels are lovingly designed odes to the past, and the music is like the hearty embrace of an old childhood buddy. It’s pretty easy to be cynical about how rapidly selling us our favourite games again became a central pillar of Activision’s business strategy, but when it’s this much fun I’m finding it impossible to be sour about it. It turns out going backwards has been the best step forward Activision has taken with the Tony Hawk series in nearly 15 years. "
327,Windbound ,5.0,"Washed ashore on a remote island with nothing but a knife and my wits to protect me, I was immediately grabbed by Windbound’s opening moments. In this seafaring adventure you must harvest materials and craft tools to keep main character Kara alive as she navigates through a series of procedurally generated archipelagos in her search for the other surviving members of her tribe. Unfortunately, the combination of exhausting survival mechanics and a paper-thin plot meant that neither the voyage nor the destination proved to be worth the time and effort. Windbound takes an intriguing premise and completely blows it. A gorgeous painterly aesthetic gives the impression that Windbound could be set somewhere off the coast of Hyrule, but that’s largely where comparisons with The Legend of Zelda end. While it does feature a lead character with an insatiable appetite for smashing pots, Windbound otherwise lacks the dungeons, environmental puzzles, flexible combat, or boss fights typically found in one of Link’s legendary adventures. Instead, Windbound leans hard into a survival-based grind that makes Breath of the Wild’s breakable weapons seem like little more than a minor inconvenience.  Before you begin the adventure you’re instructed that the ‘Survivalist’ difficulty setting is ‘the full Windbound experience’, and so that’s exactly what I chose to play it on. Survivalist strips you of most of your inventory and returns you to the beginning each time Kara perishes, and I found those high roguelike stakes made me particularly careful about which beasts to engage with and which craftable objects to prioritise as I made my way from one island to the next. There’s a fairly extensive crafting system at Kara’s disposal, as almost everything in her surroundings - from grass and sticks to animal bones and hides - can be gathered and converted into rudimentary tools like shovels and hammers or enhancements to her boat in order to make sailing speedier. But aside from a basic boat and perhaps a sharpened stick to defend yourself with, none of it feels particularly essential. You can play all the way through Windbound’s story existing on a pacifist’s diet of mushrooms, avoiding all enemies and not making a single modification to your canoe. There aren’t any creatures of significance that force you to strengthen Kara’s combat capabilities in order to overcome them, nor are there particular stormy seas that require extensive boat upgrades to cross. There’s all this crafting to do in Windbound, but no compelling reason to bother with any of it. In fact, the most persistent threat in Windbound isn’t the deadly inhabitants of its islands nor the turbulence of its waters; it’s the rumbling of Kara’s stomach. Windbound’s hunger meter constantly nags at you to drop anchor at every landmass you see in order to search for food, a search that can frequently prove futile when the procedurally generated island you manage to land at has no procedurally generated flora or fauna to eat. Worse still, any food you carry with you is often likely to spoil before you need to eat it. Indeed, starvation proved to be the direct cause of the majority of my deaths early in Windbound as I got to grips with its systems. Still, I was otherwise content to play on the Survivalist setting - that is, until midway through the fourth chapter when, with a full bar of health and a recently topped-up hunger meter, I was suddenly killed by a single hit from a shark-like beast that charged my boat in the middle of the ocean; quite literally out of the blue. The next thing I knew I was waking up on the shore at the beginning of the first chapter, some six or seven hours of progress washed away like a sand castle in a rising tide. This abrupt and seemingly unavoidable demise left a salty taste in my mouth that had nothing to do with swallowing too much seawater, and needless to say after that I switched the difficulty to ‘Storyteller’ and kept it there for the remainder of my Windbound playthrough. Storyteller mode certainly makes progress easier since enemies are weaker, and if you die you can restart with your full inventory intact at the beginning of your current chapter rather than all the way back at the start. But Windbound’s plot is so scarce, and its objectives so repetitive, that once you’ve stripped away the more challenging survival mechanics and roguelike structure you really aren’t left with a particularly engrossing adventure. Each of the five chapters of Windbound feature three randomly placed but structurally indistinct tower beacons that must be found and activated before you can pass through an exit portal. The story, or what evidence there is of one, is mostly told either through cryptic text that occasionally appears onscreen or via a static mural that is gradually revealed upon the completion of each chapter. That’s it. In story terms there’s no reason to really explore Windbound’s waters since, at least from my time with it, there appears to be no characters to meet or unique structures to uncover. There’s just not enough mystery to lure me into clearing the fog off each of its maps, since invariably the most exciting discoveries to make are merely shrines to increase the limits of your health and stamina bars. Windbound hints at an ocean of possibilities at its outset, but ultimately delivers an adventure with all the depth and excitement of a wading pool. Despite its genuinely breathtaking scenery and interesting castaway premise, Windbound is ultimately a let down. Neither compelling as a survival simulation nor captivating as a story-based experience, Windbound is fundamentally all at sea and should be given a wide berth. "
328,Control: AWE Expansion ,8.0,"In the lead up to playing the AWE expansion for Control, I did a full playthrough of 2010’s Alan Wake so I could pick up on and fully appreciate the references that Remedy was bound to pack in as it connected its two weird sci-fi universes. While the short and sweet AWE may not be the full “Alan Wake Experience” that long-term fans were hoping for, it thrills for large portions with its exhilarating combat and trademark peculiarities. With fun additions to Jesse Faden’s arsenal and a brand-new area of the Oldest House to explore, there’s a great time to be had with Control’s second expansion while it lasts and plenty of knowledge to gain for fans of both Alan Wake and Control alike. The mysterious disembodied voice of long-missing novelist Alan Wake leads Jesse to the Investigations Sector of the Oldest House and she soon discovers why: Dr Emil Hartman, the sinister psychiatrist from Alan Wake, is roaming the corridors of the sector -- but not like you’ve ever seen him before. He now cuts the figure of a gangly eldritch horror made up of the unenviable combo of being consumed by the darkness and corrupted by the Hiss. His mutated form very much echoes the distinctively horror-themed tones to this expansion, erring much closer to the eerie elements of Alan Wake than the core Control storyline ever did. These main missions tell a fairly straightforward tale over the course of about three hours, but it’s one that had me wanting to know which turn was going to be taken next, especially as someone who’s such a big fan of Alan Wake’s story. This isn’t to say that AWE isn’t for Control fans who haven’t played Alan Wake, though. Yes, it provides a satisfying amount of extra detail and context to those wanting more Alan Wake in their lives, but it does so without ever alienating those who aren’t familiar. While the thriller writer himself may not appear as much as I’d wished for, there’s a healthy amount of extra reading to be done in the form of collectibles that expands on his old adventures in the town of Bright Falls. These range from interviews with residents to case files about Cauldron Lake and the Altered World Events that took place there. There’s also plenty that don’t relate to the events of Alan Wake, though, including more background information to be found out about the Bureau and some delightfully bizarre correspondence that frankly could only be found in Control. A favourite of mine being a note that simply read, “Hello, My feet gossip at night and now I have to wear shoes to bed. Sincerely, Me.”  The Investigation Sector houses three different Altered World Events which you’ll fight and puzzle-solve your way through using all the skills that Jesse has mastered up until this point, along with some great new abilities. There’s a new craftable form for the Service Weapon called Surge that’s effectively a sticky grenade launcher, allowing you to decide when you want to make enemies explode like pinatas full of red mist. I enjoyed Surge and ended up using it much more than I initially thought, finding it specifically effective at crowd control and, crucially, in the final challenging boss battle.   Using Jesse’s telekinetic Launch ability is still one of the most satisfying feeling button-presses in recent years, and it’s been improved further in AWE. With multiple hits of L1 on the DualShock 4 you can now stack up to three launchable objects in the air before raining them down on your foes. This felt repeatedly great and importantly, very useful, especially against shield-using enemies. Launch is also at the core of almost all the puzzles in AWE as well, whether this be moving power blocks around to open sealed doors (you’ll be doing this a lot) or using conveniently positioned lights to clear the oozing darkness from blocking your path. Those puzzles are the weakest part of the gameplay, though, as they are rarely challenging and often repetitive. In fact, these power block puzzles were my least favourite part of Control’s main campaign, so it’s a little frustrating to see them used so frequently over the course of a short time here. Luckily though, Control’s combat is so enjoyable that getting through these slightly tiresome sections are usually worth it just to get to the next fight. A new enemy type, the jetpack-wearing Hiss Airborne Ranger, provides a welcome challenge and really puts your shooting skills to the test due to their ability to easily evade launched objects while simultaneously firing projectiles at you. Each arena has been well crafted for the battle you find yourself in and take place in the clinically brutalist architecture of the Oldest House -- until you start ripping concrete out of every wall and ceiling that is. In some ways, the Investigation Sector is all too familiar though and a separate aesthetic would have been welcomed for this area to set in apart from the rest.   You’ll still be fighting the Hiss, however, and I found this ever so slightly disappointing (even though the introduction of a ton of new enemies is admittedly a tall ask from an expansion of this scale). The gruffled mumblings of axe-wielding Taken from Alan Wake never emerge, and most of the time the light mechanics you use are relegated to puzzle-solving rather than fending off enemies. Elements of the light-based combat Wake used against the Taken do appear at the very end in a tricky boss battle that took me quite a few tries, though. This final encounter was one of the highlights of AWE for me, as it has you juggling both your health and energy meters constantly while you frantically dart around grabbing any blue shards you can. It really encapsulates Control’s ‘attack is the best form of defence’ mindset and provides a fantastic ending moment, all before a tantalising teaser scene at the end that is sure to thrill fans and leave them hungry for more. Outside of the main story missions, there’s a host of side activities on offer as well. Some provide fun character moments, one man’s mission to find himself a head, for example, but most boil down to simple fetch quests that aren’t the most engaging on a gameplay level. Everyone’s favourite Finnish janitor, Ahti, has a few more clean-up jobs for you to do as well in the Investigations Sector, but again these are relatively mundane tasks such as mopping up mold and dealing with darkness. The best of this batch is the appearance of an arcade machine that offers a couple of enjoyable, if not revolutionary new modes that have you fighting off Hiss in both horde and time-attack scenarios. On top of that it gives you the option to replay any of the one-off boss fights from the main campaign or the incredible Ashtray Maze sequence. All of these modes are presented with polished retro intro graphics and are another example of the beautiful level of detail that has gone into Control’s world.  Control’s AWE expansion is an enjoyable few hours back in the world of the Bureau, but more importantly a great first step into Remedy’s Connected Universe that ties Alan Wake into Control in intriguing and creative ways. Fun new additions and tweaks to combat allow for it to shine during fight sequences, even if the puzzles are left in the shadows by comparison and more could’ve been done to integrate Alan Wake’s light-based mechanics and enemies. It’s a treat for fans of Alan Wake as much as it is Jesse Faden and has me eagerly waiting to see how their stories intertwine further down the line, whether that be in the Oldest House, Bright Falls, or the location of an Altered World Event we’re still yet to see. "
329,Tell Me Why ,7.0,"There are no facts. First-hand accounts have an inherent subjectivity to them, people lie, and memories fade. All of this is what’s meant to make Tell Me Why so intriguing. But while the characters and world are brimming with charm, pulling the thread to reveal the secrets of this fictional Alaskan town’s not so mysterious murder proves to be the least compelling part of the whole adventure. In Tell Me Why you switch between the perspectives of twins Alyson and Tyler Ronan after they’re reunited 10 years after their mother’s death. Over the course of 8.5 hours (spanning across three episodes), the two prepare to sell their childhood home, which proves to be both a physically and emotionally exhausting task. Despite being completely separate from the Life Is Strange universe, Tell Me Why soon veers into the supernatural in a similar way, primarily through Alyson and Tyler’s ability to talk telepathically and rewatch ghostly replays of key childhood memories together. Made up of golden light particles, the translucent look of these replays give them a mystical and transient feeling.  Through these visions, you get to see more of the twins' past and sometimes “remember” details from key events so you can confront folks in town and get the answers you’re looking for. Similarly, chatting telepathically allows the two to strategize their next move, opening up more dialogue options or guiding the other through a task. One of the best ideas is that sometimes Alyson and Tyler have different memories of the same event, forcing you to choose which memory to believe. This pulled me into the drama of these characters. I always went with whichever scenario felt more realistic, based on what I knew of the characters involved. Given who’s involved, would this fight end in tears or curses? Given Alyson or Tyler’s relationships with the people in their memories, who is more likely to be unfairly harsh or too forgiving? dir=""ltr""  I found myself almost equally split between choosing Alyson and Tyler’s memories, which is a testament to how fleshed out these characters are. Like real people, I learned to read between the lines, detect their biases, and ultimately make my decision of whose memory to trust. That said, it doesn’t really matter which perspective you go with. While some characters may protest when confronted with your memory-based evidence, there’s no way to really know “the truth.” This ties in thematically with the idea of truth not being an indisputable sequence of events, but the lack of pressure I felt as a player made my internal debate a bit dull and low-stakes. The selection process quickly turned into a mundane task I had to do rather than a compelling way to twist the twins’ fates. Forgetting the NuanceSpoiler alert for the first moments of the story: Upon starting Tell Me Why, you immediately see a flashback that reveals how one twin killed their mom in self-defense. That the killing took place is never in doubt, but the driving conflict of Tell Me Why quickly becomes figuring out what drove a mother to threaten to murder one of her own children. It feels almost impossible to process and move past something you cannot explain. I imagine that’s what the twins are experiencing as they continuously confront the violence that led to their mother’s demise. Their desperate need to give their twisted tale some sense is understandable, but the search feels unfulling because nothing can unring that bell and there’s no answer that could provide comfort in such a dark scenario. I also felt that Dontnod fumbled a bit in the depiction of their mom, Mary-Ann. There was a nuance between the light and darkness in her character I felt Dontnod was reaching for, but didn’t quite come across in its execution, which focused on her most extreme behavior. She certainly isn’t portrayed as a stereotypical abusive mom: Mary-Ann handcrafted all her kids’ toys and sewed their clothes (as money was tight), she read them bedtime stories, she took them on vacation, and by everyone’s accounts, she loved them. However, we also know she was obviously troubled. I expected Tell Me Why to further pull back the curtain on Mary-Ann’s mental health issues but they’re never explored in any real depth. As far as other explorations of mental health, there’s a depiction of a panic attack and therapy is addressed, but it ultimately all feels underexplored, and we’re forced to fill in the gaps ourselves. It’s not ideal for a story that wants to provide commentary on such issues.  Tell Me Why is full of plenty of choices but the situations rarely made me feel conflicted and the consequences weren’t severe enough to make me feel invested. There’s an icon that flashes on-screen that tells you if your relationship is positively or negatively impacted by your choice, but that never amounts to much. There are some notable, more stressful exceptions, such as having to correctly recall the date I just saw in order to get a full confession, but these moments are few and far between. I was excited about the fact that you sometimes get the option to say nothing at all, but that excitement was quickly undermined by the fact that your character will still provide some form of response even if you don’t. For instance, early on you can accept or reject a gift. I didn’t select an option at all but when Alyson fussed about it Tyler angrily blurted out “Fine, I’ll take it. I said I’ll take it.” While that didn’t result in Tyler getting the gift it still felt awkward to have my character respond when I hadn’t committed to anything. While the differences may become clearer with multiple playthroughs I wanted to feel that weight immediately: I want to have regrets, I want to feel like I picked right or wrong, I want to sit there and not know what to do, but rarely did choices give me that kind of pause. This feeling of pointlessness is exacerbated by the fact that more often than not you’re presented with multiple options of what to say to a character instead of being forced to choose a single response that affects your relationship with them or impacts your next dialogue options. Even in one of the final confrontations you’re given two questions you can ask... but you’re able to select both before ending the conversation, and the order you select them in doesn’t change the person’s response at all.  The act of snooping around, reliving memories, and asking the citizens of Delos Crossing the right questions eventually gets them some answers in a way that’s satisfying. However, though the revelations we unearth show that almost everyone failed Mary-Ann in some way, there’s little that’s nefarious enough to be deeply intriguing. Even the big reveal at the end failed to floor me. To Tell Me Why’s credit, the ending itself is unexpected. Throughout my playthrough I tried to guess how the story would end and my guesses kept changing with each new piece of information. However, my constantly shifting theories felt like they were the result of the story pulling me in too many directions rather than the execution of clever twists that put all the clues together so that they lined up in an unforeseen way. And the answers were never as exciting as the curiosity I had leading up to them. Much of Tell Me Why’s puzzle-solving is tied to reading from Mary-Ann’s fairytale Book of Goblins to parse out key information. These stories are well written enough but having to read an entire children’s story to solve simplistic riddles isn’t all that interesting. Matching animals to the gifts they brought the princess is simple enough that you know the answer you’re looking for immediately, and plucking them out of a four-page story can feel like a chore especially if children’s books aren’t really your thing. Here’s an exception, though: chapter three includes a sequence of several back-to-back Book of Goblins puzzles that are fun to solve because they’re interconnected, and provide meaningful answers to the story. Other types of problem-solving are a bit more interesting; using the emergency exit map to figure out how to get upstairs or slowly learning new search terms to pull up police files stand out. It was reminiscent of Sam Barlow’s Her Story, in which each video gives you a clue for what to look for next, and created the same thrilling anticipation loop where you were constantly rewarded with new information. And, of course, there are some cliches that would’ve been better left on the cutting room floor (after playing Life is Strange I’m thoroughly over selecting worn-out buttons on a keypad, in general). Minigame moments serve to add a layer of humanity and lightheartedness to the heavy themes Tell Me Why explores. I’d happily fish with Michael, Alyson’s best friend and coworker, for hours and I appreciated our warehouse plushy fight, even though it was over far too quickly and wasn’t as snappy or dynamic as it could’ve been.  Tell me Why has a trans character front and center, and it’s mostly well handled by Dontnod. We learn about Tyler’s identity as a trans man not through the bigotry he experiences or by reading his name from before he transitioned (aka his dead-name) on an old ID card or any other “bet you didn’t see that coming” form of cringe, but by exploring his bedroom as he packs his things and through early conversations with his sister. It makes sense, since that’s the same way we learn about everything in Delos Crossing. Besides which, Tell Me Why isn’t a commentary on transphobia, despite episode one’s occasional ignorant comments from supporting characters and gender role-focused childhood memories. However, I could have done without the bait and switch; the story invokes transphobia, only to quickly switch gears. It makes me wonder if Dontnod could’ve accomplished the same thing without invoking the trauma story its writers have stated they were actively trying to avoid. While transphobia and bigotry aren’t meant to be a focus of Tell Me Why there are some depictions of ignorance and prejudice. There’s an optional scene where one character describes the ways they’ve felt unwelcome as a queer person in Delos Crossing that’s really tactfully done. In contrast, the inappropriate comments made by mom’s old friend, Sam, and subsequent apologies after seeing Tyler for the first time feel more like a dream scenario than a realistic depiction. At times, Dontnod struggles to walk the line between being true to the persecution Tyler may experience as a trans man and telling a story with a trans character that is about more than them facing discrimation as a trans person. Likewise, with fictional Delos Crossing being set in rural Alaska, Tlingit culture is highlighted in the environment and key characters throughout. Driving into town, we’re immediately hit with a gorgeous mural that grounds us in the culture of that space. And conversations with Michael, a Tlingit man, led to more insights that fit the natural flow of the conversation. Tlingit culture didn’t play a big role in the Tell Me Why’s plot, as the Ronan twins aren’t indiginous themselves, but having key characters from these clans elevated the inclusion above the usual set dressing. Tell Me Why’s well-written dialogue, mundane yet charming exploration, and whimsical fairy tale angle makes digging into the town of Delos Crossing a good story with decent puzzles. It’s just that the low-stakes decisions and an underwhelming mystery plot left me searching for more depth and consequences in the search for the truth. "
330,Project CARS 3 ,6.0,"Project CARS 3 is a racer so fundamentally different from its immediate forerunners it’s bordering on unrecognisable. It abandons the sim racing sensibilities and adopts a radically different driving feel and a new career mode mostly made up of snack-sized racing and driving challenges. There’s never a time when it feels like an actual sequel to Project CARS 2 – and that is disappointing. Slightly Mad Studios hasn’t just sanded the edges off its previously stoic simulation experience; it’s smashed it to bits and reassembled it using two-thirds of the pieces, filling the gaps with stuff snapped off other racers. There are times when it appears more like a mobile spin-off, and other times where it seems like somewhat of a spiritual successor to the developer’s own pre-Project CARS racer, Shift 2: Unleashed. The upshot isn’t necessarily a bad racing game, but it’s one with a real identity crisis that’s hamstrung in a number of baffling ways compared to its excellent predecessor.  Project CARS 3 ditches the race driver-for-hire model for a 10-tier curated experience stretching from road cars to hypercars, and race cars to faster race cars. Gone is the ability to work your way through individual championships, replaced with a shotgun spray of fairly shallow five-or-so minute events. XP is accumulated, small smatterings of cash are awarded, and boxes are checked. The end result heavily resembles 2019’s Grid and, if you’re a fan of that game’s easy-to-digest format and zippy, stylised take on motor racing, you may be content with this. There’s also an asynchronous ‘Rivals’ mode along the lines of the identically-named mode that’s been doing the rounds in Forza games for many years, and it pilfers the GT Sports approach to scheduled online racing (which, admittedly, GT Sport lifted from iRacing in the first place). That said, if you remain keen on the meaty race weekend atmosphere of Project CARS 2, you should definitely keep playing Project CARS 2.   It rapidly becomes a bit of a grind, though, and the initial payouts are a little too stingy to completely support the number of cars you’re asked to continuously buy to complete specific events. Moving up and down tiers with a single car is a little inelegant, too; if your car’s not currently eligible you have to shuffle all the way back to the main menu, which is ill thought-out.  Each event has a trio of objectives to meet in order to unlock further events, many of which are straightforward enough to be completed without really paying attention to them. Some are overtaking quotas and some are drafting challenges. Some combine drafting and overtaking, but I can never get those ones to register. Others are often related to perfecting corners, Project Gotham-style. Corners are now marked with digital indicators for entry, apex, and exit à la GT Sport, though that can be toggled off. It is arguably a better solution than conventional racing lines but the braking markers are regularly too cautious considering how effectively overpowered the braking seems. Access to higher tiers requires a lot of completed objectives, though you can also buy your way directly into tiers with in-game cash. It borders on pointless unless you’ve also got the adequate driver level and cash to splurge on an eligible car, but with enough upgrades even entry-level cars can compete and win in the top tiers. Upgrading cars opens up tuning options, but you need to pay in-game credits to unlock tuning slots to create new set-ups, which feels like a bizarre piece of mobile design airdropped into a PC and console game. Tuning feels pretty tangential this time around anyway; the AI can be generally thumped without any tweaking. Visual customisation doesn’t offer the same freedom as the deep, custom livery editors available in GT Sport, the Forza series, or Need for Speed; it’s more in line with Grid or Driveclub, with pre-set patterns and decals to choose from. I will say the choice of tyres is awesome, though – I wish all racers had such an extensive selection of brand-name tyres.  The AI is bizarrely uneven, too, depending on track and car combinations. On some of the point-to-point races early in the career I was pinballing off walls and still trouncing the highest-level legendary AI in low-powered road cars by mammoth margins, and being able to overtake 32 legendary AI in one lap of Hockenheim during a thunderstorm seems a bit daft. On other occasions, however, they’re capable of seemingly supernatural grip levels – overtaking around the outside like they’re on rails – and far harder to catch.   Sadly, it’s far from the only one. While the custom event functionality remains, it’s definitely not as fully-featured. Laps are limited to 99, so Indy 500s and Bathurst 1000s are out. Le Mans is out, and so is rallycross. Weather slots have been reduced from four race conditions to just starting weather and finishing weather, so you can’t have races that begin dry, rain, and then dry out again. That’s almost moot, however, because tyre strategy isn’t a factor anymore and there are no pit stops. Mechanical damage is out, too. Cosmetic damage still features but it regularly looks weird and awful, even when tickling the ultra settings on PC. Annoyingly, damage persists after restarts so broken windscreens stay broken even if you retry an event, and the only way to fix them is… crash again. Project CARS 3 seems to have a more saturated palette than the previous instalment, meaning colours pop more, but in terms of detail its lags some distance behind the likes of Forza or GT, and its wild weather isn’t a patch on the F1 or Dirt games. Impossible to recommend to fans of Project CARS 2, Project CARS 3 is a total 180 for the series. It’s easy to pick up and play and the racing here is robust enough for some casual thrills and spills, but ultimately it cribs from so many other racing games that racing gamers probably already own that it’s simply inessential. "
331,Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time ,8.0, A definitive ending to an excellent story is a truly precious thing. That’s part of why Samurai Jack’s return for a final season in 2017 was so refreshing, as it capped off the legendary cartoon show with an appropriately epic and conclusive sendoff. Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time makes a risky choice, then, by attempting to squeeze one more thrilling adventure out of the series post-finale, but it handles that responsibility with care – and manages to be an enjoyable trip into the past of the action game genre in the process.   The setup serves as a convenient way for the developers to pick and choose their favorite moments from the series and remake them as scenarios with you in control. And the ends justify the means in this case: it’s fun to revisit fan favorites like The Scotsman and dog explorer Sir Rothchild alongside less well-known characters like the Imakandi tribe and the Witch Hag. Even the common fodder enemies you’ll regularly hack through are all straight from the cartoon. Everything feels authentic to the source material, complete with their original voicework and charming recognizable mannerisms.   When Battle Through Time does go into the 3D art style full time, every character and location serves as a stunning recreation of Samurai Jack’s world. It’s been a long time since cel-shading was the peak of making games look like cartoons, and the angled and stylized character models on display here really add dimension to the cast. It’s not quite at the (admittedly high) level of Ubisoft’s South Park games in terms of flawlessly recreating the look of the cartoon, but it’s right up there, making the whole campaign feel like an extended episode of the show.   This retro action style is fitting for a TV show that emerged during the same period as a deluge of licensed products imitating gaming’s greatest hits. If you’d told me Battle Through Time was actually a high-quality remaster of a lost GameCube classic, I’d probably have believed you. It plays like nothing else available today, and the fast-paced sword swinging activates old reflexes I thought I’d long forgotten.  This is an eight to 10-hour linear affair featuring arenas full of enemies, giant boss fights, a shopkeeper that inexplicably stays one step ahead of the player, and a score-based ranking system. It all feels like a spot-on replication of a bygone era, but it doesn’t feel outdated. The graphics and the intricate combo system are totally up to date, leading to a complete package that suggests a return to form rather than a crusty selection from the bargain bin. Speaking of combat, there are serious advantages to looking backward, especially if you’re tired of the constant parades of Soulslikes the action genre has become in recent times. You can button mash through the fights on lower difficulties, but the combat system supports parries and combo moves that add nuance without going full Dark Souls, and when cranked up you’ll find that there can be just as much challenge in Battle Through Time’s combat arenas as there is in any area guarded by a fog door. dir=""ltr""  Of course, because Battle Through Time looks back for its design, it also brings forward some problems best left behind. For example, instead of growing stronger through leveling from regular experience gains, you must purchase upgrades with several different currencies picked up from enemies. Awkwardly, some of these resources seemingly stopped dropping a few levels before the end, locking me out of some of the more elaborate upgrades. Even if the currency was available, upgrades have to be unlocked in order, meaning that the complexities of the counter system and longer combo strings were trapped behind useless expansions to an already generous weapon inventory. There are also a few bizarre quirks, like how Jack will only climb up scalable surfaces one rung at a time. In these moments, the titular samurai looks less like a deft warrior and more like a nervous beetle crawling for the first time. The movement is so slow that it’s always preferable to awkwardly jump up the sheer cliffs then navigate them as intended. Even if you’re not a Samurai Jack superfan, Battle Through Time may be worth a playthrough just for the refresher course in how action games used to work and how vital that style can still be in 2020. There are plenty of quirks that come with the game’s curious dedication to the past, but the overall package excels despite them. Following so many slow, tanky duels with skeletons that can take you out in one hit, it’s a blast to tear through countless rock creatures with a single smash of a spiked club. "
332,Battletoads ,8.0, Brace yourselves for some truth: Battletoads – the 1991 game for the NES – is bad. Awkward and stiff controls paired with an unfair difficulty that requires a level of precision and reflexes that those controls don’t allow is a terrible combination for a beat-em-up, and its heroes felt like uninspired TMNT knock-offs. But Battletoads (2020) is mostly the exact opposite: it’s a simple but fun and fair three-player beat ‘em up with enough humor and personality to drive a spin-off TV show – which I would totally watch if they made it. It takes the legendarily awful difficulty of the original and makes it into something that’s actually enjoyable for its short run – and you can still crank up the challenge if you want.   Beyond the Toads, you’ll encounter an old nemesis and plenty of new characters, from a warring tribe of lumberjacks and gymnasts to the new main villains, the Topians. Uto and Pia, the new big bads, are Hollywood producer stereotypes obsessed with vanity and running everything like a television show, and their god-like powers and indifference to the Battletoads make them pretty entertaining in their own right. And I cannot fail to mention the music is a ripping rock and metal soundtrack that has been stuck in my head since I finished playing.    Things can get hectic during encounters with different enemy types flooding the screen from both sides and, in some instances, appearing on different background and foreground planes that you can switch between. But even with all that going on, it was easy to keep track of my toad amongst the chaos. Characters are big on the screen and enemies will telegraph when they’re about to do a big attack so you can dodge out of the way or pull off an attack to interrupt them. Enemies will drop flies that you can slurp up in the middle of combat to regain a little health (how much depends on the difficulty level), so there’s some margin for error as well. Similarly, in part because a lot of the levels end with minigames rather than boss fights, there’s only a handful of traditional battles, and they all work the same way: they’re big bad guys who telegraph attacks, summon regular enemies (giving you a chance to grab flies to regain health mid-battle) and enter grander attack phases testing your dodge reflexes. They’re fun enough, but a bit one-note.   While the campaign is undeniably short, at just three to four hours long, Battletoads has the virtue of never overstaying its welcome (depending on your difficulty setting and standing in the speedrunning community) and there are collectables in each level that add some replay value. I do wish there were something to unlock or an extra mode waiting for me when I’d finished to make it feel more substantial, though. After more than a quarter of a century in limbo, this new iteration of the legendarily difficult Battletoads takes everything that made the NES original memorable and reworks it into a friendlier, funnier beat ‘em up. Entertaining characters with a great visual style, simple but rewarding combat and minigames, and a rad soundtrack coalesce into a respectably enjoyable revival, with its most notable shortcomings being that enemy variety is a little slim and the story is over too quickly.

333,Spiritfarer ,9.0, If playing through The Last of Us Part 2’s bleak world is like taking a cold shower, Spiritfarer's is something closer to sliding into a warm bubble bath. Unexpectedly playing these two games side-by-side this month was a bit jarring, as both tackle the heavy topics of death and those left behind in its wake – but while the former does so through dark, unrelenting realism, the latter instead offers a colorful, feel-good hug. And though I do love The Last of Us Part 2, Spiritfarer undoubtedly sails alongside it as one of my favorite games of the year. While genres can be helpful to quickly explain the structure of a game, Spiritfarer has defied all my best attempts to label it. One could say it’s a story-driven base management 2D action-platformer visual novel metroidvania, but I’d rather just say it’s unique. Its closest analogue might be something like Animal Crossing as you sail on, upgrade, and rearrange a boat full of friendly spirits that ask you to complete tasks for them (if, instead of leaving town, your villagers eventually told you they were ready to die and asked you to do it, that is). Regardless of labels, the result is a gorgeously animated adventure that finds plenty of charm and excitement in what could easily be a gloomy subject.   You play as Stella (accompanied by her adorable cat Daffodil, who can optionally be controlled by another player in local co-op), who must take over as the new Spiritfarer: a mythological ferrymaster who sails an ocean full of fantastical islands in search of spirits to house and, eventually, bring to their final rest at the Everdoor. That task will take you to beautiful villages full of rice fields, snowy lighthouses, and even bustling spirit cities as you collect resources and upgrade your ship in ways that let you explore more of Spiritfarer’s expansive map. Controlling your boat is as simple as picking a spot on the sea chart, the vast majority of which starts tantalizingly hidden. Once you’ve set a destination, your ship will automatically chug along to it, leaving you with plenty of time to kill and a boatload of tasks to do. Spirits could ask you to build them a house, collect certain items, or visit specific islands, but you get to decide which of their quest lines to prioritize. You could spend your travel time fishing off the aft and then experimenting with your catches in the kitchen to discover recipes, chatting with your spirit friends to learn more about them, building structures to make new resources available (like an orchard to grow fruit trees), and plenty more. Spiritfarer’s day-night cycle always made it feel like I had more to do than time to do it all in, but there was little penalty to going slow beyond missing my self-imposed deadlines. As a result, it’s a fun challenge to juggle and weave these jobs together efficiently, but never one that felt punishing. There are also buildable crafting stations that turn raw materials like wood and ore found on islands into usable items through simple but cute button-timing minigames – like a loom that lets you turn different fibres into thread, and then thread into fabric. The progression of finding one type of material to make a thing needed for an upgrade that lets you find the next tier of material is a bog-standard affair, but I did appreciate how little “grinding” Spiritfarer asked of me. As long as I was exploring (which I wanted to do anyway) I could generally find what I needed swiftly enough. In fact, all throughout Spiritfarer, I found myself having to unlearn habits games like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing have drilled into me. There’s an impulse toward maximum efficiency – having every station working on a thing at all times; processing all your raw materials as soon as you get them; always making sure you’ve got seeds in your garden and a literal bun in the oven. And while you can play that way, Spiritfarer doesn’t actually demand a fast pace, and doing so turns mundane tasks like melting ore to ingots and watering plants repetitive fast. Eventually, I realized that I could just plant stuff when I needed a certain veggie or make ingots when they were asked for, which turned those tasks back into amusing asides instead of constant chores.  The spirits you pick up along the way are all unique characters, each with their own story to uncover, house to build, and even favorite foods to learn – and while they may start out looking like the generic spirits you see on islands, bringing them onto the ship reveals their true form as some sort of anthropomorphic animal. Whether it’s the lovably obnoxious frog man Atul or the enchantingly posh deer Gwen, they’re all endearing additions to your rapidly growing mobile village. Each one of them represents a mini story of their own as well, both in unraveling their actual life before death and the literal quest line you’ll follow to make their stay comfortable. Even if some characters are less lovable than others (I’m looking at you, Giovanni), they’re all wonderfully written. Keeping spirits happy through good food and good hugs (the hug animations for each one are just the greatest thing) will also let them pitch in on your journey, sometimes collecting resources or growing plants. Without spoiling them, one of my favorite guests even just gives you cute drawings they made. But the biggest thing a new spirit will bring is a request for a home of their own. Fulfilling that order asks you to not only find the resources needed to build their abode, but also to find enough space to fit it alongside all the other structures in a complex game of afterlife Tetris. Crucially, few buildings are a simple box shape, usually having odd parts that jut out and slanted roofs that ultimately force your deck into a jumble of ladders and platforms no matter how many space upgrades you buy to make it bigger. It undoubtedly makes it harder to navigate (an issue Spiritfarer has generally, as it’s also annoyingly difficult to do certain simple things like correctly interact with a spirit when they are standing in front of a door), but I loved that this encouraged a wild, patchwork look instead of a boring stack of apartments. The layout of your ship isn’t just for aesthetics, either. Each new passenger also unlocks a corresponding resource-gathering minigame. For example, Gwen’s has you sail into a cloud of spectral jellyfish to catch them as they float by, while Atul turns thunderstorms into an opportunity to literally bottle lightning. There’s no real combat in Spiritfarer, but these exciting encounters fill a similar role and transform the roofs and ledges of your floating town into a platforming jungle gym. Suddenly, layout is incredibly important if you want to efficiently collect jellies, offering real challenge to this otherwise peaceful experience – and while I don’t want to spoil anything, the combination of sight and sound in a later one of these genuinely made for one of the most magical experiences I’ve had in any game recently.  Platforming prowess comes in handy off the boat too, as islands are dotted with hidden chests full of special items, like rare seeds, recipes, or just tons of money. There’s rarely anything too difficult here, but it’s still fun to explore forests and mines alike in search of secrets, all the while talking to the frequently hilarious spirits who live there full-time (some of whom have amusing, if simple, sidequests for you too, like going to other islands to sell rap albums). And while ship upgrades like an ice-breaking hull open up new parts of the sea to explore, unlockable platforming abilities like a double jump or glide will let you access previously unreachable areas on land, giving you a reason to revisit old locations in what is a surprising but not unwelcome metroidvania twist. The backtracking can get a little tiresome at times, especially as more and more of the map opens up to you, but the way Spiritfarer chains along tasks is impressive. It took me more than two dozen hours to complete, and I always felt like I had a clear goal I was working toward during that time despite rarely having an explicit “main” objective to lead me. New spirits will come and go from your ship, offering new resources which then unlock new areas that unlock new spirits that unlock new abilities and so on and so forth. This formula does become predictable toward the end, but the characters and locations you see are still so wonderful and diverse that I could have gladly kept going if there were additional spirits to recruit. But as they come, so do they also go. That’s the cruelest trick Spiritfarer plays: it has you feed and hug and fall in love with these cute, quirky characters, having them help out around the boat and building them lovely custom homes… and then they have to leave. That part of the job is explicitly explained to you at the start, but the first time I had a spirit ask to go to the Everdoor and leave this world I found myself genuinely in denial. I selfishly delayed it as long as I could, and when I ultimately gave in, taking them there was a shockingly affecting act. Spiritfarer has a lot to say about both life and death, and the way it says it is largely well done. Not all the characters are as impactful as others, but the ones I did connect with really did make me sad to say goodbye. But while it’s undoubtedly somber, Spiritfarer is never a downer. It’s an unrelentingly feel-good game, staying positive (much like the warm hugs Stella so often gives) right to the very end, even when it’s tackling some very heavy stuff. Part of the reason for that is in its art and music, which are just phenomenal. The way Spiritfarer uses color (especially as the time of day shifts) is spectacular, and all its animations – from unique hugs to your kitty cat playing with a ball of light – are impressive as hell. Its music is also some of my favorite in any game from recent memory, up there with the likes of Ori in its orchestral beauty. Even though there were always tasks to complete, I’d frequently find myself just standing at the bow of my boat with the UI turned off, watching the sunset and enjoying the moment as I sailed to a new island. Spiritfarer is a gorgeous mix of an action-platformer and an Animal Crossing-style town manager that stands out as one of the most unique and enjoyable games I’ve played all year. Its lengthy campaign is full of charming characters with somber, touching stories, even when the tasks between them can occasionally lose their shine. But with little pressure to grind or hurry like so many other resource collecting games, the journey to Spiritfarer’s Everdoor is definitely one worth savoring. "
334,Mortal Shell Review in Progress,8.0, [Editor’s note: we got a late start on Mortal Shell, so through no fault of his own, our reviewer isn’t quite done with it yet. You can expect a full review up before the end of the week.]Mortal Shell was kicking my ass for the first couple of days -- more so than any of FromSoftware’s own Souls games, Bloodborne, or Sekiro ever did. On the bright side, if you're looking for proof that this Dark Souls-lookalike manages to capture some of the brutally difficult spirit of the games that inspired it, my experience should serve as proof that yes, it certainly does.   This isn't one of those throwaway Dark Souls comparisons that have grown so common over the last decade when talking about difficulty in any genre: You simply can't talk about Mortal Shell without talking about Dark Souls. It flat-out looks, feels, and plays like a Souls game, right down to the oppressively creepy landscapes and the scattered NPCs muttering cryptic questions. You see it even in the gait of the protagonist and the lumbering sword swings of NPCs, which can slice off the lion's share of your health bar if you let them land. Even the interface elements venture past mere homage and into imitation, which soured me in a way the other callbacks didn't. Mortal Shell isn't trying to hide that it's riffing on FromSoftware's creations; instead, it proudly wears them like a robe, much like the protagonist wears the bodies of four dead adventurers. Ah, yes. Those are the “mortal shells,"" you see. Without them, the main character looks like a fleshy skeleton of sorts, or a bit like the armored alien engineers in the 2012 film Prometheus. These shells are among the main ways in which Mortal Shells departs from Hidetaka Miyazaki's vision to establish its own identity, and largely with success. They're not just suits of armor; instead, they allow you to fight with the playstyle that (literally) suits you best. Since normal health and stamina bar upgrades don't exist in Mortal Shell, you'll end up gravitating to one of them depending on the situation or your playstyle. It's a smart idea because it's relatively easy to find all the shells with some light exploring, and I'd recommend grabbing them all early on lest you encounter some of the troubles I did. Bosses? I found myself better equipped to fight them with Eredrim, who has a monstrous HP bar that can shrug off most attacks, although his stamina bar is laughable. Thing is, I didn't find Eredrim before I got locked in an icy catacomb with the boss of one of Mortal Shell's three major zones, which made for a fight even more lopsided against me than I’m accustomed to in this genre. Worse than that, I got locked away from the anvil, which is used to upgrade weapons (or even exploring other zones for the other three weapons). And since the boss was wiping the floor with me as Tiel, I had no choice but to improve Tiel, although I disliked that I was forced to do so by grinding out the ""tar"" and ""glimpses"" needed to activate the perks of each shell. (At the same time, I'm grateful it was an option.) Tiel, for example, has some pretty amazing ones. With one perk, there's a small chance that any hits on you will take away stamina damage but not health. Another perk completely removes the stamina cost from sprinting, allowing me to be more nimble. Even so, when I finally mastered the first phase of the fight, I almost screamed when I saw his health bar go back up. But in time, with patience and timing, I got him down.   I couldn’t have gotten past that roadblock without learning a few more of Mortal Shell's tricks. Of them, ""hardening"" is what really sets Mortal Shell apart. There's no traditional block button — instead, you can ""harden"" to make yourself completely invulnerable from one hit, even in mid-motion. Imagine our bony hero briefly becoming a statue, and you have some idea of what to expect. It's a fun tactic that lets you time a devastating attack so it hits after an enemy would have hit you. It also only has a cooldown of a couple of seconds, although that can feel like an eternity in crowded dungeon halls when you’re being attacked by multiple enemies.  And now we come to the reason why I’ve been having such a hard time with Mortal Shell. If you can perfectly time a parry (and you have enough bars filled on your resolve meter), you can unleash a devastating riposte and gain a good chunk of your health back. It sounds cool, it looks cool, and it can make you feel like a badass when you pull it off... but I never shook the feeling that I was gambling when parrying. When I thought I'd learned the animations to watch for, the parry would still sometimes fail.  I dedicated a whole hour just to teaching myself how to do it, and I'd still say I'm only 20 percent better than I was. That's a big switch from Sekiro, where I felt like I'd mastered parrying a couple of hours in. It's part of the reason why I found myself sticking to Tiel: it’s easier to simply dodge away from attacks.   Mortal Shell can be a brutally hard game, but I'm glad it draws inspiration from Sekiro by granting you a second chance of sorts. If an enemy ""kills"" you, you get knocked out of whatever shell you were wearing and end up in your weak shell-less form; if you can get back to your shell, though, you're instantly boosted back to full health and stamina. If you get knocked out a second time, though, it's back to the bonfire — or, ahem, Sister Genessa, an enigmatic lady brimming with unsettling commentary about the bodies you wear. If you get back to your body, you'll regain all the tar and glimpses that were on you when you died—and much as in Jedi Fallen Order, you'll get your health back as well. When struggling I was with that boss I put that to good use, as I used my unclaimed body as yet another health potion of sorts. In design, for all of its shadows and gooey pustules, Mortal Shell’s map has a lot more in common with The Legend of Zelda than Dark Souls. There's a fetid swamp at the heart of the action, but the three big bosses reside in distinct zones: a catacomb, a castle filled with flame, and a forbidding tower complex with portals. You'll need to venture into each of them and grab a gland from each of the big bad guys before the final showdown. There aren't really any puzzles involved, but I like how the design invites exploration and a choice in progression. You can see that emphasis on choice in the shells as well, and the four upgradeable weapons you can earn at the beginning of each zone. I do have some problems with the combat system that go beyond what may be my mediocre skill. Twice I got stuck in the lock-on animation when there was nothing to lock on to, and at other times NPCs I was trying to bait would get stuck on the terrain. (For that matter, I did, too, once.) In a game that requires such precision and punishes failure, losing because of a glitch is pretty outrageous, and Mortal Shell has already used up its free passes on that front. All in all, I'm not entirely sure I'm enjoying myself. For better or worse, that's a true Dark Soulsy feeling, and Mortal Shell captures it better than any other Souls-like I've played. I'll have my final thoughts in the next couple of days, once I’ve finished and figured out whether this is pain or pleasure. Until then, I have a gland to collect. Mortal Shell isn't as rich and complex as post-Souls games like Bloodborne or Sekiro, but it does make you work for victories and learn from your mistakes. It's a beautifully dark adventure, and thanks to its clever body-swapping mechanic it delivers much of the playstyle diversity and exploration of the best in this genre, but in a tidy and comparatively short package with a couple of attractive surprises of its own.

335,Microsoft Flight Simulator ,10.0, Microsoft Flight Simulator is the most incredible experience I've ever had on a computer. The realism, the depth, the almost limitless replayability – it's like nothing I've ever played before. It does so much to recreate the feeling of actual flight, at a level of accuracy never before seen, that there were times when I came in for a landing at real-life airfields I'd seen during my time in the Air Force where I was simply stunned. These are places I will likely never visit again as a civilian, and yet as I gazed out the window during my final descent into places like Jacobabad, Pakistan or Thumrait, Oman, I was seeing an approximation so close to what I remembered from all those years ago that I actually said out loud, ""Holy shit, I remember this."" The attention to detail in the plane interiors, rebuilt virtually using laser scans of the real things, manufacturing documents, and CAD drawings, is astonishingly precise. But it's the integration with Microsoft's real-world Bing map services that takes this incredible simulation into a whole new realm of freedom and realism. Granted, there are a few cracks in the picture-perfect facade in some of the more remote areas, and the buildings outside of major cities are built largely with a clever algorithm instead of by human hands, but it's still absolutely wild how complete it seems. If you want to fly over your house, it's there, in Flight Simulator, exactly where it ought to be. It might not look exactly like your house, but it's there. I promise.  The base version of Microsoft Flight Simulator comes with 20 planes and 30 hand-crafted airports. That might not seem like a lot of locations, but the remaining 37,000+ of the world’s airports are generated using technology sufficiently advanced that, to my eye, it is indistinguishable from magic. My local airport on the east coast of the United States, for example, is tiny and largely unremarkable, but I was impressed by how close to the mark Flight Simulator came while I was taxiing to park my Cessna. Every building is in the right place, aside from a few of the smaller (less than 10x10') outbuildings. It's quite impressive. The hand-crafted airports, built from scans and real-world blueprints, are even more technically awe-inspiring – I’ve never seen anything close to this level of accuracy in a flight simulation before. What I really like is how developer Asobo Studios expanded the selection of ""hand crafted"" recreations beyond just the major airports. Sure, major hubs like JFK, Seattle-Tacoma, and Heathrow are lovingly recreated in the base game, but smaller airports are also here. There's even one in South America that's no more than a strip of dirt cutting a swath through the thick rainforest. I wasn't expecting to find such accuracy for these tiny, more challenging destinations, but I loved discovering them. In a similar vein are the airplanes themselves – the level of detail is astounding. I can say from real-world experience the cockpit of the Cessna 172 Skyhawk is perfect. You could snap a screenshot and share it online as a photo and, unless your PC is a complete potato, it would easily fool a lot of people. (I know this because I did exactly that.) Asobo not only flawlessly recreated the look of the interiors and exteriors of the available planes, but the instruments are also fully operational. The Garmin digital instruments appear and function exactly as they do in real life because the developers built emulators for the actual software that runs them into Flight Simulator. This is the first game I've ever played where I downloaded a .PDF manual from a real-world piece of equipment to reference during play – and everything in the manual checks out to the virtual hardware. It excites the absolute nerdiest parts of my core.  As unbelievably realistic as the flight simulation is, it's also accessible to just about anyone's level of flight experience. You can turn on all the assists and enjoy Flight Simulator in a more arcade-style, or turn them all off and approach a virtual sortie in the same way you’d do the real thing, checklists and all. As someone without a pilot’s license (I was an electrician in the Air Force, not a pilot) my personal preference is playing halfway between the full simulation and the highest assist settings because it still creates a very challenging experience but removes some of the mundane steps from the process, like pre-flight checks, engine start, etc. Better still, since Flight Simulator is coming to Xbox Series X at some as-of-yet-undetermined point in the future, it controls really well with just an Xbox One controller. The elevator controls are a little touchy on some of the planes using the analog stick, but can be adjusted to suit your needs. Overall, I have no complaints about playing with the controller. It still requires keyboard functionality to get the most out of your plane, but there's no immediate need to rush out and buy a flight stick or yoke. That being said, the simulation is much more authentic and enjoyable if you do have access to a dedicated flight controller. I used Thrustmaster's new Airbus A380 flight stick, in addition to my time with the Xbox controller, and it makes flying that much more immersive. Even planes with yokes are better with a flight stick, so if you have the means and if you can actually find one, I recommend picking up a dedicated controller for the full Flight Simulator experience. Just keep in mind it's not a requirement, which is a great feature for those of us who’d rather dabble in flying than make a big hardware investment. The 20 planes and 30 hand-crafted airports in the $60 base version of Microsoft Flight Simulator are already a respectable amount of content. These aircraft run the gamut from highly maneuverable stunt planes like the Aviat Pitts Special S2S biplane, to wide-bodied airliners like the ""Queen of the Skies"" herself, the Boeing 747-8. However, if you’re hungry for more, the $90 Deluxe Edition adds five more planes and five airports, and the $120 Premium Deluxe Edition adds another five of each, for a total of 30 different aircraft and 40 airports. The variety is excellent, although as an Air Force vet I was a little disappointed that there are no military aircraft. I was holding out hope I'd get to fly a C-130 (my favorite airplane of all), or a C-17. A military trainer like the jet-propelled T-38 would also have been an exciting addition, or even a ViperJet. If you want to fly a jet aircraft the only option right now is a passenger plane, and that's a bit of a bummer – but certainly not a deal breaker. I’m not trying to knock the already impressive selection here, either, I'm just being greedy. With that said, I was perfectly content with the 20 planes included with the base game, and I don't really see the need to upgrade unless you feel you absolutely must get behind the controls of a 787-10 Dreamliner or a Cessna 152 or 172 variant. dir=""ltr""   All of that gorgeous detail and accurately modeled equipment is on the inside, but the absolute genius of Microsoft Flight Simulator is actually outside the planes, enabled by its Bing Maps integration. Two petabytes (that’s 2,000 terabytes) of satellite and high-altitude photography  are available to stream to your computer to accurately represent whatever part of the globe you decide to visit. The effect is absolutely mindblowing: I've flown places I've never been in my life, circling Machu Picchu or barnstorming between the Great Pyramids, and it feels like virtual sightseeing. But I've also flown to places I have visited just to relive the travel experience, and have been thoroughly impressed. More than once I've set off from my local airport and followed real-life roads through the Maine woods and into Quebec, retreading (re-winging?) the route I took last year by car. I've also landed on the tiny dirt airstrips in some of Maine's remote inhabited islands, taking in the familiar scenery from 2,500 feet above the Atlantic Ocean. You can even fly in real-world weather conditions with live air traffic, all of which is adjustable with in-game menus that are easily accessible during flight. If you've ever wanted to take off from an airport in a driving snowstorm at night, you can set the weather and time to your liking. One of my favorite things to do when flying is to adjust the time of day to the ""golden hour,"" early mornings or just before dusk when the sun's rays are at their warmest and most pleasant. It makes for some incredible sights. The limitations of the Bing integration come in two distinct circumstances: if your internet service provider has a data cap, and when the existing aerial photography of an area happens to be low-resolution. In the case of the data cap problem, you can preinstall locations ahead of time, so you load one small chunk of data rather than opening up the data firehose. Asobo seems to be sympathetic to this hazard and offers a setting in the menus to track your data use and set an upper limit so you don't go over your cap. After a few hours of play, including flights over San Francisco and New York City, I only used a few megabytes of data, but multiply that over a few hours a day over the course of a month (and flying over less frequently traveled areas) and it could become concerning. (Also, that comes after you install this 150GB monster of a game!) The second limitation is with low-resolution maps, which show up in some of the more remote corners of the Earth, but it’s only really noticeable at low-altitudes. Personally, I find the thrill of flying a few feet above the Colorado river more than enough to compensate for the lack of texture details on the walls of the Grand Canyon. Also, since the data is pulled directly from Bing, low-resolution areas will improve as its database of imagery improves over time. At the moment, though, some places do look decidedly… PlayStation 1… when you're up close and personal.  The act of flying and exploring some far-flung corner of the Earth is more than enough to keep me entertained, but Flight Simulator adds some competitive elements, including landing challenges. A rotating selection of remote and challenging airstrips become a place to showcase your landing skills, with scores being assigned to your performance in categories like accuracy on the runway, roll distance, and bounce. It's actually a really fun way to increase your skills, and I’ve spent a lot of time trying to land successfully on a mountaintop airfield in France. Will I ever top the leaderboards on these challenges? Well, for now, yeah. I actually have a few of the world's top-scores for some of the landing challenges. Will this trend hold once the game comes out? No. God no. But will I continue trying to improve my scores? My inner competitor demands that I must! Naturally, many of those attempts will end with you damaging or even outright crashing your plane. You might think you're making a last-ditch effort to put your plane on the ground, only to discover (like I did) the landing gear on a heavy like the Airbus A320neo isn't designed for non-tarmac use. For obvious reasons, a crash doesn’t result in a realistic fireball, but rather a black screen and a pop-up window that alerts you to your shameful performance – as if you didn’t already know. It's not just crashes that cause instant failure: taking a plane well beyond its physical limitations, like an over-speed scenario, will also end your flight before you actually hit the ground. I found this out while first trying to do a barrel roll in a 747 and ended up descending too fast. That's not to say you can't do some sick stunts: you absolutely can make that 747 execute a successful barrel roll with a little practice – I did it a LOT, actually. It's just you can't make a plane do more than it could do in real life. dir=""ltr""  Where my PC really struggles with Microsoft Flight Simulator, and I suspect this will be a problem for most people, is loading times. Big airports take a long time, sometimes as much four minutes in the case of Chicago O'Hare. Even remote airports with far less going on take at least a minute. I'm certain it's not my PC’s fault, because I installed Microsoft Simulator on a 1TB WD Blue M.2 NVMe SSD, and it’s hard to get a lot faster than that right now. It's not surprising given the staggering amount of data Microsoft Flight Simulator has to load, but it's still impossible to ignore all that time you spend twiddling your thumbs. As frustrating as the loading times can be, once you're into an area it only takes a few seconds to restart if you crash or manually reset your flight. Personally, I didn't mind the wait too much – it represents only a fraction of the total time I spent in the cockpit. It also should be pointed out that, at launch, Flight Simulator doesn’t support VR, but Microsoft says it’s coming in a patch later this year. Just the thought of being able to play Flight Simulator in virtual reality has me seriously considering upgrading to a new headset. As incredible as it looks and feels on just my monitor, I really want to immerse myself in the experience as much as humanly possible. Microsoft Flight Simulator is legitimately incredible. It's difficult to fully describe how amazing it feels to jump into a plane and have the freedom to fly to and from literally any place in the entire world. The base game's 20 included aircraft feel like more than enough for even hardcore aviation enthusiasts, and the ability to adjust the assists to tailor the experience to whatever skill level you desire makes it suitable for anyone looking to fly the friendly skies from the comfort of their home. The real-world mapping data, however, takes Microsoft Flight Simulator from being just an impressive game to the most awe-inspiring simulation I've ever experienced, in spite of its less than stellar load times. Seeing famous landmarks, landing at the world's most recognizable airports, or just touching down in a remote landing strip in South America is mind-bogglingly cool and an absolutely unparalleled way to virtually explore our world.

336,Netflix's Project Power ,3.0," Filmmakers Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, who first rose to prominence as the directors of Catfish, and later established themselves in the Paranormal Activity franchise, have entered into the domain of superheroes. On its face, their action flick Project Power reads as an intriguing reinvention. The concept: People are now capable of gaining superhuman ability through a magic pill called Power. A roulette wheel, before taking the pill, they don’t know what ability they’ll receive: invisibility, thermodynamics, stretch, or even invulnerability. However, stipulations and dangers do exist: Their power only lasts for five minutes and in some cases, if someone overdoses, their body explodes. Sounds reasonable.  These drugs are supplied by showy governmental and medical forces, and are sold by dealers like Newt (Machine Gun Kelly, who has little to chew on) and Robin (Dominique Fishback). The latter often sells to Frank (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a New Orleans detective ingesting the pills in a bid to level the playing field against the rising breed of superhuman criminals. They’re joined by The Major (Jamie Foxx), an ex-military specialist in search of his daughter (Kyanna Simone Simpson), after her abduction by a government trying to harness her natural superhuman abilities. Project Power wears its influences to an aching degree. During a drug bust involving teens, Frank does his best Dirty Harry impression when he asks, “You’ve gotta ask yourself one question: What is your power?” When The Major and Robin team together, Robin exclaims, “We’re like Batman and Robin.” No scene passes without a clear homage to the film’s setting in New Orleans: The voices of local disc jockeys announcing local crime updates decorate the soundscape; Frank wears a jersey of former Saints player Steve Gleason; and Mattson Tomlin’s clunky dialogue repeatedly refers to an ongoing Saints game. Such wonkiness obtusely extends to The Major telling Robin, “You’re young. You’re Black. You’re a woman. The system is designed to swallow you whole.” Subtlety needn’t apply in Project Power. The overt carries over to the film’s visual aspects, as well. Cinematographer Michael Simmonds loves throwing in canted angles with little regard for the desired effect. When Biggie (Rodrigo Santoro) introduces Project Power to a host of young drug dealers led by Newt, a lower angle shot employs the harshest rack focus — from Biggie to the pill in his hand — I’ve ever seen. The over-stylized cinematography and composition, aiming for a visceral tone, does the fight choreography no favors. For instance, when The Major crashes a secretive high-stakes demonstration of Power, a fight ensues between himself and Biggie’s henchmen. During the melee, a woman inside a glass cylinder begs for her escape as she turns into ice. The camera tracks the action from inside the icy glass prison. To shoot one of the film’s most important sequences, when The Major finally meets a prominent villain, from the perspective of a peripheral character, at an angle which obscurs the sharp gunplay and fight choreography to the squint of the eye, suggests an absence of visual discernment. By aiming for refinement, Project Power lacks any. Instead the action relies on gratuitous violence and inarticulate uses of handheld. The single saving grace is the slick VFX work portraying abilities, such as invisibility and thermodynamics, with clarity. These shortcomings are compounded by a convoluted script lacking a true villain. Between Biggie, a bearded henchman named Wallace (Tait Fletcher), and the evil doctor Gardner (Amy Landecker), I don’t know who to root against because none of them occupies an important space. Other smaller frustrations abound: tacky protestetic beards, obvious switches to body doubles, and how the incredibly talented Courtney B. Vance is relegated to a few short scenes as a police captain. But the gravest error in the superhero flick springs from the opaqueness of its central theme: the appropriation of disadvantaged Black and Brown people for medical experimentation. The history of the medical community using marginalized people as guinea pigs runs deep. For instance, the film references Henrietta Lacks, a Black woman during the 1930’s whose cells were illegitimately harvested by doctors, and later cloned for drug testing. Other examples left unnamed in the film include the Tuskegee Syphilis Study and the forced sterilization of Puerto Rican, Mexican, and Native American women throughout the decades. The distrust felt by Black and Brown people toward the medical community continues to this day, especially with regards to Black people disbelieving the medical community with regards to the Covid-19 pandemic. When combined with a New Orleans still reeling from Hurricane Katrina, and the racial inequality instituted by the federal government during the crisis, the socio-economic importance should’ve granted a stronger pull. However, Project Power buries the relevant themes under the weight of action muscle. Project Power’s lone bright spot is the dynamic between Foxx and Fishback. The pair develop a surrogate father-daughter relationship grown by way of an antagonistic double act. Foxx gives even the dorkiest line a sense of purpose while Fishback imbues the stylistic action flick with a semblance of emotional substance. The subplot involving Robin’s diabetic mother - though it’s odd that a veterinarian doesn’t have health insurance - is sweet on the surface, but fades below the monotonous action. While her dreams of becoming a rapper aim for legitimacy, the storyline rarely rises above needless fluff. Fishback evoking any of these odd tangents into any emotional believability is staggering. Especially given the cheeseball ending. Netflix's Project Power misses the potentiality of its relevant themes and intriguing concept for an overwrought reconception of the superhero narrative. Directors Joost and Schulman have come a long way after their debut film, Catfish, but Project Power shows their ongoing learning curve. Fishback, Foxx, and Gordon-Levitt persevere through a thin script, delivering tiny fractions of resonance to a superhero concept left at the surface. The pacing drags through action set-pieces left obscured by messy compositions and limp, over-stylized visual choices. New Orleans, as the film’s setting, is wasted while the film’s gritty concept fails to deliver the desired intensity. "
337,A Total War Saga: Troy ,8.0, The first thing I noticed, as a long-time fan of this series, is that A Total War Saga: Troy is extremely and unabashedly stylish. The world is ringed by surreal, soaring mountains that suggest ancient Greek pottery. The battle resolution animation shows the opposing generals fighting theatrically under a heavenly spotlight. The color palette is perfect for making me feel as though I’ve been transported to the Bronze Age world. And this personality seeps over into a fairly satisfying campaign as well. There are some cracks in this ornate amphora, particularly when it comes to AI, but unlike the previous Saga game it’s not a black sheep of the Total War family. Creative Assembly has been getting better and better at faction design with almost every game and DLC pack it’s released in the last few years, and Troy’s playable campaign factions are no exception. As Achilles, you have the invigorating task of defending your title as the undisputed heavyweight champion of the Aegean, with a roster of aggressive, mobile melee units to back you up. As Hector, you have to constantly compete for your dear father’s affection with your annoying kid brother who got us into this mess in the first place, in hopes of eventually inheriting the city of Troy. The tough, tanky spearmen in his roster play great with defensive terrain and holding cities against assault. Each leader I played felt distinct and interesting, in terms of goals, campaign abilities, and fighting style.  These heroes also have their own dramatic, story-based win conditions called Homeric Victories that walk them through some of the highlights of their role in the Iliad, such as Menelaus having to reclaim Helen and Hector having to make sure the city of Troy does not fall. This is a great nod to the source material, and helps further differentiate each campaign – and it’s great that it doesn’t get in the way if you want to pursue a more traditional Total War victory instead. Sometimes answering Agamemnon’s call to war can be a bit more trouble than it’s worth. There are also some special, discoverable objectives with unique rewards, like becoming Anax – basically a tribal king – of one of the map’s several geographic areas.  Interacting with other leaders is often not as pleasant, though. While the convenient Quick Deal feature from Three Kingdoms makes a return, foreign leaders make a nuisance of themselves by spamming requests for absurdly lopsided trade deals, or constantly asking for free gifts of resources while offering nothing in return. It’s an issue that used to crop up in older Total War games, but I had thought we were past it by now. No, Lycomedes, you can’t have 250 bronze for free. And you can’t have it when you inevitably come back next turn, either. It’s not that I can’t afford it, though. In Troy’s economy it’s possible to be producing enough food by Turn 50 to easily trade for whatever else you need. The flexibility of the barter system, which replaces money with other resources like wood, stone, and bronze, is great in theory; especially with the stronger infantry requiring relatively scarce bronze to train and upkeep, I can see what the designers were going for. But as the game goes on, scarcity decreases to the point that everyone can have everything they want, more or less. And having practically infinite resources takes a lot of the tension and decision-making out of the strategy layer.    Siege battles are a bit less enjoyable. Most of the time, the only siege weapons you’ll have access to until much later on are battering rams, so you can’t punch a hole in the walls without actual divine intervention. Scaling the walls with ladders can be borderline suicidal, inflicting hugely disproportionate casualties on the attackers even when using high quality assault troops. If you have the luxury of time, it’s almost always better to surround a city and wait for them to starve themselves into submission. This is accurate for the era, but it can also take away from the drama and momentum of a campaign as your conquests turn into waiting games.  Troy’s battles also suffer early on from an issue that’s also prevalent in Three Kingdoms: Low-tier units are simply too easy to rout. Until you have the buildings and the bronze to start hiring higher-tier line troops, a lot of battles can feel like more of a joust than anything. One side will simply crumble before you really have any time to maneuver. I find these kinds of engagements very chaotic and unsatisfying, and it had me wishing for a game setting to tweak the base unit morale or make the overall battle tempo to be a bit less hectic. Mods usually come along to fix stuff like this eventually, but that’s not a great excuse for the developers to ignore it. It may not be up to the grandeur of Three Kingdoms or Warhammer 2, but A Total War Saga: Troy is a significant step up from the previous Saga game, Thrones of Britannia. Troy is simply dripping with style and offers exciting, diverse campaign objectives that enthusiastically retell the timeless tale of the Trojan War and its iconic characters. There are enough technical missteps, particularly with the campaign, economy, and battle AI, that it’s still vulnerable to a sharp jab in the heel. But with a bit of post-launch love to clean all of that up, it could certainly take its place among the Total War pantheon. "
338,Fast &amp; Furious Crossroads ,4.0,"If ever there was a film franchise perfectly positioned for a modern video game adaptation, it’s Fast &amp; Furious. For a medium so regularly adept at putting us in high-speed pursuits and shoving us through sweeping action sequences, it’s almost baffling that in nearly two decades this series has never spawned a truly top-notch, dedicated tie-in (at least beyond 2015’s small but free Fast &amp; Furious-themed spin-off experience for Forza Horizon 2). Unfortunately, it still hasn’t. Fast &amp; Furious Crossroads is short, shallow, and surprisingly simple, and it’s nothing less than a crashing disappointment in virtually every department.  The Fast &amp; Furious film saga’s rise from low-fi Point Break rehash to six-billion-dollar box office brute is the bane of film snobs, but I love it. A high-octane hodgepodge of spy movie madness and telenovela tropes, these films may be dumber than a box of hair but they have oodles of heart – and I am unironically and unequivocally invested in them. I’ve got all the Blu-rays; I’ve got way more of the Hot Wheels than my wife knows about. I assure you; I am all in. I’m telling you this because I need you to know I’m not punching down here. In fact, I was nearly punching the air when Crossroads was finally confirmed after years of rumours. A Fast &amp; Furious game from the talented team behind Need for Speed Shift and Project CARS, and Vin Diesel is involved? On paper that’s a supremely promising combo. But somehow all of that promise resulted in this bland and bafflingly basic game that barely lasts four hours – and that’s including the cutscenes. Not that I especially wanted to keep playing longer than that.  Things don’t get off to a particularly promising start, though, and with the opening mission dropping you directly into the action without any introduction, the overly-manufactured VO here between franchise stalwarts Dom and Letty feels like a jury-rigged solution for Kurt Russell’s Mr. Nobody being off the table for a proper intro. It’s like walking into a movie 10 minutes late. Crossroads quickly pivots to a trio of fresh faces – two ex-Miami street racers and an off-brand Spanish Liam Hemsworth – but despite their efforts, Sonequa Martin-Green and Asia Kate-Dillon’s Vienna and Cam aren’t very compelling characters. Martin-Green’s Vienna is largely written as a slightly crankier Letty and her sliver of backstory is basically left to the campaign’s closing lines of dialogue. Kate-Dillon seems to be having fun chewing the scenery as the non-binary Cam – who fits snugly in the Fast universe, which has been quietly and effortlessly nailing diverse ensembles for nearly 20 years – but they're not given any particularly funny material. It was a welcome respite when Tyrese Gibson’s Roman finally showed up to inject some mild comic relief into proceedings. Alas, the game itself is no deeper than the new characters.  Crossroads may look like a Need for Speed-style experience spiked with a hefty dose of official Fast &amp; Furious features but it’s really nothing of the sort. There are no open worlds to explore and almost no actual racing to speak of. The single-player campaign is rather a scripted series of completely linear segments of action-driving, so to speak. As such, Crossroads has more in common with, say, SpyHunter than any Need for Speed – or, at least, those obligatory car missions in old James Bond shooters.   There are a pair of chapters towards the end that are more dynamic and fleshed-out – the quarry mission pumps up the amount of environmental hazards and the last mission pleasingly dials up the scale of the task at hand to proportions even the film franchise might balk at – but then it’s over. There’s really no reason to go back; the missions play the same way every time. Icons for smashables and jumps throughout each mission seem to hint at some kind of Stuntman-inspired scoring system for encouraging cinematic driving that never materialises. Hit the crates or don’t; Crossroads doesn’t seem to care. Outside of the brief campaign there’s online multiplayer, dubbed Online Ops. These appear to be a nine-player contest between three teams of three – heroes, villains, and cops. However, I can’t say how it works because I can’t start a match; any time I try I appear to be the only person in the world playing it. It’s a problem that so many cars and unlockables are tied to ranking up in Online Ops when I can’t actually play them. With the petrolhead pedigree of Slightly Mad Studios, I expected far, far better of Fast &amp; Furious Crossroads. There are certainly glimpses of a game that respects the film franchise as much as fans do, with a well-curated vehicle roster, some familiar sequences that riff on the some of the most memorable moments from the movies, and the occasional cheeky wink at the audience, but overall Fast &amp; Furious Crossroads is a short and superficial relic of a previous generation. "
339,Grounded Early Access ,9.0, When we first saw Grounded less than a year ago, the pitch was to adapt Obsidian’s signature RPG style into the survival genre. Having recently launched into Early Access on Steam and Xbox Game Preview (plus Game Pass), it’s currently much more of what you’d traditionally expect from the latter than it is influenced by the former. But what’s here so far is entertaining enough and, despite a few stumbles, clearly has a lot of room to grow. While Obsidian had previously said Grounded would incorporate strong story and RPG elements alongside the survival aspect, and while you can see hints of that, there’s not much to speak of yet. With no ongoing story beyond some collectible audio logs – I hit an “End of Story Content” message after less than an hour – it’s the “Honey I Shrunk the Kids”-style setting that’s currently doing most of the heavy lifting.   While it surely plays a little fast-and-loose with the relative sizes of certain objects and creatures, Grounded’s mega-sized take on a suburban backyard is fascinating to explore. From puddles turned into lakes to twisting branches under a garden hedge that more resemble the framework for an elven or Ewok village than “that place you quietly stuffed your beer can because you were too lazy to throw it out,” I was always intrigued to discover a new landmark or Easter egg that helped flesh out the world and my role in it. This is due in no small part to the fact that Grounded looks great. The miniaturized world you inhabit is rich and verdant, and it benefits heavily from some especially gorgeous lighting effects (although some of the depth-of-field effects lose their luster when you emerge from beneath the canopies of mushrooms and clover and realize the kid you’re playing as must just be incredibly nearsighted). Sunlight filtering through the branches of a tree in the early morning or bouncing through the chitinous exoskeleton of an ant the size of a German Shepherd were constant reminders to stop and savor the beauty of the environment, and the way moonbeams pierce through the light fog that blankets grass-blade forests (coupled with some truly great sound design) added a ton of eerie atmosphere to nighttime exploration.  “Eerie” might not be the right word, though. “Terrifying” is probably more accurate, because Grounded is, at times, just as much a survival horror game as it is anything else. And it’s not just the 12-foot-tall spiders, either – though they’re far and away the big winner of the “scariest thing in the yard” award, even with the much-discussed Arachnophobia slider turned all the way up (WHO THOUGHT LEAVING THE EYES ON THEM WAS A GOOD IDEA?!). There are also plenty of other mini monstrosities out to get you, from other large bugs like acid-spraying bombardier beetles to the tiny mites that spring towards you from the ground like furious, fuzzy versions of Half-Life’s headcrabs. Exploring at night and running into a pack of pincered larvae or spelunking into an old anthill just to run into the spider who’d made its nest there provided some hair-raising scares and instilled a sense of tension that carried over into every step I took. There isn’t much variety in terms of weather, though. I’ve been running around for more than two in-game weeks and every day has been warm and sunny and every night mild with light fog around 3 am. It would have been interesting to experience a rainstorm at this size, or see Obsidian work in some of the other tropes of the “tiny-sized person” experience – though maybe “The Attack of the Kaiju-Sized Toddler” update is still to come. The sound of a car stereo blaring as it rounded a nearby corner or a jet engine passing overhead were some nice touches that remind players they’re still in the modern world, but it would have been cool to have some more dynamic threats that weren’t just the indigenous backyard wildlife. Of course, that doesn’t make those insects any less deadly. To not end up just another bug snack, you’ll need to make use of your superior human intellect and do what we do best: destroy the world around you with zero consideration for its delicate ecosystem and use what’s left to build cool stuff. A robust and interconnected crafting system is the hallmark of a solid survival game, and Grounded’s early-access offering definitely has a lot for players who enjoy the endless grind of harvesting materials to convert into other materials that you can then turn into a house, or a trampoline, or armor made from the carcasses of defeated enemies. Where Grounded stumbles hardest is that this process has trouble remaining continually enjoyable. It’s certainly satisfying to tear off the final piece of an ant you needed to complete your armor set, but the battles required to get all those ingredients stopped being particularly fun after I killed my fifth ant. Combat essentially boils down to circling around an enemy while it attacks, then darting in to chop, stab, or club away some of its HP and repeat. Sure, there’s a parry system that can help boost your chance to stun a creature, but even then your armor still takes damage so it was almost always more efficient to just keep strafing. Of course, you can always just climb up on a rock and fire an endless barrage of arrows at an enemy, too (though be prepared to bring a lot of arrows – I once trapped a wolf spider and unloaded 50+ arrows into in, only to knock off about 45% of its HP). Hostile AI seems to have little-to-no sense of self-preservation, which, while true to their insect brains, made all but the most stressful of battles a fairly boring affair. I also lost count of the number of times I made mental notes to use the “Submit Feedback” button when crafting new items or building up my base. It seems crazy that a game so heavily focused on crafting in 2020 wouldn’t have the foresight to feature a ‘Craft Max’ button, the ability to craft at a workbench using items from nearby storage bins, or an auto-craft function that automatically consumes the raw resources required to create something. Similarly, I realize inventory management is a key part of any good survival game, but it felt a little odd not to be able to craft more mobile storage, or at least build items that would let me create stacks of previously un-stackable items (like a sling to bundle spears together, for instance). Between the tools needed for harvesting and the weapons/armor needed for self-defense, it felt like my inventory was always at least half-full before I even left home base. None of these things are particularly awful, but it felt like a lot of minor inconveniences that added up to a decent amount of frustration. Adding friends to the mix doesn’t lighten the load, either. Since one player has to serve as the host, that means anyone joining their game will be starting from absolute zero every time. Progress doesn’t transfer back to your game world, either [clarification: it didn’t work in our experience, which was cross-platform between Xbox and PC] meaning if you want to have a consistent experience with friends you either have to be the group’s permanent host, or be totally fine doing all your building in someone else’s save file for the entirety of your game (and even then you’ll need to make sure you leave all of your gear in one of their storage bins before logging out). On top of all that, Grounded is – please forgive the pun – pretty buggy. There’s nothing that I would consider particularly game-breaking (though I did experience a couple of hard crashes on my 2015 Xbox One that caused some minor progress loss) but I ran into some pretty noticeable jank throughout my time with it. Bugs – particularly larger ones like spiders or ladybugs – often get stuck in, on, or against geometry, if you’re hunting a bug and it gets too far away after taking damage, its HP will often fully reset, and placing foundational elements of my bases (walls, stairs, etc.) often came down to me having to actively glitch the system to get them where I wanted them. Grounded is a zany, challenging, and memorable adventure that benefits from Obsidian’s instantly recognizable style, humor, and RPG bonafides, making it one of the best survival games in years. There aren’t many games that I’ve been anxious to dive back into after playing for over 100 hours, but Grounded still has me daydreaming about my next tiny expedition. Even the obnoxiously small inventory space, occasional lost treasures, and continued wonkiness and stability issues  haven’t come close to throwing a wet blanket over an otherwise fantastic experience. It’s a testament then to how incredibly strong every other part of Grounded is that these issues did very little to cramp my style or my immense enjoyment. "
340,Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout ,8.0,"Fortnite and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds may have popularised the last player standing format, but Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout has truly unlocked its potential by painting it hot pink and putting it in a hot dog costume. Mediatonic’s family-friendly formula is a colourful, bouncy breath of fresh air that takes a different, less explosive approach to battle royales without losing any of the tension. Instead of C4, it’s Vitamin C you’ll be steering clear of as you’re bombarded with monstrously overgrown oranges in just one of its two dozen game show-like events. The vast majority of these minigames hit the mark, offering fun and frustration in equal amounts. Couple them with a vibrant aesthetic and a brain-tunneling soundtrack and Fall Guys manages to make you want to punch the air when you’re winning and scream at your screen when you’re losing, but you’ll be laughing either way. The concept of Fall Guys will be familiar to those that have seen game shows such as Wipeout or Takeshi’s Castle. Guide your very own customized jelly bean avatar through up to five rounds of inflatable carnage and you’ll have a shot at taking home the crown. Each match is framed as an episode and lasts around 15 minutes at most, which further drives home that TV show feel. The controls are simple with running, jumping, diving, and grabbing as your only tools to navigate obstacle courses, avoid enemies, or cling on for dear life in more survival-centered events that threaten to plunge you into the slimy depths. If you do happen to get eliminated then you have the option to watch those remaining battle it out for the title while the musical equivalent of glycerin is poured into your ears.  A game show is only as good as its games though, and this is where Fall Guys’ current pool of 24 largely triumphs. The obstacle course-style races are where I’ve found the most enjoyment, especially as it gets down to the wire as beans bounce off one another and desperately lunge for the finish line trying to make the cut. I’ve been particularly enjoying the havoc of Hit Parade and the precarious spinning platforms of The Whirlygig, which often descend into chaos as twenty too many characters try to fit through a small gaps or all jump for the same narrow platform. There’s always more than one path to take, some offering a high risk-reward option, which is welcome as it never feels like you’re completely out of a race despite being near the back of the pack. In Door Dash you hurtle towards the bottom of a track attempting to dive through doors, some of which will blast open, whereas others will stay firmly shut. There’s a simple pleasure found in walking through an opening as the opponent next to you slams face first into a brick wall.   But games that rely on silly physics can often take as much as they give, as seen in See Saw, which varies from the other races in that it can become incredibly frustrating almost instantly. The whole course consists of multiple enormous seesaws, funnily enough, and largely relies on your fellow competitors understanding how these playground apparatus made for toddlers work. It’s baffling how very few of them appear to, as you’ll find yourself sliding off their hopelessly titled platforms again and again due to, you know, basic physics. Then there’s Slime Climb, which is notably more difficult than most and served as my nemesis for many of my early hours playing Fall Guys. It’s a real sorter of the wheat from the chaff as slime slowly rises and you battle the clock, your opponents, and a mountain of obstacles. While most events usually cull Fall Guys’ initial pool of 60 players by about a quarter to half each time, it wasn’t uncommon for only a handful of players to be left after this event. But there is nuance to master here, and I soon found myself able to succeed where I once so often failed, now able to consistently conquer the climb and no longer audibly groaning when it appears in the rotation. That said, there are no offline modes in Fall Guys currently, so that mastery only came out of a lot of online losses. There’s no practice area to get to grips with the two dozen events, but more crucially there isn’t any scope for local co-op. It feels a bit of a miss to not have the option to play split-screen or against the AI in your own private matches. Most of the fun I’ve had with Fall Guys has been when playing with friends, whether that be cheering them on once I’ve already been eliminated or laughing at them as they get hurled into the abyss thanks to a 20-foot long banana. What’s a party game without a healthy dose of schadenfreude, after all?       Another reason for this being so desirable is that while most events are highly enjoyable, some Fall Guys rounds, well, fall flat. These include Perfect Match, an all too simple memory game that results in very few eliminations and – most criminally of all – is just a bit boring when compared with the mayhem found elsewhere.   Any of the rounds that include the ‘tail tag’ mechanic can become an exasperating affair. At their core, they require you to chase opponents around an arena and grab their tails from them. This can often become an exercise in futility, however, as the grab mechanic often doesn’t latch on to them unless you’re very close, and getting very close is a challenge due to the fact that you are moving at the same speed as the tail’s current owner. It’s disappointing that this mechanic is recycled in three separate games, especially when one of those is among the three ‘finals’ events meant to be the climactic end to a match. It can really take the wind out of my sails to see Royal Fumble as the crowning event after fighting hard to get there.     Thankfully any frustrations are soon forgotten if you manage to get that all important crown at the end. Whether that be quite literally grabbing it at the summit of the frantic race finale Fall Mountain or being the last left standing on the disintegrating geometry of the surprisingly strategic Hex-a-Gone. There’s a distinct sense of accomplishment and pure joy that the best battle royale games give you when grabbing a victory, and that feeling is the clearest sign yet that Mediatonic has got it right with Fall Guys.  A collection of exciting minigames and a smattering of every colour under the rainbow makes Fall Guys a consistent delight, even if it can also be a frustrating one at times. A few quality of life annoyances aside, it sets itself apart from both the party and battle royale games that inspired it in its own ludicrously fun way. I may only have a handful of crowns to my name so far and can’t wait to get hold of more, but most importantly I’m looking forward to the excitement, yells, and laughs I’ll have on my way to them. Joining the frosty, war-torn Verdansk and the wild, looming cliffs of King’s Canyon is an ocean of pink slime that stretches as far as the eye can see. I know where I’d rather be. "
341,Skater XL ,5.0,"Unlike the Birdman’s games – or the one with actual birds in it – Skater XL is a serious and mostly authentic and grounded simulation of skateboarding and it innovates in a truly engrossing way with its nuanced and tricky two-stick control system. There have been times over the last several days when I’ve become deeply immersed in the process of learning a new trick and executing it perfectly on a cool line I’d found some place within the maps. However, playing on Xbox has exposed the fondly-regarded PC version’s secret: it’s heavily reliant on user-made mods to flesh it out. This has left the console version feeling extremely light on content at launch and, combined with some regularly occurring jankiness, the result is something that generally feels more like a tech demo than a complete game.  Skater XL’s controls may initially seem familiar to Skate’s gesture-based brand of analogue stick flicking – and it’s true that there are some rough similarities – but mastering Skater XL’s controls is actually like learning a whole new language. In Skater XL, each thumbstick represents the skater’s corresponding foot. That may sound simple but sometimes it’s a bit like rubbing your belly with one hand while… braiding your own hair with the other. Even a straightforward kickflip requires you to pop the board with your back foot and then execute a properly-timed kick with your front foot. If you chuck a rotation in there, that’ll require one of the triggers. If you want to throw a grab on top of it all, that brings in the bumpers – and all of a sudden you’re squeezing your controller from all angles like it owes you money.   But I made a few more attempts, and those few attempts turned into a few more attempts, and a few more attempts after that. Eventually I landed one. Then three in a row. Then 10 in a row. Skater XL’s controls are a bit of a wall to crash through compared to, say, an arcade skate experience like any Tony Hawk game out there, but because they ask you to practise and practise, there’s a quaint loop here that imitates the spirit of the real thing – or, at least, learning a real, physical skill – in a satisfying way. Try. Fail. Try again. Fail again. Try again, succeed, celebrate.  The high school level feels very authentic, there’s a faithful rendition of the West L.A. Courthouse spot, and the downtown L.A. map also features riffs on several iconic spots skaters will likely recognise, but they’re all completely lifeless. No NPC skaters, no moving vehicles, no multiplayer; just you. The visuals and bright and sharp and the menus are clean and unobtrusive, but the visual quality is a little uneven overall. There’s some great detail on some of the surfaces, in particular – like the benches and pillars of the West L.A. Courthouse spot bearing the scrapes and scars of a few thousand 50-50s – but certain things don’t quite stand up to the same level of scrutiny (like shirts clipping through pants or the fuzziness on props like cars). The Big Ramp level is fun in bursts, but there’s no denying that it undermines Skater XL’s focus on making you strive hard to perfect the fundamentals of straight street skating when I can bust out a successful backside 1800 into… a port-a-loo, by accident. There’s big rift between the gritty, harder-than-it-looks urban skating Skater XL wants to celebrate and the fact you can successfully land a double-900 from low orbit on flat ground without your ankles exploding, and then… skate off through the desert. It just doesn’t feel finished. There’s a halfpipe on the Big Ramp for transition skating, too, but it's unreliable and I find whenever I get into a groove I end up exiting the pipe or landing on the coping unintended and bailing. The bails aren’t particularly great, either; if skaters aren’t freezing their limbs in odd positions they’re regularly clipping through the environment. They can be hard to predict, too; sometimes you’ll pop off the same low rail half-a-dozen times and collapse in an unexplained heap all but once, and other times you can accidentally fall from a freeway bridge and skate away with no hassles. The audio is very good, however, and there’s a nice suite of honest skating sound effects. With the short soundtrack turned off there’s an almost meditative quality to the hiss of rolling wheels and scraping ply. Skater XL is being positioned as a platform but on console it still feels a bit too much like a prototype. Regular glimpses of promise appear when I operate within its limits and focus on managing its complex controls and limit myself to earnest, realistic skateboarding, but ultimately it seems more like a skateboarding video tool than a fleshed-out game. It’s faithfully dedicated to skating’s Californian roots and – like real skating – it can look pretty slick when you edit out the misses, but with all its rough edges and without the PC’s huge mod environment, I’d anticipate only serious skateboarders will stay on board here. "
342,Hellpoint ,6.0, If you were to create a checklist of what makes a game a Souls-like, meaning it follows in the footsteps of FromSoftware’s massively popular Dark Souls series, you’d get bullet points that look nearly identical to Hellpoint: respawn checkpoints in a labyrinthine world, the loss of all currency on death unless you can retrieve it, slow and methodical combat with light and heavy attacks, as well as challenging encounters punctuated by enormous boss monsters. It’s all here, for better and for worse, but its elaborate sci-fi setting gives it some character of its own and a strong combat system made suffering through the extensive bugs largely worthwhile.   Visually, Hellpoint is quite stunning. When I’d exit a walkway and emerge onto a terrace that overlooks a sea of stars and spiraling colors I’d legitimately just stop and stare for a few minutes. Interiors are similarly stylized with bright, popping colors that contrast the dark and decrepit tone incredibly well. At one moment you could be exploring a nearly pitch-black hallway with enemies lurching at you from around corners and then it’ll feel like you’re walking across the bifrost to Asgard. And yet, despite the dramatic swings in color palettes and lighting, it all feels consistent and cohesive. A lot of love and care clearly went into the world building from a design perspective and it makes me immensely curious to see and learn more – which underscores the lack of a real story, as a side effect.   Checkpoints (called Breaches) are scattered everywhere, but you’ve got to use an extremely rare “synchronization” item to open them up for teleportation between one another, so planning out which ones you want to use for fast travel is key. However, it’s basically impossible to do that intelligently without a map for planning. The result is that the fast travel system can’t be relied upon, so I was usually desperately hoping to find a shortcut connecting back to previous regions or just running back through entire zones to retrace my steps.  Overall, though, I like the way Breaches work more than campfires in Dark Souls because not only do they heal you, but they do not respawn enemies. (Instead, enemies automatically respawn after a certain amount of time.) Because of that, backtracking was usually not as frustrating as in other Souls-likes since I didn’t have to kill the same enemies over and over as much. Breaches also don’t refill your healing item – instead, you recharge that (and your Energy resource) over time by landing melee attacks. It’s a good balance and incentivizes fighting aggressively if you’re close enough to a Breach to just run back and heal really quickly.   Combat in Hellpoint is its strongest aspect, but not for the reasons I expected. Moment-to-moment gameplay felt floaty and a bit wonky at first, like the awkward jump mechanic that makes timing leaps across death pits difficult to control – especially compared to the weighty precision of Dark Souls. Even so, Hellpoint’s fluidity eventually grew on me. Dodging is extremely powerful here and happens super quickly, letting you immediately evade attacks and reposition. The biggest annoyance is that getting behind enemies is extremely difficult unless they’re lunging forward since they seem to use the same lock-on targeting you do. A huge part of what makes combat so satisfying is the progression system. Not only do you upgrade weapons at terminals to improve their overall stats and apply mods, but using the same weapon for a few hours will start to unlock special abilities. For example, one of my swords expands in length to do more damage, while my hand axe emits an ethereal glow that doubles as a thrown projectile. There’s a lot of weapon variety, from trusted one-handed melee items and shields to massive hunks of metal and spears, all the way to railguns. Yes, guns – it takes a while to find ranged weapons worth using and to get your stats high enough to fire them well, but they can be very powerful and change the pace of fights enormously. They all use your Energy meter for every shot – even the thrown weapons – so they likely won’t ever be your primary method of attack (since you need melee attacks to recharge Energy) but they’re useful for softening up a target before moving in for the kill.   A high level of difficulty is a big draw for Souls-like games but Hellpoint isn’t very consistent in that regard. Naturally, the first few zones are extremely deadly and challenging, in part because you’re still learning how combat works, but once things clicked I found the difficulty curve to be choppy and inconsistent, without a steady increase in difficulty. Some of the later boss fights I was able to handle on the first try after dying nearly a dozen times on some of the earlier ones. On the other hand, some non-boss enemies presented a real struggle even at late-game stages due to how frequently you face them and how relentless they can be in their attacks. It’s almost as if Hellpoint could sense my comfort and complacency so it’d come for me extra hard when I least expected it. I relish those fights, but they didn’t feel logically placed. Co-op works just like it does in Dark Souls, in that you place messages seeking help in the environment where other players can answer, though here those messages are indecipherable symbols and shapes, making them basically useless. You’re also subject to invasions by PvP attackers, or you can directly join a friend’s game using a unique code (or in local co-op). It’s fine, but there isn’t an understandable reason why these sorts of games can’t just have more stable and functional co-op that isn’t convoluted.   Beyond that, some of Hellpoint’s more interesting features are never really introduced or used in interesting ways. For example, one big idea that is woefully under-explained is the black hole the space station orbits. As it turns out, depending on its position relative to the station (as indicated by the clock-like thing in the top left corner of the screen) different things can happen. For example, sometimes it will cause more or more powerful enemies to spawn, and so on. It would’ve been nice to have some introduction to that concept so I could’ve planned around it, but at the same time the events weren’t a big enough deal that I needed to be aware of it to succeed. Much of what Hellpoint lacks in original Souls-like gameplay mechanics it makes up for with its stylish sci-fi aesthetic, creepy atmosphere, and relentless focus on making you uncomfortable. The frequent bugs are a major hindrance, though, and it’s far too derivative to step out of the shadow of the genre greats that came before, but it does provide some decent, old-fashioned video game punishment with satisfyingly brutal combat. "
343,Fantasy Strike ,8.0, One of the questions I’m sometimes asked by friends is what the best entry-level fighting game is for someone who is new to the genre, but who also doesn’t want to spend hours in a training mode or immediately get completely blown up when they play online. My answer is generally, “such a game doesn’t exist, but the closest you’ll get is probably Fantasy Strike.” Fantasy Strike is a fun, easy to play fighting game with simple controls, tight and strategic fighting mechanics, a well rounded cast of 12 unique fighters, and some wonderful innovations in the genre that I wish other, bigger franchises would take note of. Visually, it’s very bland and lacks its own unique personality, but if you look beyond that, you’ll find one of the most daringly different fighting games of the last decade – not to mention it’s free-to-play, has great netcode, and full crossplay support between PC, PS4, and Nintendo Switch.  Fantasy Strike throws the basic rules behind most fighting games out the window, instead writing its own with the goal of making things as intuitive and accessible as a traditional fighting game can possibly be. You can’t crouch, which eliminates all high/low mix-ups; the life bars are broken up into segmented chunks of HP, so you always have a clear idea of how many more hits are needed to win or lose; your super meter fills up automatically; there are no complicated input commands; you can counter throws by just standing completely still. The list goes on and on, resulting in a very distinct flavor of a familiar whole. Fantasy Strike uses a three button fighting system with each character largely sharing the same basic input commands for each of their moves. While on the ground, every character has three A attacks, one B, one C, and one super. While in the air they also have one attack for each button along with an aerial specific super as well. This makes it very easy to jump between and learn new characters, which is great because online ranked play requires you to create a three person team. Despite the similar movelists, these characters all play dramatically different from each other, even those within the same archetype. Jaina, for instance, is a zoner who can fill the field with projectiles, but can also be incredibly nasty up close with some very tricky cross ups and respectable damage. Argagarg on the other hand, despite also being a zoner, focuses on poisoning his opponent and utilizing his projectiles to push his adversaries away and keep the poison active. Every character in Fantasy Strike feels like they have something unbelievably powerful that only they can do, which makes the entire roster very fun to play and also satisfyingly challenging to play against. Even beyond the simplified inputs, one other area of accessibility that Fantasy Strike absolutely excels at is using visual cues to tell you everything you need to know about the properties of a move. You’ll never wonder why you got hit by something, or be confused as to how to counter a specific move. When enemies glow blue, they have armor; when they glow white, their attack is invulnerable; when they get you with a command grab, big bold letters appear that say “Jumpable,” letting you know that you could have jumped to avoid getting hit; when you see blue sparks after an attack is blocked, you have frame advantage; when you see red sparks after an attack is blocked, it’s punishable. It’s all incredibly intuitive, and the stuff that isn’t outright taught in its excellent intro tutorial is easy enough to pick up on with experience. There are so many design choices present to make things easy and accessible that you would think the depth of the gameplay would suffer as a result, but surprisingly, it doesn’t. Fantasy Strike successfully manages to lower the skill floor of all of its characters without ever dropping the skill ceiling, and it does so not only through excellent design of its movesets and character archetypes, but also by giving players the right tools to understand those movesets and archetypes. Embedded within Fantasy Strike are excellent spotlight videos for each character that go over everything one would need to know in order to be competent with that character. These videos are short, comprehensive, and most importantly, they’re presented in a way that makes it very easy to understand complex concepts like set-ups, cross ups, frame traps, and more. Within just an hour or so, I already felt comfortable enough with a character to jump online and start having competitive matches. After a few of those, I was on my way to winning my first ranked mini-tournament. These kinds of tutorial videos are absolutely something that should be standard among future fighting games. As good as all of this is, there’s no getting around Fantasy Strike’s bland style. Its roster, while very mechanically interesting, are among the most boring character designs I’ve played in a modern fighting game. Rook is just a stone golem with no distinguishing characteristics; Setsuki is a kunoichi with rainbow hair that feels randomly colored in with a paint bucket tool; and Grave is the prototypical Ryu-style character who just wants to improve and fight strong opponents, just to name a few. These boring looking fighters aren’t helped by a weak arcade mode that does very little to give them any much needed personality and is hampered by inconsistent voice acting throughout. Looks aren’t everything of course, but when the competition even among indie fighting games includes gorgeous options like Skullgirls, Under Night In-Birth, and Them’s Fightin’ Herds, Fantasy Strike’s isn’t even in the same league on the audio/visual side. For the solo players, in addition to arcade mode, there’s also a daily challenge mode, a standard survival mode, and an interesting twist on a Boss Rush mode that throws all concerns about character balance out the window by rewarding you for each victory with your choice of an incredibly overpowered perk after each fight. What’s great is that many of these power ups are specific to each character and designed to either cover their inherent weaknesses or ridiculously enhance their strengths. In one Boss Rush run, I had a Rook that could deal 6 damage off of a standard throw by just the third round, basically allowing him to one-hit KO a lower health enemy as soon as I got my hands on them. It’s an amusing distraction, but not one I felt the need to come back to after a few runs.  Fantasy Strike’s actually been around since 2017 as a Steam Early Access game, but as of July 21, 2020 it became completely free to play with the full roster of 12 characters available immediately. That’s unprecedented in a genre where other free-to-play games lock most of their characters behind some sort of pay wall, and it truly makes Fantasy Strike the best entry point for newcomers interested in fighting games. You won’t get access to the single-player modes like Arcade, Boss Rush, or Survival without paying at least $20 for the Core Version, but you’ll still be able to access Fantasy Strike’s full suite of training modes, and most importantly, you’ll be able to play online in both casual and competitive playlists. However, if you’re playing for free, you won't have access to local versus multiplayer, and you won’t be able to start a private room with another person unless at least one of you owns a paid for version, which is a humongous bummer even in spite of all that Fantasy Strike offers for free. Instead of charging for characters, developer Sirlin Games has introduced a very unusual subscription service called Fantasy+ that gives players access to special Master level costumes that can’t be purchased in the shop, XP boosts on all characters (which is just a show of how experienced you are with a character and opens up the Master costumes at level 20), and access to Replay Theater. Replay Theater is the star here, and it is actually a pretty fantastic innovation on how players are able to view recorded matches, and though it doesn’t quite justify a $5 per month premium fee, it is a great perk for those who want to show support for the developers who are offering a substantial amount of value by keeping the whole roster free to play. Many fighting games have the ability to rewatch your own matches and replays of high level matches, but with Replay Theater, you can actually filter what you want to see based upon the rank of the players and the specific characters used in the match. You can even set the filter so you can watch only matches of one specific character vs another, which is super helpful if you find yourself having trouble with a particular matchup and want to see how high level players deal with it.   The 500 gem skins are fairly significant overhauls of a character’s look. There’s one for Onimaru for instance that changes his look from being a generic samurai to a clearly Street Fighter inspired oni, while the 350 gem skins are mostly just recolors of the existing base skin. Overall it’s a fairly standard selection of cosmetics. $5 for a skin seems pretty pricey, however, especially considering most fighting games offer full characters as DLC for very close to the same price.  Fantasy Strike is a shining example of a fighting game that’s incredibly easy to play without sacrificing the mental chess and decision making that makes them so much fun. It’s very rough around the edges, with a roster of twelve characters that are much more interesting mechanically than they are visually, and a few interesting, though ultimately shallow single player modes. The inability to set up a private match with friends who are also playing for free is a tough pill to swallow, but its value as a free-to-play fighting game cannot be overstated. This truly is the best entry point for those who want to dip their feet into a traditionally difficult genre – and those who stick around will find it stands up as a great fighting game in its own right too.

344,Othercide ,9.0, Some parents are really invested in their kids’ report cards or success in extracurricular activities. Othercide offers a different kind of parental pride as you command a small army of warrior Daughters armed with giant swords and sleek revolvers they can use to slice, bash, and blast through a menagerie of Lovecraftian horrors. But this is more than an outlet for such dreams of blood-drenched parenthood, though. Othercide is also the best turn-based tactics game of the year so far. With the help of a mysterious figure called the Red Mother, Othercide puts you in charge of a darkly ethereal realm called the Inner Void from which you summon Daughters – echoes of whatever the Mother used to be – to stop the coming of an eldritch entity known as Suffering. Similar to 2018’s Into the Breach, this will require failing and going back in time over and over until you manage to get it right. Each successive “Remembrance” allows you to carry over a currency called Shards from your previous run, so I never felt like I was having to start from square one. Failure is an expected and essential part of progression.  Once I realized that death was never really the end, it could sometimes feel a bit too forgiving, though. Shards are used to activate unlocked bonuses on a per-run basis like increased health and damage, and even the ability to skip bosses you’ve already defeated. While there is a satisfying sense of progression, I usually earned so many shards per run that I didn’t have to make interesting decisions about how to spend them. I could activate all of the bonuses I’d unlocked at once.  Luckily, the other resources at my command did require me to make those difficult calls. Notably, Daughters do not heal between missions, and you won’t find any healing abilities or items. On top of taking damage, most of the more powerful special attacks cost health to use. The only way to heal a daughter is to sacrifice another one of equal or higher level. Having a supply of sacrifices is rarely an issue, as the Vitae needed to summon new daughters is handed out in abundance. But the emotional weight I felt destroying one of my children so that another may live could be potent. As a consolation, the beneficiary will carry a part of the sacrificed daughter with them always in the form of a small mechanical bonus based on her stats at the time of death. The final, and most precious, resource is resurrection tokens. Since each failed Remembrance sends your entire current roster to the cemetery, these function as a way to carry over some of your best fighters from one run to another. They’re very hard to come by over the course of a run, though spending shards can allow you to start with a few from the get-go. They allowed me to maintain some sense of continuity and build a deeper bond with Daughters who had been with me since the beginning, which I really appreciated. When the turn-based action kicks in, Othercide proves itself a satisfying, challenging, sometimes frantic tactical dreamscape. Each of the four classes has a distinct role to play, from the tanky Shieldbearer to the heavy-hitting Blademaster to the ranged support specialist, the Soulslinger. The enemy diversity is great, from quick and deadly Scavengers to hulking, insectoid abominations that can lock you in pace with a gooey discharge. New foes are introduced gradually across the five chapters, and even seeing familiar ones in new combinations often forced me to stop and think about how to handle the situation. A time-based initiative system throws further excitement and consideration into the mix. Daughters who use more than half of their action points will have to wait a lot longer to act again, so it’s often smarter to end your turn with at least half remaining so you can better react to the changing battlefield. And with three mission types – the tense Rescue, desperate Survival, and ass-kicking Hunt – I had to learn what works best in a variety of situations.  The one area where these missions felt a bit lacking was in the map selection. I saw the same layouts often enough for it to become a little repetitive, even if the horde of baddies was different every time. At least they’re nice to look at. Well, “nice” might not be exactly the right word. Othercide is bleak as hell, and its mostly black-and-white, gothic horror aesthetic does a great job creating an atmosphere of oppression and danger. The splashes of red the highly stylish Daughters bring enhances the feeling that they stand as emblems of hope in this doomed nightmare. I can’t wrap up without mentioning the bosses, which are each expertly-designed puzzles that often have multiple viable solutions, but will absolutely kick your ass back to the beginning if you go at them guns blazing. I wasn’t able to best any of the ones I came up against on a first try, but any enemy you’ve faced previously will be added to the codex where you can read up on its behavior. All of the enemies in Othercide behave deterministically; there’s no randomness involved, except in the dice rolls for things like attacking and dodging. So understanding that a specific boss or enemy will always go after the closest Daughter, or the one with the least health, can allow you to manipulate them and lead them into traps. I really hit my stride when I realized the power this knowledge could give me. Othercide is a tactical roguelike with a flair for the dramatic, satisfying combat that rewards careful planning and knowing your enemies, and difficult, sometimes heart-rending shepherding of your resources. I still haven’t made it to the final, semi-secret unlockable boss, since this journey gets what the kids would call “bastard hard” by the end. But even so, I’m really looking forward to finishing my business with them and uncovering the remaining secrets of the dark dream. Don’t sleep on Othercide. This is one for the musty, moldering books. "
345,Carrion ,7.0, For anyone who’s ever watched a monster movie and thought “Hey, it would be pretty cool to be that monster,” the premise of Carrion is immediately appealing. It’s a power fantasy that has you going an utter rampage through an underground facility, terrorizing both armed and unarmed inhabitants along the way. Developer Phobia Game Studio is uncompromising in its approach to making Carrion as true to this fantasy as possible, and it makes for a game unlike any I’ve played thanks to a collection of truly excellent moments. Even when the novelty of grabbing a helpless scientist and slamming them all around a room, Hulk-style, wore off, Carrion’s puzzles and cerebral combat encounters still kept me thoroughly entertained. The monotony that lurks between them, however, is the real monster. If there’s one thing that Carrion nails, it’s the movement and abilities of its leading amorphous, multi mouthed, tentacled monstrosity. The monster has total freedom of movement, with its appendages automatically shooting out and pulling it toward whatever direction you point it in. It’s delightfully creepy to watch and there’s a great speed and fluidity to its movements, which is important because hit-and-run tactics are crucial when dealing with the more dangerous weapon-wielding enemies you’ll encounter. You can control one of your tentacles via the right stick and grab either enemies or pieces of the environment with the right trigger. Enemies can be consumed for health and extra biomass, or slammed and tossed around like rag dolls; bits of the environment can be hurled across the room; and doors can be ripped right from their hinges. It’s hard not to crack a devilish smile when you’re able to creep down on an enemy from the ceiling, quickly pull them up, eat their top half, and drop their lower half down for the rest of the people in the room to freak out about.  As you progress through the underground facility, you’ll unlock strains of DNA that add new abilities to your repertoire, such cloaking, growing blades and charging through barricades, and most notably, parasitically controlling a human. In typical Metroidvania fashion, these abilities typically have both a combat use and a navigational use, and every time you get a new ability you’ll be able to explore previously closed-off sections of the map. The best Metroidvanias manage to hide worthwhile upgrades and secrets to encourage backtracking and exploration whenever you get a new ability. This is one pro tip Carrion doesn’t follow in that there are only nine mostly useless, optional upgrades. Worse still, searching for them is a nightmare because of how easy it is to get lost. There’s no map to consult, no reminder of your current objective, and no waypoint or hint system to guide you. At one point I backtracked to access a previously blocked off area, only to find that all it did was provide a useless shortcut. Then I found myself hopelessly lost in a cleaned-out facility for an absolutely miserable two or so hours of aimless wandering. On my second playthrough, I could see that there is a fairly cleanly laid-out path to follow to get from main objective to main objective, but any deviation from that path makes it very hard to find your way back because you don’t know what those main objectives are. Just to illustrate how much of an issue this was, my first blind playthrough took about six hours. My second took a little over two.  It’s worth repeating that the actual moment-to-moment gameplay of Carrion is excellent. There are some very cleverly laid-out encounters that offer a ton of freedom in terms of how you literally pick apart your prey, and while it’s pretty easy early on, in the later bits it ups the ante significantly with armored mechs, fast drones that can rip you to shreds, and flamethrower-wielding soldiers who will have you rushing to the nearest body of water if they manage to set you on fire. As far as the story goes, there isn’t much of one to speak of, but that actually works in Carrion’s favor. From the start until the end, the perspective never shifts away from the monster, outside of a couple of quick flashback sequences that provide some context for its origin. That makes it kind of a fun and unique way to experience the increasingly dire state of your human adversaries, as presented through emergency bulletins and LED signs. When there are soldiers to kill and helpless scientists to terrorize, Carrion absolutely lives up to the promise of its monstrous premise. It’s unrelenting in its pursuit of delivering that pure power fantasy of being an uncontrollable monstrosity making its escape from a locked-down facility, but in that pursuit, it leaves out fundamental tools that would have made exploration less of a slog. Carrion brings the fantasy of being the monster in a horror movie to life, but also makes you wonder how those monsters managed to make their way around without a map. "
346,Destroy All Humans! ,7.0, Whether it’s 2005 or 2020, there’s something cathartic about running amok in an idyllic 1950s world as an angry gray alien and slurping up human brains by the gallon. This upgraded remaster of the original Destroy All Humans! recaptures that simple joy, and does a respectable job of updating the look and feel. It was never a masterpiece of open-world third-person action, but it still knows how to have some fun.   All of the voice acting is straight out of the 2005 version, so we get the good with the bad. The main character, Crypto, still seems miscast – he sounds like some kind of weird alien hybrid of Jack Nicholson and Duke Nukem, and his lines usually aren’t very funny. On the other hand, you hear much more chatter from your alien overlord, who’s played by Invader Zim’s Richard Horvitz, and he’s always amusingly over the top as he screams orders at you. (“As I suspected: the humans are just elaborately evolved meat!”) And the main villain, the leader of the Men in Black-style organization Majestic, sounds like a sassier Kylo Ren.   Of course, enemy AI is extremely basic and the hordes of easily swatted bad (good?) guys spawn in all around you, so it’s a simple but fun style of action as you bounce around zapping 1950s-era police, soldiers, and G-men, tossing grenades and rockets back at them and blasting tanks. The controls feel snappy and most of the weapons are good fun to use – it’s hard to go wrong with a chain lightning gun, a plasma blaster that reduces victims to skeletons, and a grenade launcher. The anal probe is fairly useless, though – it’s all in service of a joke that’s instantly played out. All of it’s heavy on auto-aim so you basically just have to fire in the general direction of a target, which makes the new target lock feel pretty unnecessary. Success is much more about staying on the move than it is about precision accuracy. iframe allowautoplay="""" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/gallery/38363/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery38363"" scrolling=""no"">you have no control over your altitude and [Correction: you can control your altitude but it's not tied to the camera and aiming controls, which is the issue I had with it – you can only aim straight ahead] you can’t aim as far ahead as it seems like you should be able to, but it’s quite satisfying to be able to blow up nearly any building even though the explosion effect is kind of weird and blobby. There’s some skill involved in the more intense battles since you have to block incoming missiles with carefully timed shields, but it’s generally an even lighter type of combat than what you see on foot. Because of that it’s easy to forget to pump upgrade points into the saucer as opposed to Crypto’s personal abilities, but you’ll probably need both to get through the final boss.    What gives Destroy All Humans! a little more depth than meets the eye is that each mission has optional side objectives, such as scoring kills with explosives, reaching a goal undetected, or killing a target in a very specific way, which adds some good replayability. On top of that, all of the maps include gradually unlocked challenges like rampages, races, and abductions (where you have to toss people or things into a beam that sucks them up) and you can duck into those between missions to farm brain-cash for weapon upgrades. Between those side activities and the campaign missions, Destroy All Humans! kept me busy for about 15 hours – including grinding a bit to buff up my UFO to handle the final boss fights. Nearly all of the missions are effectively identical to the original game, though there’s one new mission chain in the Area 42 map in which you infiltrate and sabotage the Air Force’s attempt to make its own version of a flying saucer. It fits in well, to the point where I wouldn’t have known it was new if it hadn’t been pointed out, which is both good and bad. It’s a lot of very similar light stealth gameplay, which isn’t the strongest part of Destroy All Humans!, but the story contains some of the better moments in the entire campaign and there are some almost Hitman-like assassinations I’d have liked to have seen more of. Blasting through the bright and cheery 1950s world of Destroy All Humans! is a simple but satisfying kind of fun, and there’s a lot to be said for that. Just like the original, this remaster’s comedy is a little hit or miss but its attitude is in full force all the way through thanks to some overpowered alien abilities that let you mow down the puny human resistance like an overlord.

347,Orcs Must Die! 3 ,7.0,"After an unsuccessful detour into competitive multiplayer in Orcs Must Die! Unchained, the Stadia-exclusive Orcs Must Die! 3 is a return to the co-op action/tower defense gameplay that  made this series an old favorite of mine. I have to admit I was a little surprised at how literal that return is, though – so much of the selection of traps and menagerie of orcs is recycled from 2012’s OMD 2 that it feels like the kind of iterative sequel you’d get one year after the last game, rather than eight. And the one big new idea, the large-scale War Scenario maps, are too spread out to really play to the series’ strengths. It’s all still good meat-grinding fun, of course, but it’s very familiar. Orcs Must Die! 3’s story is the same goofy fantasy from the previous two games. The two new warmage characters’ banter has a couple of chuckle-worthy moments as the sassy one berates the oblivious one until they earn mutual respect as they discover they make a good team, but outside of that it’s pretty run-of-the-mill. The potentially interesting story ideas they hint at, like one of them being an especially gifted magic user, don’t actually go anywhere and play no part in resolving the conflict with a villain with all the character development of Megatron from the original Transformers cartoon. It’s fine, just superficial.  But as always, it’s immensely satisfying to assemble an efficient slaughterhouse by laying down a variety of different traps and racking up combo scores by bouncing your parade of victims from one to the next. Each of the 18 levels is a challenging puzzle to optimize the enemies’ path so that they trigger as many traps as possible. Once you’ve made them take the most inconvenient path possible with barricades (their route is helpfully visualized by ghost orcs during the planning phase), you litter the way with spike traps that impale them from below, shock traps that zap them from above, arrow traps that blast them with projectiles out of the walls, spring traps that launch them into pools of lava or literal meat grinders, saw blades that protrude from the floor, flaming coals they have to walk over, and more.   Anything that’s left standing you have to deal with yourself using the simple but effective third-person shooting and trinket spells. Honestly, the ice attack is tough to go without – being able to freeze one enemy or an entire group in their tracks is invaluable when you’re facing down a charging ogre (who annoyingly stuns you before he attacks) or making a last-second effort to stop a durable enemy from making it into your castle’s mystical end zone.  Each playable character, including those you unlock after completing the campaign, is distinguished by a special movement ability, but I haven’t found them especially useful. For example, Kelsey can hover for a few seconds, but… why is that good? You don’t get much advantage from attacking from above and you can’t jump high enough to avoid getting smacked around, so I’m not sure. Egan’s ground-pound is slightly better but still a weapon of last resort. Each character also has a weapon associated with them in the campaign – a shotgun for Kelsey and a bow for Egan – both with some pretty destructive alternate-fire abilities that consume mana. Kelsey’s proximity grenade launcher pulled my fat out of the fire on numerous occasions. That said, you can take any weapon you want if you’re willing to use up one of your inventory slots, which sacrifices space for traps, so the choice of which character to play as doesn’t feel tremendously important.     However, there were definitely things that popped up that wouldn’t have been an issue if I’d been playing Orcs Must Die! 3 on my PC. For example, the resolution has dropped below 4K for a few moments for no discernable reason. Also, every time I started it up I was always surprised that it took a full minute between pushing the play button and being able to actually play – given that we’re a few months away from new console hardware that promises the death of load times, that’s not a great look. If Stadia’s going to live up to the promise of being able to pick up a phone and play high-end games on a whim, Google is going to have to sort that part out. Finally, after spending roughly 25 hours playing at 4K, I was grateful that my internet plan does not have a bandwidth cap. At that resolution, Stadia says it can use up to 20GB an hour, which means I transferred half a terabyte of data to play a game that couldn’t be more than 25GB if it were installed locally. Even though the bandwidth is effectively free, that was always nagging at the back of my mind as I played.  All of the locations are some variation on a castle setting, but there’s a decent amount of colorful visual variety to it to keep it from getting stale. Even if it’s as simple as changing from rivers of lava to rivers of green acid slime or night to day, combined with the very different layouts of the maps it was enough to make each level feel at least somewhat distinctive. I do wish there were some variation to the rank-and-file orcs and ogres, though – when every heavy orc is identical, down to how they wear their armor, it makes things a little monotonous by the time you slaughter your 2,000th one.  The biggest disappointment is that it’s pretty much the same cast of villains as Orcs Must Die! 2. To be fair, it’s a reasonably diverse group of small, medium, heavy, and giant bad guys, including elementals that break into smaller versions of themselves when destroyed, archers who launch dynamite arrows, and gnoll hunters who come straight after you instead of going for the rift, so there’s no shortage of variety – it’s just that we’ve seen it all before. The main new threat is a race of purple orcs called Fire Fiends, but aside from their immunity to fire damage and vulnerability to ice they basically behave identically to their greenskin cousins. Those they did force me to diversify my trap builds a bit since I have a habit of relying heavily on fire traps and their damage-over-time, so they served that purpose at least.   Playing through solo, it felt like most War Scenarios are balanced toward two-player co-op, where one person could thin out the orcs’ numbers by manning a catapult and bombarding the orcs as they charge while the other mops up the survivors inside. But if it’s just you, you have to abandon the artillery and fall back to the interior pretty much as soon as the doors are breached. Partially for that reason, the difficulty across the 18 scenarios felt wildly inconsistent. I was able to get a “perfect” five-skull score on some maps with just a couple of attempts, while others I had to try a half-dozen times or more just to complete at all on standard difficulty, which inflated my play time to around 25 hours. But I haven’t yet unlocked every trap, so it’s nice that there are still things to work toward in the post game and on the endless mode maps that might help with those barely manageable hoards. Orcs Must Die! 3 is a respectable, if long-overdue followup to the excellent Orcs Must Die! 2, but it feels more like an expansion to the 2012 game than a true revival or sequel. It’s certainly worthwhile for the 18 new and challenging maps it comes with, but its selection of traps and enemies are overly familiar and the large-scale War Scenario levels don’t meaningfully expand on the great third-person action meets tower defense idea like you’d expect. "
348,Paper Mario: The Origami King ,7.0, With Paper Mario: The Origami King, developer Intelligent Systems has once again found a clever new angle from which to explore its spinoff papercraft universe, pitting Mario against an army of origami adversaries who are hell-bent on bringing him into their fold. It has also revamped the series’ gameplay, shifting combat away from single-use stickers and cards and replacing the classic flat combat plane with a circular arena. While there’s plenty of charm here, there isn’t much meat to the mechanics, leaving players without many meaningful choices to make. The Origami King gets off to a good start, introducing the folded fiend King Olly as its villain. It’s a change that frees up Bowser and his minions to play a much more zany role, and for Intelligent Systems to deliver a more intriguing Mario story in general. The overall structure is exactly what you’d expect, however. King Olly has swaddled Peach’s castle with streamers, turning it into a Christo-esque prison, and Mario must find the source of each streamer and undo them to rescue the princess.  Unlike the last couple of Paper Mario games, The Origami King has ditched the concept of individual levels in favour of one big overworld. This makes for a nice change, creating a better sense of continuity as you trek up into the mountains from Toad Town or ship out to sea. At the same time, your progression is still largely linear and signposted – you’ll only ever have access to one new destination at a time, and backtracking isn’t built into the design beyond the use of Toad Town as a hub. I don’t mind this as it helps maintain forward momentum and many of the destinations are quite large, ensuring there’s plenty to do, but it’s certainly not as open as it first appears.  The world puzzles are all self-contained too, which is actually a big improvement from Color Splash. There, the Thing cards you needed to make progress were hidden across the entire world, creating frustrating roadblocks. Here, you’re rewarded for being observant and logical, not for finding the right point-and-click adventure-style combination of random objects. Most puzzles are solved with a combination of jumping, hammering, and a handful of abilities that Mario’s companion – Olly’s sister Olivia – unlocks, such as accordion arms to pull or hit things that are out of reach, and folding herself into towering elemental allies to do things like raise the ground itself or refill a lake with water. Intelligent Systems ekes quite a lot out of mileage out of this streamlined moveset.  Exploring the world is a lot of fun, as the landscape is always changing, and The Origami King offers a steady stream of palate cleansing curveballs, like fighting a giant Pokey in the desert, steering your party through treacherous rapids or popping into a quiet cafe to debate which minions are the strongest over a cup of joe. Some of these are more fun than others, such as the Shy Guys Finish Last quiz show, which consists of a series of mini-games that are more schoolwork than anything else, but the constant variety is appreciated. You’re also generously rewarded for taking the time to check every location’s nooks and crannies, and to prod any element in the environment that seems a little out of place. This is a game brimming with secrets, and a great deal of The Origami King’s charm is wrapped up in the hundreds of Toads that Olly’s folded soldiers have scattered through the kingdom. These Toads can be almost anywhere – that butterfly? A Toad. That bonsai tree? A Toad. That scrunched-up ball of paper rocking back and forth trapped in a living hell? You’d better believe that’s a Toad. Hunting Toads is one of The Origami King’s most delightful distractions, particularly because the snippets of dialogue that ensue are almost always offbeat, charming, and oh so punny. It’s not hard to see why Intelligent Systems decided to pepper the world with these collectables: they’re a great illustration of the Paper Mario series’  effervescent, self-aware personality, which is easily its best attribute. The Toads serve as more than just comic relief. They’ll also come and watch you in battle, gradually filling the bleachers around the circular arena and allowing you to see your overall progress at a glance. The Toads in the stands can be called on by tossing out coins, and will help you by hitting enemies, tossing items, or repositioning foes. The system isn’t as multi-faceted as the audience mechanics in The Thousand-Year Door, in which you had to earn their help – and occasionally had to leap into the audience to sort out a rock-wielding enemy – but then, that criticism of relative simplicity and shallowness applies to every aspect of The Origami King’s gameplay. Every time combat begins, Mario now stands at the center of a circular grid. For each wave of enemies you have a set number of moves you can make – either rotating rings around him or sliding wedges in or out. The aim is to reposition all the enemies so that you can either headbop down a line of them or hammer a 2x2 array, as this boosts your damage. Incorporating more overt puzzles into battles is a novel idea, and as you play you’ll learn new strategies to manipulate enemies into position, but it just isn’t compelling enough to be the system that drives a more than 20-hour game. The stakes are low too. If you can’t see the solution and run out of time, well, the battle will simply take a little longer to play out. Your opponents in The Origami King don’t really pose a threat – they’re simply an inconvenience to move past. Compounding this, your toolkit to do so is super limited, with only minor differences separating the assortment of hammers and boots. Those are what you’ll attack with 95% of the time, so there are few meaningful decisions required in what to use when. If the enemies are in a line you use an attack that does damage down the line, whereas if they’re grouped in two lanes you use a hammer attack. It's not rocket science. It’s not entirely one-note: occasionally, an enemy type will come along that shakes a battle up a bit, such as ghosts that disappear before you start repositioning them, cut-out soldiers that are in a chain and need to be folded back into one figure, or Ninji that reveal themselves to be log decoys if you try and hit them with a hammer, dropping on you from above instead. I also really loved one section which took place during a big brawl, so the battlefield had a mix of folded soldiers and friendly minions. Distinct moments like these are few and far between, however, and for the most part the combat just isn’t that interesting. I was forced to defend only every so often, making the timing-based blocking less important than it has been in other Paper Mario games. Mario does also have access to a handful of items he can use in battle, but not only do these feel underwhelming in terms of power, they adhere to the same patterns as Mario’s boots and hammers when it comes to when you use them. A Fire Flower, for instance, scorches enemies down the line, while the Tail hits four enemies in – wait for it – exactly the same spread as a hammer. Only the POW block and the occasional option to use one of Olivia’s elemental attacks breaks this pattern. That said, Intelligent Systems does attempt something more involved with The Origami King’s boss battles, which turn the tables and put the boss at the centre of the arena instead of Mario. Here you must shift the panels to create a path for Mario to follow from the outer rim in, stopping by treasure chests, panels that turn on special abilities, and so on before ending on an attack icon. While these battles rely heavily on trial and error, they’re certainly more interesting than regular combat – and the cast is more memorable, too. Only a Paper Mario game can build a set of bosses around anthropomorphised papercraft tools like scissors and rubber bands.  Even with this variation on the formula, however, combat is still one of The Origami King’s weakest elements, and the fact that it’s not tied to any kind of experience-based progression system makes battles even more perfunctory. Mario does grow in strength over the course of the campaign, incidentally, but it’s a nebulous process that’s tied into finding hearts that increase his max health… and also his strength. Go figure.  The Origami King has several vestigial RPG elements like this. You can buy and equip accessories, for instance, but they either represent linear improvements to your capabilities in combat or are tied to things like finding secrets, getting discounts at shops, or using confetti (which gives you the ability to patch holes in the world – think the colourless spots in Color Splash). There are no real gameplay choices here either, and I always had enough coins to buy every accessory as soon as it became available without having to go out of my way to earn more. Similarly, The Origami King flirts with a party system but ultimately steers well clear of making you decide anything there, either. Instead, there are several times throughout the course of the story in which Olivia and Mario are joined by a companion, but they’re played almost strictly for story and dialogue purposes. The amnesiac Bob-omb, for instance, is entertaining company but has no abilities outside combat. And when he joins you for a fight he’s fully automated and mostly falls on his face. Literally. The second companion, Professor Toad, fares a little better: he can dig for hidden treasures as you explore the Scorching Sandpaper Desert, but he also is only with you for a short time. I can’t help but wonder what The Origami King might have been like if it had a supporting cast that also served more of a gameplay purpose. Even so, it’s clearly evident just how much love and attention has been lavished on this papercraft world. Standout locations like Shroom City take the series’ visual design to a whole new level, while its tactile aesthetic has cleverly been incorporated into puzzles and secrets throughout the entire campaign. There are so many small details to enjoy too, like the way Mario brushes himself off after taking a tumble, or the joyous expression on his face when you nail a line of jump attacks in battle. And in a broader sense, so much of what makes this game – and series – special is Intelligent Systems being comfortable taking hard lefts with a world we’re all so intimately familiar with. To give you a few examples, in this game Mario takes part in a multi-part stage production, characters break into song and dance many times, we get some genuinely funny insights into what life’s like for Bowser’s minions, and Mario cosplays as other iconic Nintendo characters. These moments are the main attractions – the sense that anything can happen, and the breezy, irreverent way in which characters deal with whatever gets thrown their way. The Origami King is a truly likeable game despite the shallowness of its new spin on gameplay. Its characters are winsome, its visual design is gorgeous, its world is fun to explore, and its storytelling is outside the box and playful. At the same time, however, it could be so much more. Combat is largely unfulfilling, and your journey as a whole lacks meaningful choices. For a series with RPG roots, that’s a real shame. "
349,Ghost of Tsushima ,9.0, Ever since Assassin’s Creed started leaping from ancient Jerusalem to renaissance Italy to colonial America and beyond, there has been a longstanding itch to see the open-world stealth-action series take on feudal Japan. Consider that itch sufficiently scratched with Ghost of Tsushima. Sucker Punch’s latest is an absolutely gorgeous adventure through one of history’s most strikingly beautiful landscapes, and that beauty is compounded by one of the best blade-to-blade combat systems the open-world action genre has seen. There are some stumbles when it comes to stealth, enemy AI, and a few general minor frustrations, but for just about every moment where Ghost of Tsushima falters, there are plenty more where it soars. Ghost of Tsushima is a fictional tale told with fictional characters, but it’s based on the very real invasion of Japan by the Mongol Empire in 1274 that began on the Island of Tsushima. You take control of Jin Sakai, capably acted by The Man in the High Castle’s Daisuke Tsuji, who starts off as a samurai before a disastrous battle against the invaders quickly teaches him that perhaps the honorable but restrictive ways of the samurai code might not be enough to deal with this new and existential threat.  Ghost of Tsushima revolves around this inner conflict as Jin’s formative teachings push up against his need to save his homeland at any cost, and though it takes a little while to really get going, it’s a compelling struggle. Even if Jin himself isn’t the most charismatic of protagonists, his foil, Khotun Khan, played by Glee’s Patrick Gallagher, has charisma in spades. He’s one of the most memorable game villains of recent memory thanks to his soft intensity that is oddly calming despite his terrifying intentions. He’s extremely cunning, always one step ahead, and his presence as the “Big Bad” is a large part of why Jin’s 40 to 50-hour quest for vengeance works so well. dir=""ltr""  Ghost of Tsushima’s combat is like a witches’ brew made with bits of the Batman Arkham series, the pre-Origins Assassin’s Creeds, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and the entire library of Kurosawa films. And, as witches’ brews tend to be, the result is magical. Like all great combat systems, it’s simple to understand on a surface level: there are light attacks to quickly deal damage and beat out slower strikes, heavy attacks that deal more damage and can break through enemy guards, a block button to guard against certain attacks, and a dodge button to avoid the attacks that can’t be guarded. That probably all sounds familiar, but the glue that holds this combat system together and allows it to remain interesting the whole way through is the addition of the stances you can shift between at the push of a button. As Jin completes certain tasks, he’ll unlock new sword stances that each come with their own movesets, and, more importantly, their own strengths versus a particular type of weapon. The starting Stone Stance is ideal for dealing with swordsmen, as one charged-up stab attack can sneak through their guard and either kill them outright or deal massive damage. Later on you’ll learn the Water Stance, which uses slower but more powerful strikes that can break through the defenses of shield-wielding enemies. There are four stances total, and once you have access to them all combat will challenge you to not only identify the greatest threat at any given moment but also to swap to the stance that is best suited to deal with them, all while balancing the very real need to play defensively. When it’s at its best, combat in Ghost of Tsushima is fast, chaotic, tactical, and is true to the fantasy of being a lone hyper-skilled but outnumbered samurai. The little touches go a long way toward combat’s exquisite feel, in addition to bringing a bit of visual spectacle. The on-screen HUD is minimalist and the camera always stays really tight so you can get an up-close view of the action; enemies have clear audio tells so that even if you can’t see them you know when to dodge or block; fatal attacks often end with Jin spinning around to face the camera while your enemy stumbles around with blood spurting out before finally keeling over. Even smaller still, defeated enemies will sometimes crawl helplessly on the ground desperately trying to escape you, you can wipe the blood off your sword, you can bow to pay respect to your opponent, and the list goes on and on. The best part, though, is that there’s no traditional level-based stat progression. When you get stronger in Ghost of Tsushima, it’s not because invisible numbers went up and now you deal more damage and take less when you’re hit; it’s because your techniques got better and now you have new, better ways of dealing with tougher enemies. It’s so incredibly satisfying. When you level up you might spend a point to unlock the ability to block a previously unblockable attack from spear-wielding enemies, or you could choose the ability to block arrows so you can better deal with situations where you’re surrounded by archers. Or maybe you’ll unlock the ability to make enemies flee in terror when you execute a perfectly timed Sekiro-esque parry. It’s fantastic because it means that you’ll never run into an area in Ghost of Tsushima where, all of the sudden, you’re getting one-hit killed by archers who you’d previously brushed off, or having to spend a week chopping away at the sword equivalent of a bullet sponge just because they’re arbitrarily several levels higher than you. Crucially, this removes the problem of being forced to grind sidequests in order to reach a certain level minimum in order to progress in the story, which is something that certain other games are notorious for. Impressively, Ghosts of Tsushima’s difficulty always managed to be appropriate no matter what point of the campaign I was at. Enemies do get tougher, and you do need to improve your gear by upgrading your sword, armor, and charms to meet the difficulty curve, but the stat improvements from gear always felt secondary to the skills that you’d accumulate, but and the challenge always felt fair. Even when I bumped the difficulty up to hard mode, which makes enemies more aggressive, it never took away from the lethality of my sword. On top of all of this, there are also the various tools and gadgets that you earn over the course of your adventure. As Jin gets more and more comfortable with bending his samurai code and using tools outside of his normal repertoire, his combat abilities also expand dramatically. He can use kunai much like Batman uses his batarangs to quickly interrupt or eliminate weakened enemies; he can throw sticky bombs to disorient a large crowd; or he can take out his trusty bow and land a headshot to bring down a heavily armored foe in one hitpotentially end the fight before it even begins. The sheer variety of ways to approach combat in Ghost of Tsushima is incredible.  It’s a good thing that the blade-to-blade combat in Ghost of Tsushima is so good, because Jin’s ninja-inspired stealth does not hold up its end of the bargain. It works, on a very basic level, in all the ways that you’d expect it to: you can crouch-walk through fields of tall grass to invisibly sneak around enemy encampments, you can assassinate foes from above, and you can even buy upgrades that let you take out multiple enemies at once if they’re all foolishly clumped together. The problem is what happens once you get spotted. Enemies just don’t know how to handle it. What if you climb onto a rooftop? They don’t follow you, they don’t hunt you, they kind of just yell and throw shurikens. What if you suddenly break line of sight and crouch into a nearby flower patch that they can still clearly see? They just turn around, look elsewhere for a bit, and then blow their little alarm horns. It’s as if you do anything other than just fight once you break stealth, the AI just throws up its hands and shrugs. Jin’s stealth tools are also very rudimentary and don’t allow you any sort of creativity that might make stealth a little more exciting. They all kind of do the same things, just with different ammo types. There’s a wind chime that works as a distraction on a single enemy and a firecracker that works as a distraction for a group of enemies. Then there’s your bow that silently kills enemies, your longbow that silently kills helmet-wearing enemies, a dart that silently kills enemies and makes them puke blood, and another dart that makes enemies try to kill each other. There are also a handful of mandatory stealth segments which just boil down to finding the clearly laid out stealth route and occasionally using distractions to clear enemies out of the way. None of the flexibility and versatility of the melee combat is found in the stealth gameplay. Of course, there is a risk involved with stand-offs: they’re absolutely devastating if you lose. Your health is drained almost nothing and you’re put in a position where you’re surrounded by all of the still very much alive enemies in the area. That risk gets greater later on as enemies start throwing in feints to try to make you swing early. It’s an all-around fantastic mechanic that not only fits with the samurai theme, but also takes the fun but typically disadvantageous tactic of just waltzing in through the front gate of an enemy encampment and makes it potentially just as rewarding as silently going through an encampment and stealthily clearing out a bunch of guards.  Open-world games can often feature some of the most beautiful virtual landscapes there are, and Ghost of Tsushima is right up there with the best of them. It may not quite meet the promise of its 2018 gameplay reveal trailer, but this is still a stunningly gorgeous game. Every scene is densely packed with grass, trees, leaves, and flowers all gently blowing in the wind every which way you turn. The island of Tsushima is teeming with natural beauty, which makes it a joy to explore even if you don’t have a particular destination in mind. Sucker Punch’s design encourages exactly that, with traditional waypoints being integrated into the environment instead of a UI overlay. Following a plume of smoke will always lead you to something worth investigating; a tree with different-colored leafs off in the distance will always yield some sort of reward; and following a trail of Torii gates will never disappoint. It’s all refreshingly organic, much like how it was in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, especially considering that even when you do set a waypoint from your map to head toward a specific quest or location, instead of following arrows on the screen you’ll follow the direction of the wind. Sidequests are interesting in Ghost of Tsushima because there are actually several different types. The first and most common are your typical garden-variety tasks called Tales of Tsushima, which are short stories that have Jin going off and being the good and honorable samurai that he wants to be by helping people with their problems. Though the stories and characters in these sidequests are largely forgettable, at the very least they don’t seem like they’re just being churned out and used as padding. These are often thoughtful enough to be more special than they might initially let on thanks to some often unexpectedly dark turns and occasionally interesting gameplay scenarios. One, for example, is really the only time where I was literally surrounded by archers and nothing else. They were all spaced out on different levels of two opposing cliff sides, making it a fun and unique challenge that’s not replicated elsewhere. One level above that e Tales are multi-part, character-specific sidequests that basically span the entire campaign and serve to give each major character their own story arc. This includes Sensei Ishikawa, the renowned samurai archer searching for his missing student; Masako, a grief-stricken mother out for revenge on those who murdered her family; or Yuna, the thief who saved your life at the very beginning of the story and will do whatever it takes to save her brother from the Mongols. Each of these sidestories reflects an aspect of Jin’s own journey, and it’s very interesting to see both how they develop and the impact they have on his development. Some of the later ones that I’m not allowed to talk about due to embargo restrictions are especially touching and deal with some pretty heavy subject matter, with one in particular that makes exceptional use of Ghost of Tsushima’s scouting mechanic in a very clever and emotional way. Tales of Tsushima  typically reward you with charms that boost a certain aspect of your character, allowing you to spec into specific character builds like stealth, tanky, or a focus on critical hits, and so on. In the early going these charms were a great incentive to complete sidequests, but once I had pretty much all the charms that were needed later on, these Tales of Tsushima sidequests lost much of their appeal from a reward standpoint. I lost the desire to seek them out. My favorite thing about exploration, though, and something that I especially appreciate as someone who’s not typically big on collectibles, is that every major collectible has both a worthwhile reward and a fun mini challenge tied to it. I was always extremely eager to find new Bamboo Strikes, not only because they gave me more resolve (a resource needed to heal and use special moves) but also because I just loved doing the little button-press minigame required to collect them. Shrines are even better because in addition to being the only place where you can find major charms (which offer dramatic buffs and perks strong enough to potentially design a whole character build around) they are also the only areas that you’ll be able to find those signature Sucker Punch platforming sections familiar from the Infamous or Sly series. The minor collectibles, like Mongol artifacts, journal entries, sashimono banners, and pillars of honor, are less exciting – they only offer some minor cosmetic items or flavor text. But they are plentiful enough that they still provide some added value for trophy hunters – and at least Ghost of Tsushima makes hunting them very easy thanks to the ability to quickly fast-travel to any discovered point of interest on the map. Finally, can we talk about photo mode for a second? Because Ghost of Tsushima’s photo mode is the one of the best I’ve ever seen. Partially because the world is just so pretty that it lends itself well to being captured in its natural beauty, but also because of the unique touches that Sucker Punch added, like the ability to have animated background environments or to add a large selection of particles like leaves, fireflies, or even songbirds. You can change the weather, alter the time of day, add clouds, create a camera flight path to create short videos – and all of this on top of all of the essential photo mode options like exposure sliders and filters that have become standard. My one disappointment is the fact that the customizable emotions that you can put on Jin’s face could stand to have a little more… well, emotion. But nonetheless, Ghost of Tsushima’s photo mode sets a new high water mark. Ghost of Tsushima is an enormous and densely packed samurai adventure that often left me completely awestruck with both its visual spectacle and excellent combat. By steadily introducing new abilities instead of stat upgrades, its swordplay manages to stay challenging, rewarding, and fun throughout the entire 40 to 50 hours that it took me to beat the campaign. A few aspects are surprisingly lacking in polish in comparison to other first-party Sony games, especially when it comes to enemy AI and the stealth part of its stealth/action split. Still this is an extraordinary open-world action-adventure game that solves several issues that have long gone unaddressed in the genre, while also just being an all around samurai slashin’ good time.

350,F1 2020 ,9.0,"Formula One is very much defined by its superstar drivers. Hamilton. Schumacher. Senna. These names loom large over entire eras of F1 racing. But while it’s the drivers that get the adulation, the legacies, and the lucrative watch endorsement deals, above all that Formula One is still a team sport. F1 2020 is without doubt the most superb interpretation of that yet, bringing a satisfyingly deep management angle to the most feature-filled Formula One game I can remember.  Formula One really is much, much more than just driver versus driver. It’s organisation versus organisation in a chequebook-shattering technological arms race, and F1 2020’s fantastic new My Team mode is a wonderful and addictive representation of this war over precious milliseconds.  While past F1 career modes have allowed us to control car upgrade R&amp;D on behalf of our employers, giving drivers at least some influence on what happens off the circuit, My Team massively eclipses this. You need to build a brand new team from the ground up, effectively becoming the 11th team within the F1 championship. That means choosing team colours, assembling a logo, signing a power unit, securing sponsors, honing a livery and matching race suits, contracting a second driver, and watching your finances as you attempt to grow your organisation into an outfit that can challenge the established powerhouses.   Yes, the livery selection scope is ultimately pretty narrow. Yes, it’s a bit silly that showing any kind of specific attention to one department makes the rest of your staff grumpy, like they’re a bunch of five-year-olds who missed out on a cookie. Yes, some of the recycled cutscenes clash a bit with the fantasy of you being the boss now. But, minor grievances aside, mixing a robust motorsports management experience with the series’ existing brand of excellent on-track action means My Team isn’t just the best thing Codemasters has ever added to its F1 franchise – it may be the best addition to any F1 game since Psygnosis coaxed Murray Walker into a sound booth back in the late ’90s.  Perhaps best of all, however, is the return of split-screen. And yes, it seems a little silly to celebrate something we had back in 1996, but I’ve had a hoot playing F1 2020’s splitscreen with my kids. You can choose any driver and car you want but we’ve had fun turning the splitscreen into a bit of couch co-op by racing on the same team and striving for 1-2 finishes. I did glance down at one point to find the AI struggling to extract themselves from a monster wreck at Monza my son found himself caught in, but he was howling with laughter at the time, so well played, Codemasters. After all, anything can happen in Formula One, and it usually does.   The casual driving model provides a helpful friction assist for off-track excursions and an automatic respawn feature for F1 newbies, but F1 2020 caters for the other end of the spectrum too, with improved grip on corner exits thanks to some massaging of the tyre model, and a more realistic ERS deployment mechanic. The main function is now mapped to a single, more authentic ‘Overtake’ button. There are also neat, nerdy touches like the ability to fiddle with the HUD and fully customise what you want on screen. F1 2020 is simultaneously the deepest yet most accessible Codemasters Formula One experience to date. The heavy reliance on recycled vignettes and the same old faces we’ve been seeing for virtually an entire generation admittedly means F1 2020 doesn’t necessarily look as fresh as it feels but, between My Team and splitscreen, this is the most fun I’ve had with the F1 series for years.

351,Hunting Simulator 2 ,7.0, It seems like a lifetime ago now, but there was a time when I woke up before dawn, geared up in blaze-orange attire, and took to the woods of Maine in pursuit of the elusive whitetail deer. I was a freshman in high school and desperately wanted to fit in at our new school where hunting, not ""playing Nintendo,"" was the preferred hobby of my peers. It turns out I much preferred staying indoors and playing video games to standing outside in the frigid Maine autumn while nothing happened for hours at a time. Thankfully, Hunting Simulator 2 combines a hobby I didn't enjoy too much as a teen with one I still love to this day. While I don't go hunting anymore, almost everyone I know is obsessed with it (I still live in Maine), and I have been known to stalk whitetail with a camera rather than a loaded rifle. Hunting Simulator 2 scratches the primordial hunter-itch I didn't know I still had, while allowing me to stalk prey from the comfort of my home office. Plus there are zero bloodstains to contend with, which is another bonus. As a simulation, it does a great job, and as a game, it also succeeds. It sacrifices some realism for the sake of quality of life, sure, and it lacks any kind of concrete goals, but at the end of the day, I found Hunting Simulator 2 a fun and oddly relaxing way to spend some time.  I'll just get this one out of the way immediately: you can pet the dog. In fact, it helps build your bond with the canine companions that venture out into the wilderness with you. You start off with a beagle, adept at sniffing out tracks and putting you on the path to a trophy, but you can add more dogs to your kennel as you progress. Each dog breed is specialized for a task: pointers will ""point"" in the direction of a hidden animal, while retrievers do exactly what their name implies. I found out the importance of bringing along a retriever (I named him Puppers and he's a good boy) when I went duck hunting and discovered I couldn't swim out to get my trophies. No respectable outdoorsman would leave carcasses like that, and I was appropriately fined when I returned to my hunting lodge. I really like how Hunting Simulator 2 requires you to bring along the right dog for the job. You can choose to hunt without any companions, but they're super useful for small prey, and if you're going to hit your bag limit, they'll expedite the process by retrieving, pointing, and following scent trails. There's more than just dogs to add to your hunting lodge: you can purchase gear, new guns, and even bows to spice things up a bit. The selection of hunting guns is huge, and Hunting Simulator 2 has officially-licensed firearms from companies like Winchester, as well as officially-licensed outdoor gear from outfitters like Browning. The licensed apparel and firearms make for a more realistic setting, with names instantly recognizable to anyone who hunts as a hobby. On top of guns and apparel, there are binoculars and range finders, as well as consumables like scent lures, scent-covers, and wind-direction indication sprays. They're easy to use: pushing a button brings up your item wheel and it's a simple matter of hitting the action button to use them. They're all really useful, particularly the wind indicators. Initially I didn't think the wind direction made a difference, but after my virtual-scent alerted my presence to a trophy elk, I made sure my item list for the next hunt included a bottle.  After you're fully outfitted with your guns and gear (and dog, of course), you select from one of six different locations, grouped into three geographical areas. There are two Colorado locations, two in Texas, and two European hunting grounds. Each location has its own different geography and animals, although there is some crossover between them, as is the case in real life (for example, real whitetail deer are damn near everywhere in the US now). Aside from the different animals to hunt, and different scenery and terrain, maps are tied together with campsites, a cabin, and different towers and blinds to discover. Campsites are fast-travel locations, only unlocked after discovery, and they're spread out pretty well over the massive maps. My instinct was to run around the maps like a madman, but you actually get penalized for doing so: animals are much more likely to hear you running than walking, and you actually see fewer. Walking feels incredibly slow, almost to the point of frustration, but once I learned to zero in my patience, I was rewarded by finding more animals, and even finding more evidence of animals like tracks and droppings. It's truly a walking simulator, but once I adjusted, I found it relaxing rather than annoying, especially with the ambient sounds of the wind and birds chirping in the distance. Since this is a simulator and not a ""game,"" the hunting is pretty realistic insomuch as it takes a lot of walking and waiting before you see anything worth aiming at. Hunting Simulator 2 also doesn't allow you to just blast away at every animal no matter what the caliber rifle or gauge of shotgun you have. A .30-06, ideal for large game like deer, elk, and bison, would completely obliterate a bobcat or wild boar. If you aim at one with the wrong gun, Hunting Simulator 2 warns you you're using the wrong caliber. If you fire anyway, you ruin your trophy and the prospect of collecting the credits needed to buy more gear and licenses. As fun as it is walking around the maps, I wish Hunting Simulator 2 had some kind of mission structure. There are achievements, sure, but what ended up happening is I'd grab two guns (one high-powered, one smaller-caliber), pack up my gear and wander the countryside shooting as many of God's creatures as I could before I reached my license limit or ran out of ammo. A mode asking me to, say, bring home my bag-limit of mallards or hunt only whitetail deer would have narrowed down the focus of what's currently a pretty open-ended experience. The license system works to prevent you from bringing home a Noah's-ark's worth of trophies, but you need to make sure you have the right licenses before you head out into the field. Each geographic location requires a license to hunt, with separate licenses for the different kinds of animals. For example, you can hunt whitetail with a Texas whitetail license, but you need to get a Colorado whitetail license to hunt them in Colorado. I learned that the hard way when I spent 20 minutes wandering the Texas backcountry only for Hunting Simulator 2 to warn me I was unlicensed when I finally aimed at a pronghorn in the distance. The actual act of hunting is thrilling. Stalking an animal through the wilderness and waiting until just the right moment to fire off that perfect shot holds a lot of the appeal of the real thing. Thankfully, Hunting Simulator 2 pumps the brakes a bit after you down your prey: you're not required to gut it out or drag it out of the woods to your cabin. Just approach it, push a button, and it's magically delivered there. I appreciate the quality of life touches, because hauling a deer out of the woods is, quite literally, a drag. I like Hunting Simulator 2 a lot more than I expected I would. Its relaxing pace is punctuated by moments of excitement when you see or hear the animal you're after, just like in real life. The realism is further built up by the licensed gear and firearms available for purchase. I definitely appreciate that Hunting Simulator 2 sticking to the fun parts while leaving out the post-kill process. My one wish is it had some kind of mission structure, or at least a challenge mode. But those are minor complaints, as I found myself drawn into it in a way I hadn't initially anticipated. "
352,Trackmania ,7.0, Some games not only stand the test of time, they actively defy it. That’s undoubtedly the case for Trackmania’s over-the-top time trials and deep track editor – a simple but addictive combination that’s earned the series a dedicated community for nearly two decades. The latest entry, a remake of 2006’s TrackMania Nations simply called Trackmania, feels like a return to form in many ways. But an off-putting subscription system and poor tools to actually teach you its intricacies make it a bittersweet reunion. While there’s plenty of racing in Trackmania, the main event has always been variations on time trials. Whether you’re playing alone or against others online, you’re always really competing against your own skills. This can make a lot of Trackmania’s modes feel repetitive, whether its Time Attack, the team multiplayer of Chase or the traditional circuit-based Lap. But that drive to master a track is more than enough reason to keep coming back.  Unfortunately, Trackmania has never explained itself particularly well, and 2020’s rendition is no different. An all too brief tutorial covers the basics, but you’re on your own when it comes to learning the mechanical subtlety behind getting truly fast times – tricks like nudging the jetpack-like reactor boost in midair to hover through midair checkpoints you didn’t see coming. That gives Trackmania a steeper learning curve than it ought to have. But once you zoom past those initial speed bumps, Trackmania can be hard to put down. Finishing any of its decent launch selection of 45+ official tracks can take less than 90 seconds a piece, but you’ll want to play them over and over to shave off seconds and find all the clever shortcuts hidden in plain sight. The potent sounds of your engine roaring backed by high energy music can even eventually become quite soothing, drawing you in as you boost, jump, and drift around each corner in perfect rhythm. That doesn’t mean that you’ll be calmly cruising to the finish line though. Trackmania’s cars always feel floaty around turns, and you often pick up speed faster than you think you should. That may sound like a bad thing, but it actually contributes to the feeling that you’re perpetually just on the edge of losing control, which makes it all the more exhilarating when you dial things in just right and hit the goal for a gold medal.  The other side of the Trackmania coin is its custom tracks, which remain as impressive as ever – partially thanks to an intuitive block-based editor. Even before release, there are already user-made tracks ranging from recreations of Mario Kart classics to car golf to a rudimentary version of bumper cars. One dark course full of lamp posts felt like a throwback to Night Driver on the Atari 2600. Another downward slope felt like a slide from a water park that could send your vehicle flipping and flying at any moment. You never really know what you’ll get as you rummage through Trackmania’s course selections, and that’s half the fun. Time will tell if custom servers can achieve the level of plugin-based madness seen in the days of Trackmania 2, but creators already seem to have the means to go nuts in all sorts of ways. Unfortunately, not everyone who plays Trackmania can utilize these tools thanks to its unappealing new subscription service. You can play on official tracks and use a simplified map editor entirely for free, but most other things require either the “Standard” or “Club” access subscriptions, which are $10 and $30 per year respectively. Without open access to custom tracks and other community features like chat, it’s less of a free-to-play experience and more of a glorified demo. Gating off access like this runs the risk of putting a damper on the community support that makes Trackmania shine long term. 2016’s Trackmania Turbo proved the community won’t automatically rally around the latest entry in the series just because it’s new, especially when you can load up new tracks in TrackMania 2 for the rest of your life at no extra cost. This new Trackmania is definitely a fun return with an impressive new coat of paint, but there’s not really enough that’s brand new to justify a recurring entry fee. Nadeo has committed to adding a new set of official tracks every season for all players, but that can only differentiate things so much compared to what the community cooks up.  What’s the difference between the “Standard’ and “Club” tiers you may ask? The biggest difference lies right in the names. Only Club members can create and join Clubs, which are Trackmania’s solution to the lack of an online server browser. Each Club acts as its own server, but it can also host specific custom tracks and car skins to download. If you’re not subscribed at all, you have to rely on random Arcade matchmaking to even get a chance at seeing custom maps, and you can’t download any you stumble on to replay later. Standard members can join Club servers to have a bit more control, but they can’t really participate directly beyond that. Serious track creators will also need to cough up the annual cash for either paid tier, as the advanced track editor (which unlocks tools vital to making anything more than a basic course) is only available for subscribers. There are certainly people who enjoy Trackmania for its single-player elements alone, which includes free official tracks quarterly, and the F2P tier will no doubt be exciting for that type of player. But for anyone who wants to see the full depth of what Trackmania has to offer, you’re going to end up wanting the most expensive option eventually. You can find all the details of what’s in each tier in this almost comically convoluted chart, a perfect example of how this system is an overcomplicated and unnerving cloud hanging over the entire experience.  Whether you’re playing free or paid, Trackmania’s fancy new graphics at least makes everything look and feel fresh – it’s not going to stand up to the latest Forza or Gran Turismo, but this more lighthearted take on racing isn’t exactly trying to. Cars have a great sheen to them that persists even as you pick up speed and focus on the road ahead. Outside of the races, Trackmania doesn’t look as impressive. Its menus are poorly cobbled together – but as a longtime fan, that off-kilter feeling oddly seems like a core part of the Trackmania experience at this point, and Nadeo probably knows it. Maniaplanet may be gone, but the charm of strange font choices and obtuse settings reminded me exactly what game I was playing, even if those rough edges will probably keep newcomers at arms length. Trackmania’s mechanically nuanced time trials are as tense and addictive in 2020 as they were in 2006. The initial content selection of this latest entry is robust and a wealth of entertaining custom tracks are potentially just a click away… as long as both you and the community of talented track creators are willing to pay for its yearly subscription, that is. The idea that you’ll have to rebuy this version of Trackmania annually raises very real concerns about its longevity, but right now at least, it offers a well-modernized (if not revolutionary) take on a uniquely entertaining racing experience that threw out the rulebook years ago.

353,Phantom: Covert Ops ,6.0, Let me say up front that I’m in no way saying that no special forces commando has ever stealthily infiltrated an enemy stronghold exclusively via kayak without ever setting foot on land. I mean, if such a soldier exists, they must be such a badass that no one has ever seen them and lived. But for the sake of argument, let’s say it’s a goofy premise for a VR stealth game, and Phantom: Covert Ops leans into it hard enough that it sort of works.   Where Phantom does stand out is in how you sneak around. Propelling yourself through the water is pretty fun once you get over how ridiculous waving a virtual kayak paddle looks to anybody watching – picture someone doggy-paddling through the air. I ended up getting into it, though, even putting my feet up on a footstool to simulate sitting in a kayak (though this sometimes made it difficult to reach items in my lap). It’s cool to build up some speed, then hold the A button on the right controller and dip a paddle to make tight turns, though it’s a little inconsistent about when you can just hold the paddle and when you have to push repeatedly.  Because of that imprecision it’s probably a good thing that, as stealth games go, this is a fairly simple and forgiving one. Granted, AI needs to be predictable and robotic for successful stealth to feel like solving a puzzle rather than just getting lucky, but these guys are hilariously dumb. Your binoculars permanently mark enemies for you, and soldiers are all but completely blind unless you float directly into their flashlight beams or zoom by them at top speed. I found myself being thankful that Phantom doesn’t use the Rift’s microphone to pick up sound that could be perceived by enemies because I was usually laughing in their faces at how brazenly I could lazily cruise by under their noses – sometimes literally when they’re standing on a bridge.  Sometimes just sailing by isn’t an option because an area is well lit or heavily patrolled, but in those cases there are usually highlighted objects like lights, radios, and fire extinguishers you can shoot to create a diversion and draw them away. Failing that you’ve always got a silenced pistol at your side that can drop all but the most armored of enemies with a single headshot. You even get about five seconds of slow-motion reaction time to take out whoever spotted you.  I did enjoy being given permission to take out certain VIP war criminals when their identities were revealed by a scan – usually they have friends around who must be distracted (or killed if you don’t mind running up the body count) which made for some rare moments where I had to game out how the AI would react. That doesn’t mean it’s always easy: if you get cocky and don’t stop to recognize patterns in enemy movements you can easily find yourself taken by surprise, and you die from just a few shots. Likewise, a couple of boss fight segments killed me multiple times as I figured out how to avoid invulnerable attack helicopters and snipers.  Of course, the real challenge is running up the score by completing a level quickly, silently, and non-lethally – that’s where the replayability comes from. On my first playthrough I only scored one A-grade in the between-mission report, so even though its campaign is only four or five hours long I could see myself replaying some to chase a few better scores.  It doesn’t help that even on the Rift S running off a GeForce RTX 2080 with the settings maxed out, Phantom doesn’t look fantastic. Texture resolution gets obviously low when you get close to a wall or have to throw switches, and soldier animations are barebones. Notably for such a wet game, there’s not much by way of wake and splash effects – in the first level, for example, you use a large cargo ship to cover your entrance to the base, but there’s virtually no disturbance in the water behind it. The tradeoff is that you can play on the modestly powered Oculus Quest, so it’s not all bad. When you’re done with the campaign there are a bunch of simple shooting gallery and timed kill’em-all challenges you can unlock and compete in to test your skill with the assortment of weaponry, plus you get the free play option that lets you revisit any of the levels with any equipment loadout you choose. Those extras do manage to make Phantom feel a little meatier. Phantom: Covert Ops is certainly a novel approach to a VR stealth game. Putting you in a stealth kayak to sneak up on ex-Soviet terrorists is a concept I didn’t see coming, and neither do the virtually night-blind enemy soldiers you’re up against. It’s a bit simple even for its short length, and it doesn’t look as sharp as some other recent VR games, but the kayak is pretty fun when you get the hang of it and chasing those high scores adds some replay value.

354,Borderlands 3: Bounty of Blood DLC ,9.0, After the last few good-but-not-great expansions for Borderlands 3, it brings me great joy to tell you that Bounty of Blood is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, my favorite Borderlands 3 DLC so far. In fact, I'd go so far as to say this might be my favorite Borderlands-anything since Borderlands 2 way back in 2012. A novel approach to storytelling, likable characters, an interesting new world to explore, and of course gobs and gobs of great loot all come together to cross the border into greatness.   It's kind of funny to think Borderlands, a game whose origins drew inspiration from the fusion of the American frontier and science-fiction futurism, would come full-circle like this. Somewhere along the way, Borderlands felt like it shifted away from being about lands… on the border… so it's great to have that old familiar feel back in a way, even if it's explicit rather than implicit.  On top of the usual unfolding of the story, there's a narrator guiding your progress the entire way, and the narrator – a grizzled cowpoke called ""The Liar"" – works wonderfully. His lines were something I didn't even know I wanted until I had it, and now I can’t get enough. The Liar will occasionally drop hints, too – When I was battling a boss, he made reference to its weakpoint’s location more than once, and it dawned on me that, oh yeah, if I go where he's guiding me to I'll have a better chance to dole out some damage. Another reason the narrator and the main story for Bounty of Blood as a whole work is that they practice some rare restraint when it comes to humor. That's not to say there aren't any jokes – far from it. They're here, and they definitely fit the overall Borderlands 3 tone. But as far as the main quest, Gearbox has pumped the brakes on the humor and gone for a much mellower tone. It's more Jeff Bridges in The Big Lebowski and less Jeff Daniels in Dumb &amp; Dumber. One of my complaints with Borderlands 3 was it had too many jokes. I know, it sounds ridiculous to say, but hear me out. Comedy is all about timing, yet Borderlands 3 jams jokes into every nook and cranny, whether the situation calls for them or not, almost reaching the point of self-parody. There’s no buildup – it’s just punchline after punchline after punchline with no time for thoughtful buildup. Bounty of Blood, on the other hand, rations out the humor, doling it out in delicious servings that are neither too big nor too small. This Goldilocks Zone of jokes makes the comedy so much more effective – more akin to the original Borderlands. Levels in Bounty of Blood are huge and beg for exploration. I was really impressed by how massive and well-planned each map is, and appreciated how, in spite of their size, Bounty of Blood’s areas feel easy to navigate. I stuck mostly to the path at hand for the main story, but when I noticed a place with an unusually placed rockface or conveniently located broken staircase, my curiosity paid off by way of hidden treasures. Being rewarded with loot exactly where decades of gaming logic told me I'd find loot seems so obvious, but it never stops being great. Speaking of treasures, the loot in Bounty of Blood is plentiful. I managed to score orange-rarity loot drops well before the end of the story, and letting me use those fancy new toys for the final battle was a nice touch. I absolutely adore my Bloom Jakobs pistol: charging it up unleashes all six powerful shots in a rapid, bloody flurry, often resulting in instant death for whatever or whoever is on the receiving end. I also came across a ton of new decorations for my room back on Sanctuary 3, including one item used when the main quest is beaten, that then becomes decorative after use. It's a nice little trophy for completing the main story. I don't remember getting so many in the previous DLC, and as a sucker for arbitrary in-game cosmetic items I was delighted.   Likewise, Boss fights in Bounty of Blood's story are nicely paced and never feel overwhelming or beyond the realm of possibility to solo. There are a few fights, particularly the final boss, where it's obvious the designers had co-op in mind (as they should!), but even then solo runs aren't out of the question. I particularly appreciated the novel use of The Liar to gently nudge me in the right direction in one of the main fights. The narration didn't beat me over the head, but it was enough to both help me while flowing seamlessly with the overall story. With well-paced comedy, fun boss fights, an East-meets-West setting I absolutely love, and some serious high-powered loot, Borderlands 3: Bounty of Blood is the most Borderlands Borderlands since Borderlands. Yeah, this is some great DLC. ! The clever main story, the use of the grizzled narrator, and some cool new characters make these some of my favorite Borderlands hours in almost a decade. I wish the freshness had carried over to the sidequests, but there's enough in the way of exploration and collectibles and strong writing to make up for the numerous fetch quests that still rear their ugly heads. "
355,Pokémon Sword and Shield: The Isle of Armor DLC ,9.0, While it may be surprising to see DLC in a Pokémon game for the first time, Sword and Shield’s Expansion Pass is definitely preferable to its traditional model of following up the latest game with another full-price version just to deliver some new content and a few improvements. The Isle of Armor, the Expansion Pass’s first of two bundled DLC additions, provides an entertaining reason to revisit the Galar region with over 100 returning Pokemon (plus a few new ones) and an enjoyable new Wild Area. But this island getaway is otherwise pretty bare bones and disappointingly brief. Like the free-roaming Wild Area in the main Sword and Shield campaign, The Isle of Armor’s is complete with an excess of untamed Pokémon wandering around, dozens of dens for Max Raid Battles, and plenty of items to find and collect. Without the usual Gym structure (or even linear Routes), this DLC’s main quest line instead has you running missions throughout its open space – it’s much more freeform than the usual Pokémon experience, which feels like a natural and not unwelcome progression after the first Wild Area showed how well an “open world” Pokémon could potentially work, even if the story here is too fleeting to really savor it.   From our November 2019 Pokemon Sword and Shield review by Casey DeFreitas: ""Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield are closer to my dream Pokemon RPGs than anything that’s come before. I’d still like better cutscenes, companion Pokemon, the complete Pokedex, and a more visually interesting Wild Area, but nitpicks are just not very effective when everything else was such a complete joy to play. The way they respect my time is wonderful, and the removal of monotony from random encounters and other odds and ends distills it down to only the pure and charming fun of capturing, training, and battling wonderful creatures. And hey, if I’m missing any tedious repetition, I can always get back into breeding.""  While it may not be as big as the original Wild Area in overall acreage, The Isle of Armor more than makes up for it in its diversity and in how well it uses the space. You’ll find tangled forests filled with Tangela and oceans where Sharpedo’s pursue you with frightening speed. Even if it can all be seen in a few short hours, it’s undoubtedly an entertaining trek that does a great job of making the world feel alive and more fleshed out than the Wild Area from the base game. The Isle of Armor unfortunately doesn’t mark the return of the complete National Pokédex, but it does significantly expand the Pokémon available in Sword and Shield with more than 100 returning pocket monsters. It’s a great selection, including some sorely needed additions like Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and most of all: Lickilicky, which is obviously the best Pokémon ever conceived.  Unfortunately, Isle of Armor doesn’t use its new, lovingly crafted area very effectively, as the DLC’s campaign amounts to just a few short missions that can be finished in a couple hours, most of which are uninspired fetch quests. You’ll run around looking for mushrooms and fighting off Slowpoke on a decidedly low stakes adventure that feels like a fairly by-the-numbers RPG side quest. There are certainly some highlights, like the part where you need to befriend and level up the brand new and pretty darn lovable Kubfu to unlock one of its two legendary evolutions. But it all feels very shallow with no real narrative holding it together, and Pokemon in the wild almost universally capping out at level 60 means anyone who has beaten the base game will be able to breeze through the whole thing like I did. It also doesn’t help that one of the DLC’s chief characters, your new rivals (Klara for Sword players, and Avery for Shield), are both incredibly annoying and written off largely as a punchline rather than anything resembling a real threat. The other two major characters, a dojo master named Mustard, and his wife Honey, are amusing, but don’t get enough time in the spotlight to really shine. That said, Isle of Armor introduces a few new mechanics that do a lot to break the mold of Sword and Shield in positive ways. A welcome item called Max Soup allows you to Gigantimax your Pokémon even if they weren’t caught in a Max Raid Battle. A surprising new base-building mechanic lets you upgrade Mustard’s dojo by spending Watts, unlocking helpful new services and items. And of course, there are plenty of cool new cosmetics, like clothes and bicycle skins. Sadly, there isn’t a ton left to do once the campaign is over, aside from catching the island’s plentiful returning Pokémon – though you’ll now be able to do that with the Pokémon of your choice following you around the DLC areas, which is a nice cosmetic reward earned by progressing through the story. One of the main draws is Restricted Sparring, a challenging endgame mode that pits three of your Pokémon of the same type against five opposing trainers in a row (and then an endless onslaught of them after that) – it’s a creative new format, but is only appealing if you’re looking to earn BP for the Battle Tower. There’s also a boring side quest where you run around looking for 151 Digletts buried in the ground that’s nightmarishly tedious, and hardly worth the various Alolan versions of Pokémon you get as a reward.  The Isle of Armor DLC is the first part of the Pokémon Sword and Shield Expansion Pass, which will eventually include two expansions – The Isle of Armor and The Crown Tundra (coming sometime later this year). Crucially, The Isle of Armor is not sold separately from the Expansion Pass, so this DLC is only one part of a bigger whole. We’ll be reviewing The Crown Tundra when it releases, but this review is only evaluating The Isle of Armor since that’s currently all the Expansion Pass will get you. dir=""ltr""  Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield are closer to my dream Pokemon RPGs than anything that’s come before. I’d still like better cutscenes, companion Pokemon, the complete Pokedex, and a more visually interesting Wild Area, but nitpicks are just not very effective when everything else was such a complete joy to play. The way they respect my time is wonderful, and the removal of monotony from random encounters and other odds and ends distills it down to only the pure and charming fun of capturing, training, and battling wonderful creatures.

356,Torchlight 3 Early Access ,6.0, There’s nothing desperately wrong with Torchlight 3, which just came out in Early Access form a week ago. It’s a flashy, bombastic, nicely-paced action-RPG with tons of enemies to slash, blast, and explode for the tasty loot inside. The problem is that it doesn’t really do much to effectively set itself above or apart from the embarrassment of riches we have to pick from in this genre right now. When I could be playing Diablo 3 or Wolcen (now that it's been patched a bit) or Path of Exile or even one of the older Torchlight games, I keep looking for a reason why I’d choose Torchlight 3… and so far, the early access version hasn’t really given me one. Torchlight 3 doesn’t put its best foot forward as it tries to introduce us to a story premise that isn’t really trying to be anything more than ultra generic fantasy. Something about an ancient evil reawakening, blah blah blah... It’s not like previous Torchlight games were heavy on story either, but Torchlight 3 doesn’t even seem to be trying. Every NPC seems to be defined by a single personality archetype. You’ve got goofy goblins that lean on the comedy crutches of over-the-top voice acting and Saturday morning cartoon hijinks. It’s got a certain charm to it, but it’s all so painfully familiar, like your slacker roommate’s first attempt at running a Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign.  At least things get a little more interesting when it comes to the class design. Each of the four playable classes has a very distinct and flavorful aesthetic and identity. The weird and eerie Dusk Mage builds up dark mana by using light spells and light mana by using dark spells, and can unleash a more powerful finisher of either type once the appropriate mana gauge is filled. The hilariously over-the-top Railmaster reimagines the concept of a pet class by summoning a battle train that follows you around on rails you leave behind as you move, to which more cars with different uses can be added by investing in the skill tree. The options for customizing these classes are a little bit lackluster, too, especially compared to some other recent ARPGs. Each has two main skill trees with a different focus – the Sharpshooter has one focusing on direct ranged damage and one focusing on summonable creatures, while the Railmaster has one focused on melee combat and one focused on making his train bigger and nastier. But each only features a handful of abilities to invest in right now, and since they’re gated at five level intervals, the choices you have upon levelling up are usually pretty limited. dir=""ltr""  The enemy design is respectable, but doesn’t offer much that’s new and exciting if you’ve been around the ARPG block a few times. You’ll blast through hordes of weakling goblins, bugs, and zombies. Occasionally you’ll run into tricker enemies, like wild boars that can take you out in just a couple of hits with a charge attack. There are powerful elite creatures with randomized ability modifiers, as well as legendary and miniboss bruisers packed with rare loot for your trouble. The bigger area and act bosses are a highlight, offering substantial challenges and keeping me on my toes with deadly area attacks. Playing on Hard, the difficulty felt just about right. The most frustrating part of Torchlight 3’s combat, which I still haven’t stopped fuming over, is the fact that almost none of the active abilities can be triggered unless you’ve come to a complete stop. That means you have to finish any ongoing animations and wait around a second – which may as well be a decade in some of these encounters. If I’m firing my bow and need to quickly dodge roll out of an explosion, I have to stop everything I’m doing and press the button frantically until it becomes responsive. It just feels clunky and irritating. dir=""ltr""  Probably the most distinctive and promising feature in Torchlight 3 is also a player housing system that lets you decorate a personal fort, enchant your gear, house collectable pets, and sacrifice items to various altars to unlock permanent stat bonuses. There are tons of cosmetic and functional structures to unlock and craft, and I like being able to return from a cave full of death spiders to a space that feels like my own. Decorating the courtyard is a nice change of pace from fighting for your life. This is where Torchlight 3 feels the most innovative, and I’d love to see this aspect developed further before it launches out of Early Access. Torchlight 3’s current Early Access incarnation is a fast food combo meal of an ARPG. In almost every respect, it’s acceptable. It’s fine. It’s just not revolutionary or memorable or even especially fun compared to its competition. And maybe as it progresses toward its final form, things will shape up and some diamonds will start to emerge from the rough. But for now, I’d have a hard time recommending it to anyone who might be drawn in by its attractive and distinct look and attitude. You won’t find much of substance to back it up, and there are so many better options to get your dungeon-crawling, loot-inhaling fix. "
357,SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated ,5.0,"SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated marks the return of one of the most iconic licensed characters to enter the 3D platforming fray. Sadly, this flashy remake feels more like a skin-deep remaster in practice, doing little to fix the issues that plagued the original adventure. Its graphical update is accompanied by some imaginative improvements, but those few bright spots aren’t enough to bring Battle for Bikini Bottom’s passable but simplistic and collectathon-heavy gameplay up to the standard you’d expect from a platformer released in 2020 – especially with remakes like the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy and Spyro Reignited Trilogy showing how a revival like this should be done. In our October 2003 review of the original Battle for Bikini Bottom, reviewer Mary Jane Irwin said: “The love for the SpongeBob franchise really shines through in Battle for Bikini Bottom -- and if it weren't there this would be a very dreary title.” As I replay it nearly 17 years later, that feels extremely accurate – and what’s dreariest about Rehydrated’s 10-ish hour campaign is all the missed opportunities to truly modernize this adventure for first-timers and those of us who look back on it fondly alike.  To its credit, Rehydrated runs cleanly on PlayStation 4 Pro, its remastered soundtrack’s cheery tunes have earwormed their way into my mind, and the actual feel of running, jumping, and bubble-blowing as SpongeBob is precise and responsive. But it’s largely the adventure around those mechanics which, while admittedly fun and enjoyable for how it took advantage of the SpongeBob license just a few years after its debut, remains as limited in its scope, design, and overall thoughtfulness so many years later as it did back on the original Xbox. Worse, it now comes with the added context of having been so thoroughly surpassed by almost two decades worth of amazing 3D platformers.   It’s been years since I’ve watched SpongeBob, and the pleasantness of returning to Bikini Bottom for a few hours was occasionally fun. But even though it’s called a remake, in every conceivable way it feels like a disappointing remaster, with its PS2-era hang-ups often getting in the way. A remake should do its best to modernize and improve aspects that haven’t aged well, but Rehydrated rarely does that. Every entrance to a new area is saddled with a few seconds of load time, even when going into a small building like Patrick or Squidward’s one-room homes (PlayStation 5, you can’t get here soon enough!). All three playable characters – SpongeBob, Sandy, and Patrick – have the same repetitive line or two of dialogue they bleat out after finding collectibles, grabbing health, or hitting enemies. The first couple of times it’s amusing enough to hear Patrick’s uncertainty about wearing SpongeBob’s underwear, but by the 10th it’s grating. And by the 30th, I wanted to stop playing. Battle for Bikini Bottom still hits that sweet spot of absurdist mayhem that SpongeBob episodes so often nailed, but it doesn’t really work as a cohesive SpongeBob “episode” (or even movie) because the individual stories of its already disjointed levels are barely present. Mrs. Puff and Barnacle Boy deliver some great, cutting lines that go over SpongeBob’s head, and SpongeBob interpreting paragraphs out of Gary the Snail’s Meows is still a joy. But, even as someone who hasn’t watched the show in ages, it’s absolutely jarring when one of the original voice actors doesn’t voice their own iconic character, like Mr. Krabs’ Clancy Brown who was absent in the original and is still not voicing the role in Rehydrated since very little new dialogue was seemingly recorded. Playing Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated in 2020 is a strange roller coaster ride of platforming love and hate. Overall, it’s an incredibly easy platformer, with only a few truly challenging section thrown in. The welcome challenge in levels like SpongeBob’s Dream is often fun, but they’re such whiplash from the rest of the adventure, which then reverts to being simple for its final levels. Like in the original, you can intermittently swap between SpongeBob, Sandy and Patrick, often to solve character-specific puzzles, but it’s rare that Battle for Bikini Bottom makes interesting use of this. Also, why do I have to keep trudging back to a specific location to switch characters instead of just quick-swapping with a button? That adds nothing but busywork, standing as an easy example of something a proper remake could have addressed.    If you’re just looking to replay the original Battle for Bikini Bottom adventure to revisit its sporadic bright spots, some amusing character interactions, and a romp around Bikini Bottom, then you’ll find that intact. Battle for Bikini Bottom still feels a generation behind, but its graphical update is largely appreciated. The bright, cheery, almost neon-drenched world feels a lot closer to the energy of the show and its title character than the original’s look. Characters animate well in cutscenes, with the most care clearly put into the principal cast and locations as opposed to the lifeless denizens of Bikini Bottom, who walk around serving no purpose other than set dressing. Some of the most iconic locations and buildings’ shift into three-dimensions much more cohesively than their chunkier forms did two console generations ago. But because the entire world has been made more vibrant, there’s occasionally little distinction between platforms you can actually jump on and set decoration ledges that fooled me into thinking I had found a new secret path.  It’s still nice to see the different neighborhoods of Bikini Bottom brought to life, from the dingy Rock Bottom to the Mermalair to Bikini Bottom itself. And SpongeBob’s Dream gets to play with wacky, surrealist level design buoyed by the graphical update that made me wish for an entirely new game inspired by it rather than a remake. Unfortunately, the hollowness of some of the world feels stuck in its earlier incarnation and despite plenty of Bikini Bottom residents walking around each area, interacting with them does nothing. No silly quips, no angered screams when hit, no shout of “My leg!” Just… silence, which is as loud a reminder as any of what could have been.    Battle for Bikini Bottom adds a new wave-based horde mode that lets you and one other person, either locally or online, battle against wave after wave after wave of the robotic enemies you fight in the campaign. And it is...a waste of your time. The mode is so simplistic, so monotonous, and so unrewarding that it would have been a poor addition when the original Battle for Bikini Bottom debuted in 2003 and is even worse now. Including playable characters you don’t control in the campaign is a nice touch, but they all largely play the same with only visually different melee or ranged attacks. So, sure, it’s funny to hear Squidward use his clarinet to attack the first time, but, like the repeated dialogue of the base game, it becomes grating after hearing it 10, 20, 50 more times. And the waves devolve into very little strategy other than mashing attack and corralling swarms of enemies to easily dispatch them with a ground pound. The various attacks for each character really made essentially no difference. The biggest obstacle moreso than enemies is that every few waves takes place on a different island, and plenty of enemy attacks can knock you into the surrounding water there pretty easily. But so long as one player survives a round, you both move on, and both of you dying just resets that wave. There’s little risk in being overly aggressive with enemies, and there’s little other option because the mode itself is so limited. Completing all 27 islands with a friend, each with three waves, took about 30-40 minutes. And it’s 30-40 minutes I wish I could have back. SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated makes an argument that, if you’re going to remake something beloved, it’s not worth taking any half-measures. Rehydrated’s revisit of the iconic SpongeBob platformer often does just that. Rather than addressing any of the real issues with Battle for Bikini Bottom that could have been tweaked without ruining the spirit of the original, it leaves history intact at the cost of making this a better game – and its problems have only become more noticeable with age and increased competition. There are bright spots that remain fun almost two decades later, and there are pops of ingenuity in its reworking, but it does little to stand alongside the best, or even the pretty good, platformer remakes and remasters we’ve seen this generation. "
358,Waking ,2.0, Everyone has their shortlist of their favorite food and drinks. You might like pizza, steak, red velvet cake, and chamomile tea... but you would never want to dump all of that together onto one plate, mash it all together, and then expect it to taste as good as they all do separately. And that disgusting mess of an analogy is what Waking tries to do, but for game genres; take some from Dark Souls, some from various walking simulators, a little from Silent Hill: Shattered Memories, maybe a dash of Psychonauts, and definitely a healthy serving of roguelike. None of it works together, with each piece clashing with every other in the worst way possible.   You see, your character is in a coma in a hospital bed and all wrapped in bandages, and you are traveling through your own mindscape trying to piece your brain back together so you can wake up. But there’s a twist: the God of Sleep, Somnus, tries to convince you to move on from this world instead of fighting to stay alive. So when you get to these parts of the story that ask you personal questions, it’s not really about you – it’s more just what it’s going to name things everybody encounters: an attack or summoned NPC, for example. It truly doesn’t matter what answer you give.   For one, Waking is not a looker, harkening back to that “Xbox 360 launch game” feel. It looks like it would fit right along with a game like Bullet Witch. Perhaps I’m dating myself here, but if you remember the music video for Californication by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, you can picture how these character models look. The NPCs and enemies all move in a stilted fashion and seem to snap into different animations instead of moving fluidly between actions, and the same could be said of the playable character. I often got caught on invisible level geometry, or I would do a melee attack which would also bring me to a full stop. Jumping never felt natural, with my character launching into the air like he’s got a jetpack, only to be pulled back down to the ground at a physics-defying speed. All of this ugliness just lent itself to me being unable to remember where I was or what I was supposed to be doing or going toward.  Going hand in hand with the ugliness and the repetitive landscape, the combat is also a slog. Everything you do costs a currency called neurons. It costs neurons to use basic attacks, to use items, to open certain doors, to use certain things within a level, to summon allies – but you’re only allowed to carry up to 200 neurons at a time. If there’s a way to upgrade that carrying capacity, there is no clear indication of how to do that, and this limit is stifling.   This is all wrapped within an incredibly repetitious mission system where you have to travel from map to map doing really only one type of mission: go to a place, find three of a thing, fight a boss, and then move on. And you do this for more than 20 hours. In keeping with this theme of mindless repetition, there are only two music tracks that play over and over again. One sounds like a post-rock band like This Will Destroy You or Caspian just noodling around, not making much noise. The other is the battle music, which sounds like a Sunny Day Real Estate demo that no one ever wanted. It’s nowhere near enough for a game of this length.  But the most egregious part of this whole experience was how dragged out everything is. I’ve gone on and on about the repetitive nature of the gameplay, but the story is incredibly boring and every cutscene is unskippable. All of the dialogue is delivered in what I can only assume is a made-up language, but an echoed whisper and the subtitles reveal that it has all the weight and eye-rolling seriousness of a first-year film student trying to understand metaphors.   By IGN law, I am required to mention that I didn’t quite finish this game. I tried – I put in the more-than-20-hours described, and I did reach the final area. But it’s so infuriating that I flat-out refuse to go any further. It’s honestly the most poorly designed and convoluted mess I’ve seen in any game I’ve ever played. Waking never explains what you’re supposed to be doing to reach the final boss – it just plops you in the level with a five-minute time limit. After a while, I figured out that I was supposed to walk across different colored floor panels and if I chose the wrong  one it instantly killed me. So I had to look along the walls for glowing squares to tell me which ones are safe and unsafe or pay a crystal ball to tell me one answer. That doesn’t sound too unreasonable except that the crystal ball – which costs neurons, because of course it does – just kept giving me the same answer over and over and over again. That’s not helpful because there are like 10 different colors and wouldn’t tell me the color I needed to know. I died three or four times and had had to start the level all over again and try to figure it out, mostly by guesswork. Oh, and did I mention that Waking randomizes its levels, so every time you die any of the information you gathered from the previous attempts goes right out the window? Yeah. Under no circumstances should you play Waking. If you want guided meditation, there are plenty of free apps for phones and videos on YouTube. If you want to play a Souls-like, there are plenty out there, including actual Souls games. If you need a game with psychic powers, Control is a lot of fun. But Waking does everything badly: its amateurish attempts at introspection, its poor combat, the tediously repetitious mission structure, the headache-inducing bloom effect, and aggravating puzzles add up to a miserable game I couldn’t bring myself to finish even though I reached the final level. Avoid it at all costs and do almost literally anything else with your time. "
359,Desperados 3 ,8.0, While the Western genre may be synonymous with lighting-fast duels and run-and-gun shootouts, Desperados 3’s real-time tactical stealth missions are best played at a meticulous crawl. Slow and steady is the order of the day in this often fiercely challenging game of covert cowboys, so it’s just as well that Desperados 3 gives you a colourful gang of outlaws with unique and complementary skills, ever-changing mission parameters that encourage experimentation, and a diverse collection of sand-swept settings to sneak through. Desperados 3 is a Western that’s just as wily as it is wild, and should be firmly in the ironsights of anyone with the appetite for a serious stealth challenge. It’s entirely possible you’re not familiar with the Desperados series, considering the last instalment of the previously PC-only franchise – Desperados 2: Cooper’s Revenge – was released 14 years ago. It matters not, though, since Desperados 3 is a prequel to the original game and thus any prior knowledge of its plot or characters isn’t necessary for newcomers looking to saddle up. Desperados 3’s campaign serves as an origin story for main protagonist John Cooper, who stars in yet another tale of bitter revenge that spills its first blood on the rocks of Colorado and leaves a trail all the way down to the dustiest depths of New Mexico. It’s a violent tour through a series of vibrant and wonderfully detailed frontier settings.  The plot may be more stock standard than an unmodified Winchester, but what makes the 30-hour journey of Desperados 3’s campaign so captivating is the camaraderie shared between its five playable characters. Their contextual banter as you make your way through each murderous mission really helps to define their individual personalities, making for an outlaw gang I was consistently happy to be at the reigns of. An early mission sees two characters make a bet to see who can claim the most scalps, and then with each subsequent kill you can hear them call out their running tallies like Gimli and Legolas in Lord of the Rings, which is just one of numerous nice little touches. Although it admittedly seems a little odd when these back-and-forths continue even when the characters are separated by large stretches of the map, almost as though they’ve been outfitted with walkie talkies by a time-traveling Doc Brown.     All of the action plays out in real-time (this is not an XCOM-style game) but like developer Mimimi Games’ previous stealth-’em-up, 2016’s Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun, it features the ability to pause the action and plot out a sequence of moves for your squad before executing them all at once to make complex simultaneous action possible. Desperados 3 improves on that concept with some welcome extra features such as the ability to chain together a series of moves, like killing an enemy and then carrying and concealing their body, all in one action. Plotting and executing a synchronised attack from all angles so that multiple enemies are taken out and disposed of to clear an area of threats in one fell swoop without raising an alarm is consistently satisfying to perform.  My progress through each Desperados 3 mission demanded more frequent reloading than a single-shot rifle, as I continued to repeatedly botch each enemy encounter until I could come up with an effective plan to attack the guards at the right time, in the right order, using the most appropriate abilities of my team. Certainly, in the midst of Desperados 3’s most challenging enemy outposts I felt like I was trapped in my own personal gunslinging Groundhog Day – but no matter how maddening the more difficult moments became, the sense of accomplishment I felt when I eventually overcame them was always immense. While it wasn’t always clear on my first, second, or umpteenth attempt, there was always a solution to be found to even the most complex of enemy equations, and I never felt like I had to rely on blind luck to get through any of its toughest scenarios. The occasional presence of environmental hazards also provided some welcome assistance, and I relished the moments I was able to indulge in some Agent 47-style underhandedness by dropping a church bell on a target or rigging a buzzsaw blade in a sawmill to literally cut off a well-armed enemy at the knees. Many missions also introduce strategy-altering twists to keep things fresh, such as the map that’s bisected by regular trains that forces you to time your kills on one side of the track when the sentries on the other side have their vision obscured by the passing train carriages.  Desperados 3 is an uncompromising tactical stealth game that tests your patience and rewards your willingness to experiment. Playing with a charming team of toy soldier-sized assassins in a series of deadly and detailed dioramas is tough and requires a lot of trial and error, but success is more rousing than a whiskey chaser. Dormant for 14 years, in Desperados 3 the series enjoys the most triumphant comeback in the Western genre since Clint Eastwood made Unforgiven. "
360,"The Last of Us, Part II - ",10.0,"Its scope and scale won’t challenge Rockstar’s open-world games any time soon, but it shakes up the pacing in a needed way.The Last of Us is one of the rare beloved games of the past decade that not only didn’t demand a sequel, but actively seemed to resist the idea of one. Its story is largely poignant because of how self-contained it is: not knowing what happened between Joel and Ellie after his fateful, final decision burned a mark into the brains of many who played it, and that open-ended question has lingered for years. But with The Last of Us Part 2, developer Naughty Dog rises to that challenge with not only a complex, profound story that gives it a reason to exist, but also deep and satisfying evolutions to the original’s third-person action/stealth gameplay. I can’t tell you much about some of Part 2’s best aspects, but not because I don’t want to – I’m bursting to talk with anyone about all the moving, uplifting, and heart-wrenching moments that have been replaying in my mind for days since I first beat this adventure. But doing so would strip away layers of the act of playing through Part 2 yourself, so I’ll speak about its story in largely general terms.  One of Part 2’s biggest achievements is how it knowingly handles the weighted expectations that a sequel to one of the most heralded game stories of all time will inevitably carry with fans. It starts out seemingly simple, taking place about four years after the end of the original and setting an older, angrier, but still-immune Ellie on a quest for revenge that also hones in on the cycles of violence that can plague humanity as much as any infection. It knowingly leans into the tropes of the genre, such as guilt by association and the inevitable escalation of matching an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But those cliches are often subverted, playing into the expansive and not-so-straightforward path ahead. From there, Ellie’s journey grows into something much more ambitious. Part 2 deftly handles a war on the streets of post-zombie-apocalypse Seattle, an expansive new cast of characters, and some gut-punch payoffs to the lingering emotions The Last of Us’ powerful ending left me stirring over for the last seven years. The Last of Us Part 2’s story is handled as masterfully as it was in the original. One of the most impactful ways Part 2 hearkens back to The Last of Us is how it asks you to identify and empathize with its characters, even when you almost certainly won’t always agree with their actions. In a medium often defined by giving us the power to choose what happens, The Last of Us and Part 2 concern themselves more with fully realized characters, asking us to take them as they are. Naughty Dog’s characters are indelible, which makes for incredibly powerful and challenging moments when you’re put in Ellie's shoes and asked to act out her whims yourself. Part 2 is peppered with brutal, tragic, and poignant moments that hit harder because you take part in them, like it or not. Even if I disagreed with an action, I didn’t have a choice in the matter. I was asked to execute those actions or watch them happen without a chance to intercede, and to understand the reasoning behind them from their perspective. This dance between interactivity and an unalterable story made for a much more affecting experience than if I’d watched it all unfold in a movie.Preorder The Last of Us Part 2 At the heart of it all is Ellie and her relationships. Ellie has had time to both find herself in the Jackson, Wyoming settlement she and her flawed father figure Joel call home and to reflect on the formative moments of her childhood. Uncovering what she knows and where she stands with Joel and his brother Tommy, is, at different times painful, amusing, and cathartic, but always in ways that are true to what I knew of these characters.Actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson once again bring so much heart and honesty in their performances as Joel and Ellie, respectively. Ellie is, without a doubt, the protagonist of Part 2, and Johnson brings nuance to every facet of Ellie’s character. Watching her grow up and wrestle with her past while still learning who she is as a 19-year-old (with all the usual desires and shortfalls 19-year-olds generally possess) is riveting at every step. She delivers some of the most human moments that Part 2 serves up. Baker is no less fantastic as Joel, even though Ellie is in the more prominent playable role. However you may feel about Joel’s decisions in the original, Baker sells the weariness of a man who has taken many lives to save his own and made questionable moral decisions out of love. Seeing him reckon with a surrogate daughter who both cares for him and yet keeps him at arm’s length is devastating to watch. Taking a cue from 2014’s prequel expansion, The Last of Us: Left Behind, Part 2 allowed me to live in moments between Joel and Ellie, which offered up a quiet reflection of why they view the world they do.Even when she does horrible things, her motivations are just as legitimate as Joel's or Ellie's. Part 2 also introduces a great cast of supporting characters. Shannon Woodward is instantly charming as Dina, bringing a joy and kindness to a world where it’s otherwise so tough to find. Woodward shines in the smaller moments — a joking jab at Ellie here or an amusing aside about their Jackson homestead, there — offering so much dimension to the character. It’s also important to highlight, in spoiler-free terms, the incredible performance by Laura Bailey (known for her roles as Mary Jane from Marvel’s Spider-Man and Kait Diaz from Gears 5, among numerous others) as a new character. Like so many of The Last of Us’ characters, calling her good or evil would be reductive – we see her at her best and most relatable as well as her worst. It’s a testament to The Last of Us Part 2’s script by Neil Druckmann and Halley Gross and Bailey’s performance that even when she does horrible things, her motivations are just as legitimate and arguably noble as Joel’s or Ellie’s.It takes a deft hand to write characters like this; those I wanted the best for even if they were doing despicable things. Some of the choices the characters made in Part 2 delighted me, others frustrated me, but I always wanted them to be better, and stronger, and see the goodness in themselves. In this regard, they felt incredibly human. The way Naughty Dog uses the larger, community-based conflict between the warring groups in Seattle also helped avoid the fatigue that set in with the latter acts of Uncharted 4. Even though it took me about 25 hours to complete (10 hours longer than the original), Part 2 never dragged or felt padded out thanks to the large cast and Naughty Dog’s efforts to give each of them the screen time and story arc they deserve. Bringing so many perspectives to the forefront beautifully illustrates the larger ideas and conflicts in this world. Those conflicts play out with some very familiar stealth, action, and puzzle sequences. That said, one of the biggest critiques of the first game is that its combat and puzzle segments weren’t deep enough to avoid repetition over its 15 hours, and Part 2 has taken major steps to remedy that and add variety to gameplay – some of which seem obvious in hindsight. For example, it’s silly to think that adding a jump button in 2020 could feel so fresh, but it most definitely proves to be key to Part 2’s many enthralling combat encounters. Ellie is far more nimble than Joel, able to jump, swing, and climb over and under things to more carefully avoid or stalk enemies. That not only made my options feel exponentially more varied, but also allowed the level design around these encounters to be more open and diverse at every step.From underground caverns to dilapidated office and apartment buildings to the lush, overgrown streets of a Seattle being reclaimed by nature, Part 2’s stealth combat is easy to understand but consistently exciting to try and master with every new fight. Part of that comes from the scope of its battlefields: they take place in areas like multi-tiered shopping malls or fragmented skyscrapers that offer what feel like naturally complex puzzle boxes. There was always plenty of room, both literally and mechanically, to sneak around and pick off enemies one by one, go in guns blazing, or (as usually happened for me) plan to be stealthy but get caught and scramble to narrowly escape danger.Ellie’s ability to jump, go prone, dodge, and even run away from combat not only takes advantage of these large spaces, but also enables that improvisation within them, pushing you to adapt to any situation or meet a quick death. Enemies don’t just stick to set patterns; they’re reactive to the environment around them.While giving every human enemy a name and the ability to communicate with each other more effectively while searching for you seems somewhat superfluous at first, the practical application of it was always clear after I’d killed an enemy or two in any given fight. The Washington Liberation Front enemies, seeing a friend or loved one dead on the ground, would immediately switch up their search pattern, taking note of recently downed enemies and possible escape routes the killer could have taken from that spot. Simply hearing my enemies verbally work through their plans, rather than just going about their patrol routes, instilled so much more tension into every fight.Learning the ins and outs of each faction added another interesting layer to combat. Then there are the differences between the factions – learning the ins and outs of each added another interesting layer to combat. The Seraphites, battling with bows and arrows, use a whistling system to communicate, while the WLF members are more vocal and transparent, but carry a lot more firepower.And the Infected… well, they haven’t suddenly started talking, but their mob mentality is more threatening than ever. New enemies like the Shambler throw noxious spore bombs that cut off potential escape routes or obscure other enemies. The returning but more prevalent Stalkers are even scarier than before, pulling off a move Drax would be jealous of by making themselves invisible to Ellie’s returning radar-like Listen ability. They’ll use that silence to sneak up behind you, and when one attacks, it often means more are on the way. Fights with them, and a mixture of the many other Infected enemies with different abilities to take into account, led to several encounters that rivaled the best survival-horror experiences out there.This is all to say enemies feel vastly more intelligent and varied in this sequel, and the little details make all the difference in combat: when alerted, enemies will check every inch of a map, including under cars and around each bit of cover, and their increased responsiveness to changes in the environment meant I could rarely sit still or rely on just one weapon. I loved that incentive to not only shake up my strategy but also become more familiar with any given area as quickly as possible.I sometimes found myself choosing to be stealthy and non-lethal just to save myself from watching a brutal blow. And yes, despite all of the added nuance, Part 2 has some of the most bluntly brutal combat animations I’ve seen in any game, and it’s never played to a cartoonish degree the way something like Mortal Kombat does. It fits thematically with the tone, Ellie’s revenge-minded focus, and the violence those in power will use to control this post-pandemic society, but that doesn’t make the impact any less gruesome, and occasionally hard to stomach. The most frequent kill I witnessed was Ellie’s stealth takedown: a grab, stab, and slow, clumsy fall to the ground for every enemy I used it on. Shotguns are powerful and scary — just as Ellie can be knocked down, so too can an enemy. Choosing to fight – to graphically cut into an enemy’s throat or blast them against the wall with a shotgun – is tough to stomach in Part 2, intentionally so.And while it certainly reflects the reality of Ellie’s world, and its enemies reflect that character behavior back at you in powerful ways, I did sometimes find myself choosing to be stealthy and non-lethal just to save myself from watching a brutal blow. Avoiding combat entirely is often possible, but it’s rarely easy given how mobile and perceptive enemies are. I often had to sacrifice at least two or three enemies per encounter – especially when enemy dogs who can track Ellie’s scent are thrown into the mix. In The Last of Us Part 2, dogs are a major threat because they can sniff you out even when Ellie’s well-hidden from humans. You can distract them with throwable bottles or bricks, but if you don’t keep moving they’ll inevitably pick your scent back up. As a dog owner, I found it horrifying to be confronted with a situation in which I have to kill a dog (as opposed to a human who’s made a conscious decision to fight you to the death). No, they’re not real, but Naughty Dog has done an amazing job of animating their namesakes in lifelike ways. While you can’t feed treats to or play fetch with the dogs in the middle of battle, if it’s just too much to have to subdue one, I suggest sprinting away for your life. Dogs can pick up your scent, if you’re far enough away they become disinterested in you until they eventually amble closer to you on the map. Heights are your friend as well because, unlike Air Bud, there’s something in the Last of Us rulebook about dogs not being allowed to climb ladders. I often used those techniques to avoid watching Ellie do something I never could.Part 2’s expansive environments aren’t just there to be sandboxes of death, though. The artfully detailed and realized locations tell layers of story, from the macro-destruction of a certain city district down to the posters and calendars hung on abandoned apartment walls. Some of the original Last of Us’ most interesting bits of backstory were found in scattered notes and diary pages, and the jump in detail for Part 2 astounded me. It seems as though every room has a story to tell, every office has a history, every store shows a place or group of people frozen in time. I spent more time than I’d care to admit studying abandoned D&amp;D games in apartments, listening to ancillary conversations, and trying to read deteriorating book covers. Whether I found equipment and crafting materials or not, the thoughtful intent in each one of these objects and interactions made exploring feel valuable regardless.I never once had to grab a floating palette to serve as a raft for someone who couldn’t swim. Even better is that I never once had to navigate these areas by grabbing a floating palette to serve as a raft for someone who couldn’t swim, like the original so often asked us to do. Part 2’s environmental puzzles never feel as mindless as that – they have a lot more contextual challenges that make smart use of Ellie’s journey through skyscrapers, residential neighborhoods, sewers, plains, and more. From figuring out how to angle a rope to swing from one office to another locked room to navigating a perilous series of tripwires using Ellie’s new mobility to many more everyday tasks that take on new tension in a post-apocalypse setting, Part 2 makes much better use of its environment to offer unique, consistently engaging puzzles and platforming routes. And those clever designs are dressed with some of the most beautiful environments I’ve seen from the PlayStation 4/PlayStation 4 Pro generation. And while Part 2 is not an open-world game, it does include an open-world area that learns lessons from Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy’s attempts at the same design idea, this time to much better effect. While those games presented areas of open, explorable wildernesses, they often didn’t have much to find there, making exploration feel somewhat aimless. In Part 2, though, a dilapidated district of Seattle offers years of lost history, a mixture of events frozen in time by the pandemic and those who have tried to survive here since. Its scope and scale won’t challenge Rockstar’s open-world games any time soon, but it shakes up the pacing in a needed way and is thoughtfully used by Naughty Dog to not only explain Part 2’s setting at large, but also allow for a number of welcome, discoverable character moments.Its scope and scale won’t challenge Rockstar’s open-world games any time soon, but it shakes up the pacing in a needed way. But even outside of that area, Jackson, other parts of Seattle, and more are gorgeous and memorable locations. The Wyoming countryside is lovely, too, whether it be mountains covered in bright snow or fields of wheat shining in the evening sunset. And sure, the Pacific Northwest is as rainy as you would expect, but Naughty Dog has taken the gloom of grey clouds and grey buildings and crafted something ominous, beautiful, and haunting. Lush vegetation grows over dilapidated storefronts and homes in the suburbs while the smashed, looming skyscrapers of the city form new, mesmerizing stone monuments. Seven years and a new generation has allowed Naughty Dog to create locations that, while very much like the ruined vestiges of civilization in the original, are so much more richly detailed, with more distinct and varied interiors, striking outdoor lighting, and inventive new locations that play to Seattle’s seaside setting. Evocative audio design, backed by the moving score of returning composer Gustavo Santaolalla, plays a big role as well. It all comes down to the little details: characteristically for the region, the oppressive thump of rain masks the terrifying noises of the infected that lurk outside; the slam of debris that blocks a doorway and the quiet creaking of an alternative exit; the slight hum of a silenced pistol versus the harrowing boom of a shotgun; and vocal performances from the guttural screams of the Clickers to the muttered self-reflection from Ellie as she kills an enemy. Naughty Dog has introduced dozens of new accessibility options for The Last of Us Part 2, which go far beyond just full control customization and text font size changes. A variety of visual, audio, motion sickness, and control settings can be tweaked (check out the full options here), and some can even be turned off and on once activated with simple and smartly integrated swipes of the DualShock 4’s touchpad. As someone who does not necessarily need these options to play I can’t speak to their efficacy, but they’re impressively extensive on paper and their ease of use and customizability is certainly on a level I haven’t seen from Sony before. I hope this is a sign of things to come as we move into the PlayStation 5 generation. The Last of Us Part 2 is a masterpiece worthy of its predecessor. Taking strides forward in nearly every way, Ellie steps into the spotlight and carries the sequel in a manner that feels like the culmination of everything that’s made Naughty Dog’s blockbuster storytelling so memorable since the original Uncharted on the PlayStation 3. It delivers a layered, emotionally shattering story on top of stealth and action gameplay that improves the first game’s mechanics while integrating a bit more of Uncharted’s greater mobility and action. But while Part 2 is a thrilling adventure, it still makes time for a stunning, nuanced exploration of the strength and fragility of the human spirit. The PlayStation 4 has one of its best exclusives in one of the generation’s best games. "
361,Disintegration Single-Player ,6.0, Robots blasting and bashing each other to bits is a concept near and dear to my heart, and on that level Disintegration’s single-player campaign delivers. Its creative approach to first-person shooting is also intriguing, since it has you floating above the action and calling the shots for a team of bots on the ground while firing away. But it’s not as smart as it looks, and what seemed like it could get interesting and tactical never really did.      There are a few “Wha?” moments from the opening minutes I have to call out: first, Romer knocks an evil robot unconscious by whacking him in the back of the head with a wrench. I… don’t think that’s how robots work? A short time later, 12-foot-tall robot hulk Doyle backs down from attempting to intimidate a human who points out Doyle’s gun isn’t loaded, as though Doyle couldn’t literally squish this guy between his robo-toes like jam. It settles down after that but these eyebrow-raising moments set a strange tone for the rest of the story.   To Disintegration’s credit, blasting enemy robots like Star Wars’ battle droids is a fair amount of fun for a while. Not because their AI is especially good or anything, but because rather than literally disintegrating when you kill them they explode into chunks in a satisfying way, sending pieces flying. That’s one thing Disintegration does better than most games: your guns will tear apart the environment in a pretty dramatic fashion, reducing wood to splinters and even shattering concrete barriers that enemies were using as cover. It’s not Red Faction or anything, since most of the environment is invulnerable, but this level of destructibility definitely makes the weapons and explosions feel powerful and look cool. And yet, combat gets stale pretty quickly because even though this is a squad-based game where you get a bird’s eye view of the battlefield, Disintegration isn’t tactical at all. Where something like Mass Effect allows you to tell each unit where to go and what abilities to use when they get there, this is more like directing a mob. You can’t tell your Iron Giant-style hulk buddy to play Rock’em Sock’em Robots with the big guys while the more agile soldiers take on the fodder because there’s only one “everybody attack this target” or “open that box” button and they all act as one. It’s very simple and one-note.   You have to keep your team alive to use them, though, and also so they can absorb all the enemy fire that your fragile flying gravcycle can’t. Depending on what gear you’re given for a mission, that can be tricky to do – for instance, if you don’t have any healing abilities and have to rely on pickups from certain enemy types or healing stations your crew can activate for you. But of course, if one of your bots goes down, all you have to do is retrieve their head and they’ll rocket back onto the field a few seconds later in a shiny new body, so you don’t need to sweat it much if they explode. It’s important to keep them on the field to give the bad guys something else to shoot at, and there’s a 30-second timer that will end the mission if you don’t retrieve a head, but the stakes are largely pretty low.  Then there are the boss battles, which look and sound great but are usually pretty weak. They boil down to shooting the giant four-legged Thunderhead walker (while dodging its slow-moving projectiles) until it goes down, then getting right up in its armpit – and I mean all the way up in its armpit – and hovering there while you hold down the fire button until each of four weak points explodes. It only got a little challenging when I had to deal with two at once, but the vast majority of these fights after the first one were painfully dull. What’s especially frustrating about Disintegration’s campaign is that even though there’s a whole area you walk around between missions where you can talk to your crew, you have zero control over your squad composition or your vehicle’s loadout. Every mission dictates all of that to you, and all you get to do is pump in a few upgrade points for boring but necessary stat boosts to weapons, cooldown reductions, and things like that. I get that I’m being walked through different roles I’ll need to know for multiplayer, like the healer and the sniper, but it’s a bit annoying to have things like how you heal yourself change from level to level and not being able to pick a favorite gun or robot and develop it. That lack of continuity made levels feel like a string of unrelated battles, and practically kills replayability because I can’t return to a mission and play it with a different style of gravcycle and squad. Having no customization seems like a really poor design choice. Flying around and giving orders to cool-looking robots is a neat concept, but the simple shooting and squad management of Disintegration’s single-player campaign make it fall pretty flat after a while. The surprising lack of customization and progression make the battles feel disconnected outside of the story, which has some decent characters but is otherwise a pretty straightforward rebellion against evil robot overlords. "
362,Deep Rock Galactic ,9.0,"The dwarves are at it again. The fictional race famous for their stubbornness, belligerence (particularly after a few drinks), and for digging too greedily, and too deep, do precisely that in Deep Rock Galactic, the first game from Danish developer Ghost Ship Games. You play as a member of a dwarven deep space mining expedition. With either an NPC robot sidekick or up to four other players, you explore pitch-black caverns in search of valuable minerals and flora, and blast through swarms of monsters on your way out. That’s the core game. Go on mining missions, bring back loot, use the loot to upgrade your equipment, go on more dangerous missions, bring back more loot, upgrade further, and so on. It’s a classic grind: you toil in the mines only for a chance to toil some more – and earn cosmetic upgrades to show off to a pick-up group of random miners you mine better than they do.  ‘Games as a service’ have always had a strange relationship to players, and the work they put into a game. Despite what the word ‘service’ suggests, from the start ‘games as a service’ have been about monopolizing your time and monetizing your in-game labor for their own gain. The ‘service’ part mostly means providing you with (barely) enough content to keep you engaged for a prolonged period of time. While Deep Rock Galactic does center around a slow, repetitive progression system typical of ‘games as a service’, it forgoes microtransactions with real world money: all of your progression is earned by playing. Yet, no matter how wealthy or experienced you get, you’re never allowed to transcend or escape the grind. Like an early Roman soldier, your wealth and status might decide what kind of weapons and armor you can afford to bring to a battle. But everyone dies the same. (There’s an option to ‘retire’ your dwarf, resetting its experience, starting the grind all over again.) But Deep Rock Galactic is refreshingly upfront about its relationship with its players. It’s a fantasy about work, about hard labor in deadly hazardous conditions. Your dwarves are freelance miners for a faceless company that cares more about retrieving its mining equipment than the safety of its workers. Each member of your online crew only gets a tiny cabin to live in. The common room has an in-game store and workbenches to upgrade your gear. It also has a bar, a jukebox and a mini-game where you throw barrels through a hoop. It ’s a typical romantic fantasy of blue-collar work: after a hard yet rewarding day’s work, you bro down with your fellow dwarves and down some brewskis. It’s also somewhat disconcerting that the dwarves proudly proclaim themselves to be predisposed to exactly this kind of labor, as if some are just meant to work, off of which others are naturally born to profit. (It certainly doesn’t help that Deep Rock Galactic’s dwarves are particularly and stereotypically boisterous.) But it’s easy to look past its ironically dystopian window-dressing, because most of all Deep Rock Galactic is a lot of fun. The underground caverns are full of atmosphere. Navigating them feels smooth and is hardly ever a chore. Particularly while climbing the game tends to give you the benefit of the doubt, and allows you to clamber up on ledges you might’ve thought were too far away to reach.  Its rough polygonal design is not only endearing, it also makes it easy to distinguish which terrain features are pertinent and valuable, and which aren’t. The underground environments burst with flavor. Its tunnels feel appropriately claustrophobic, while larger caverns do inspire awe – especially because they’re only ever sparsely lit up by flares, flashlights or the occasional luminescent fungi or geothermal activity. Light matters: without it, it’s difficult to spot veins, especially those high up and in hard to reach places. While a true lack of light is rarely ever a big issue, in co-op games, only the Scout class has access to a flare launcher that lights up nearly an entire chamber. It’s one of the multiple ways the different classes depend on each other. As the colorful caverns are lit up by equally colorful lights, it’s hard to not be charmed by how gorgeous Deep Rock Galactic can be. Not being able to easily oversee an entire chamber adds to the tension when seemingly endless swarms of giant, burrowing insects keep crawling from the darkness on your position. Luckily, gunfighting feels satisfying. Each class has access to a different array of guns, from lighter fare like sawn-off shotguns to heavier equipment like gun turrets and miniguns. Especially with weapons with smaller clip sizes, having to reload is hectic, no matter how smoothly or quickly you do it. Only swinging your pickaxe to collect minerals and clear tunnels feels slightly monotonous, especially as you invest more time into the game. Then there are other class-specific abilities, like being able to create floating platforms or mechanical zip-lines for easier navigations, of which all players can enjoy the benefits. As resource gathering is shared, and players can revive each other in combat, Deep Rock Galactic thoroughly encourages teamwork. Deep Rock Galactic is the best kind of four-player co-op game. The combat is fast and exciting, with tons of interesting synergies to find between the four distinct playable classes. The objectives on the various missions are wide-ranging enough to keep things interesting, but straightforward enough that a new player could drop in and get the hang of it pretty quickly. You can absolutely have a blast and find success with a level-one, un-upgraded dwarf, but there’s tons of room to develop your skills and customize your look if you’re willing to put in the time. Raise a tankard! This one’s a winner. "
363,Valorant ,9.0, Nail-biting bomb plants, hip fire headshots, and hypernatural flicks of the wrist are the tenets of Valorant. This 5v5 tactical hero shooter by League of Legends developer Riot Games had a stranglehold on me from my first carefully strategized victory. Now, after clocking 90 hours between the closed beta and the full release, I'm still utterly enamored with the brilliant implementation of its superpowered cast and stellar gunplay. The learning curve is steep, but once the cogs of mastery clicked together, it became damn near impossible for me to put Valorant down. If you've ever indulged in a little Counter-Strike (or, in my case, a lot) at some point over the past two decades, Valorant's high-stakes round-based shootouts will be immediately familiar. Teams take turns as either the attackers or defenders in a best-of-25 rounds. Attackers carry the spike (a bomb) to one of several designated bombsites on Valorant’s 3 finely tuned maps, plant that sucker, and hopefully blow everyone sky-high. Meanwhile, the defenders must thwart the attacker's explody-ambitions by defusing the spike once it's planted or stopping the plant altogether. Of course, you could also just mow down the enemy team to secure victory, whatever works! The back-and-forth race to that coveted 13th victory is as pulse-pounding as it is gratifying.   While thunderous, Overwatch-style ultimate abilities in a reserved tactical shooter might raise an eyebrow, the time-to-kill in Valorant remains extraordinarily low: a single, well-placed bullet can spell your end. It creates a spectacular sense of tension, encouraging scenarios where the rattle of distant gunfire sends chills down your spine even as flashy abilities are being popped. When hellfire rains from the sky, it’s a sign that Brimstone is only a hop and a skip away, so best get out of the way no matter how pinned-down you might be. During my first few matches, I worried that ults might hurt that on-edge atmosphere and homogenize strategy to be all about their timing and use. Thankfully, those concerns were unwarranted, because Valorant balances ults by making them cost points instead of attaching them to a cooldown timer. You gain these points by dying, collecting static resource nodes, and, most importantly: killing opponents. Burning an ult means drying up yet another precious resource, so I spent them tactfully. On top of that, you need to choose which lesser abilities to buy into as well. I'm no stranger to perusing a weapons catalog at the start of each round, carefully mulling over whether I should buy a fancy machine gun or hold off and save my hard-earned cash for later in the match. What's new to me, though, is how Valorant cleverly injects some hero shooter DNA into the buy phase by making the two or three unique abilities (it varies per character) of its 11 playable Agents purchasable rather than only available on cooldowns. It takes time to get into Valorant's rhythm, particularly if you're not used to micromanaging an in-game economy in an FPS, but there’s a layer of tactical depth here that typical hero-based shooters don’t have.  My go-to Agent is Sage, a combat medic with elemental frost powers. She has a barrier orb that walls off entrances and a slow orb that covers a portion of the ground in sheets of ice, but I have to fork over money I earn from kills and winning rounds to use them. If you want to maximize an Agent's combat potential, then you'd better know how to budget abilities along with guns – especially considering that you’re stuck with whatever Agent you chose at the start of a match the whole way through. Thankfully, it’s not a big deal if their toolkit isn’t to your liking since Agents don’t fit into the hard tank, healer, and DPS roles that are so common in hero shooters. ""There are two attackers left, and they're rotating from bombsite A towards B,"" my teammate warned over voice chat. ""I'll flank, hold them off until then."" My heart began to race. I was defending bombsite B by myself, and it was going to take some crafty deployment of Sage's toolkit to make sure I didn't push up any daisies. So I quickly threw up an ice wall, blocking off the choke point to my right. If they wanted to get past, they'd have to blow my wall apart – giving away their position. I crouched in a corner with my rifle trained at the bombsite's second entrance to the left, anxiously awaiting the pitter-patter of footsteps. Then I heard some, and immediately tossed Sage's slow orb in their direction. With the ground covered in ice, I took a peek to see if I'd caught anyone in my icy snare – and I did! It was Raze, a demolition expert with an itchy trigger finger, and she was already midway through tossing her grenade ability in my direction. I quickly fired a three-round burst at her, with the final bullet hitting her between eyes, and a lava lamp-styled blood pattern erupted from her skull. It was a thrilling exchange, but there was no time to celebrate. ""Nowhere to run,"" shouted Sova, a valiant archer, from behind Raze's corpse. That shout signified his ult, and he began launching massive energy-infused arrows in my direction. Luckily, my teammate finally arrived with his flanking maneuver and managed to snipe Sova from behind, saving my butt. Every match is a rush packed with strategic back-and-forths like this, and the hero-shooter tinge only increases the tension in the best way. It also helps that Valorant's minimalist art style is tailor-made for combat readability in matches. Every visual cue, from a simple muzzle flash to an elaborate ult, is instantly recognizable thanks to the clearly defined art. When Sage throws her slow orb, it flies through the air with a bright blue sheen, contrasting well with the brown cobblestone of walls found in most maps. Not even chaotic firefights will downplay an orb's luster because of the emphasis on a less-is-more color palette. While I'm not a fan of the uninspired character designs and flat particle effects on their own, everything comes together in a way that makes engagements easy to understand from a visual standpoint, and I love that.  My adoration for Valorant's hero-shooter elements only grew as I discovered all the tactical wiggle-room born from the synergy between its cast's supernatural powers. I love deploying an old-fashioned bamboozle, especially the sort that involves flanking the enemy team. Omen, a spectral assassin that's particularly fond of edgy quips, just so happens to be well-versed in the art of skirting. In a particularly dicey match as Omen, myself and a friend were all that remained of our attacking team, with four defenders still on their feet. We had just planted the spike, and the defenders weren't happy about it, furiously storming the bomb site from a single choke-point. My friend was Viper, a narcissistic chemical-warfare expert. She tossed an acid grenade, landing at their feet, temporarily slowing the advance. I placed Omen's Dark Cover ability on the right side the choke-point, creating a visibility-smearing cloud of smoke. They deduced that I must've been to the right as well, blindly firing in that direction in hopes of tagging me while soaking up the acid's corrosive damage in the process. Unfortunately for them, I popped Omen's From The Shadows ultimate, which allowed me to teleport to their flank. With the defenders startled and sandwiched between us, my friend and I took them out in a symphony of bullets. Coordinating and executing sophisticated strategies with my friends accounted for at least half the fun I had in Valorant, which makes its region locked servers a bummer. If you're in North America, for example, there's no option to play with folks from abroad. I've got friends in the UK and Puerto Rico that I'd love to plant spikes with, but we're just out of luck. No doubt this is part of Riot's commitment to low-latency servers, but it'd be nice if you could opt into some that let you play with whomever from wherever.  Valorant is free-to-play with a wealth of cosmetics to unlock, but most are only attainable by swiping your credit card. Stuff like gun skins, spray paint tags, stylized particle effects for gunfire, finishers, alternative sound effects for weapons, and little decorative gun charms called buddies are all available via the in-game store. You'll need to buy Valorant Points, an in-game currency only obtainable with real money, for the best goodies in particular. Valorant Points come in several bundles: 475 for $4.99, 1000 for $9.99, 2050 for $19.99, 3650 for $34.99, 5350 for $49.99, and 11000 for $99.99. Thankfully, none of the in-game purchases are of the pay-to-win sort. Not all of the cosmetics require real money thanks to the Battlepass. It contains all kinds of unique items like those mentioned above, and everyone gets access to the base version of it for free. While there's a premium upgrade available for 1000 Valorant Points, it only adds a small handful of additional rewards and primarily just levels up your Battlepass more quickly. If you complete the weekly challenges and earn experience, you can unlock nearly all the same stuff. Unfortunately, not every Agent is available from the get-go. While five of its 11 are available to all players by default and you are able to choose two more to unlock for free soon after you start playing, the rest must be unlocked through their Contracts – a progression system filled with rewards related to each Agent. The Agents themselves unlock at the 5th tier of their Contract, so you either have to earn enough experience through playing to finally get access to them or spend Valorant Points to unlock them immediately. Aside from the Agents, I've never felt compelled to spend money on Valorant, nor would doing so buy me any competitive edge.  Thankfully, no matter who you’re playing with, all the dazzling magic in the world won't carry the team if you can't aim well. Each of the 17 guns at your disposal in Valorant has an elaborate and unique recoil pattern. I spent several hours at the in-game firing range, shooting away at practice dummies and trying to hone the finesse required to properly wield my favorite firearms. For example, the Vandal assault rifle sways from left to right if you unload a full clip in one go. It only takes a shot or two to the head from the Vandal to kill an opponent, so spraying and praying is not only a waste of ammo, but all the noise from a booming automatic rifle will give away your position, too. Bullets will also fly all over the place if you try to shoot while moving. It was a fun challenge to learn how to plant my feet quickly, take a few burst shots, and then proceed. The ferocious Operator sniper rifle requires a solid step too; however, it doesn't care that its deafening slugs will shake your headphones. It's the most expensive gun for a good reason: take a shot to the head or torso from this beast, and you'll be eating dirt even while sporting heavy armor. The risk-reward balance of buying either the Operator or the Vandal is what I love about the economy in Valorant. The former will down your quarry in one blow, but the expensive buy-in and slow reload time make it a gamble to purchase. While the latter is a workhorse: semi-automatic, useful at any range, cheaper, but the recoil makes it tougher to control. Learning the ins-and-outs of each weapon in Valorant is a game in and of itself. My first couple of matches were the marksmen's equivalent of The Comedy of Errors, and I had to consciously remind myself that getting good at Valorant would take a lot of practice. So between matches, I'd plug more time into the training mode, tapping into rules of carefully placed hip fire that Counter-Strike taught me. Hints of brilliance would flash before my eyes whenever I snapped the enemy's neck back with an exquisite headshot, always rewarded by a beautiful musical sting. That steadily happened more often, and seeing the fruits of my labor pay off in actual matches was tremendously satisfying. Valorant is a game for the FPS fan who craves a daunting competitive challenge, no matter how much of a pummelling you have to take along the way. Valorant is the most fun I've had with a multiplayer FPS since Valve's Team Fortress 2. The flexibility of its magically-infused cast paired with a deep arsenal makes for a magnificent competitive canvas, if a tricky one to initially pick up. I'm already pondering new strategies to pull off with my friends in the future, and that joyous daydreaming won't stop anytime soon. It may not be the prettiest modern FPS around, but its visual simplicity enables excellent clarity in every fight. With its teeth sunk in this deep, Valorant makes me want to keep playing until there's nothing left to master. "
364,The Elder Scrolls Online: Greymoor ,6.0, By the time December rolls around, a full decade will have passed since Bethesda first awed us with the announcement of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, which is considered one of the greatest sandbox RPGs of all time (if not for its depth or its main quest, then for the openness and flexibility of its world). The Elder Scrolls Online returns again to that frosty, Viking-esque province with its new Greymoor expansion, and it's... just fine. Its quests and setting are appetizing enough if you like your Nordic-themed fantasy served with a gooey side of vampires, but I never shook the feeling that ZeniMax Online's latest dish left the kitchen a tad too early. Greymoor is certainly beautiful, to its credit. It's set in Skyrim's dreary, marshy northwestern corner, which nevertheless manages to show how far ESO’s graphics have come since we saw the eastern half of the region at launch back in 2014. The centerpiece is Solitude, a city that extends over a rocky arch and makes a good subject for screenshots (and which makes me wonder about the property value of the plots directly above the precarious gap). Unfortunately, the potential for creativity gets mired in the drive for nostalgia. Maybe we can accept that the fortress city of Solitude looks exactly the same despite this story being 800 years before Skyrim, but nearby Morthal is also still just a handful of shacks beside a swamp. Surely there would have been some differences in that span of time, just to make it distinctive?  Fortunately for anyone wanting a bit of visual variety, Western Skyrim takes up only a little more than half of Greymoor's new playable area. The rest of it unfolds in Blackreach: a gorgeous, sprawling (yet labyrinthine) zone with glowing mushrooms the size of redwoods and gothic-inspired castles that reach as high as skyscrapers. Blackreach isn't a new thing; it, too, saw some screen time in Skyrim, but never on so remarkable a scale as this. As with excellent ESO DLCs like Murkmire, it's a reminder of what wonders ZeniMax can achieve when it's freed from the bonds of the past (or the future?), and I wish we could have seen more of that. The drive to pay homage to Skyrim, in fact, may be at least part of the reason why the story falls a little flat. You'll find no dragons here (although you will find the dragon shrines), but Greymoor does recall the single-player adventure through a vampire-heavy story that riffs a bit on 2012's memorable Dawnguard expansion. As in Dawnguard, you'll even get a vampire companion who tags along on a lot of quests, although Greymoor's Fennorian is never quite so memorable as Dawnguard's Serana. Occasionally, the tale delivers moving moments, and Jennifer Hale's usual excellent voice acting in the role of the hero Lyris Titanborn does help make up for some of the weaker moments. On the whole, though, it's a predictable and brief storyline that feels a little too similar to last year's Elsweyr expansion in its broad strokes. The main bad guy barely gets any screen time at all. The side quests are a bit of an improvement, but even they never hit the same high notes we've seen in the last few chapters like Summerset and Morrowind. Considering this is Skyrim we're talking about, I was expecting a little more than just ""okay."" The story is also the basis for the random ""harrowstorms"" dotting the landscape of Western Skyrim and Blackreach, which are basically spots of unpleasant weather which turn the inhabitants into mindless husks or fast-moving zombies in the vein of 28 Days Later. The storms look cool, but in practice, they're merely another variation on the dark anchors, abyssal geysers, and dragons we've seen in previous chapters—and for that matter, the loot is so pitiful that they're mainly worth doing for XP.  Also, it's a shame that wayshrines for quick travel feel inconveniently placed for harrowstorms and that Greymoor doesn't mark the events on the map as Elsweyr did with dragons. You'll find a sense of familiarity creeping throughout the rest of Greymoor, too. This is not a chapter to play if you've been wanting a massive overhaul of the now-familiar ESO experience we've known since 2016's One Tamriel, which did wonders to reinvigorate the game after its rocky launch but is now starting to lose some of its novelty. So in addition to the familiar harrowstorms, completing Greymoor’s full range of content consists of venturing into six soloable dungeons called delves, two public dungeons that offer a little more challenge (and good grinding spots), beating six world bosses, hunting down skill shards for more skill points, and – for high-end players – a new raid-like trial. The trial aside, that's roughly 15 to 20 hours. If you're new to ESO and you simply want to visit Skyrim again, I recommend it for how this familiar design allows you to drop straight into the new content. In MMORPGs like Final Fantasy XIV, by comparison, getting to the new good stuff typically involves a slog through older and often interior adventures. But there is at least one genuinely new feature, and it's one I expect will be remarkably beneficial for new players. I speak of the new ""Antiquities"" system, which comes with two skill lines and bears a superficial resemblance to World of Warcraft's archaeology profession. Despite the similarities between the two concepts, the relative complexity of the minigames makes ESO's antiquities far more entertaining than WoW's version, even though it, too, quickly devolves into a grind if you want to get the most out of it. The first half consists of a ""scrying"" minigame to minimize the number of dig sites on a zone's map you have to visit to find an artifact, while the second half makes you dig in the dirt with everything from brushes to shovels for the actual items, with the difficulty finding the relic before the stamina bar runs out increasing with the quality of the relic. The ostensible appeal of the Antiquities system lies in the way it lets you dig up everything from cosmetic items to a mount and the new batch of rare ""mythic"" gear, but I especially welcome it because it's a good way for casual players to make a decent pile of cash. Prior to this, making good money in ESO tended to involve joining a trading guild for the privilege of using an auction house NPC, but Antiquities artifacts sell to vendors for anywhere from 250 gold to 5,000. That's good walking-around money, and a lot more than you'll get from stealing random junk. The process of leveling alone made me rich enough to properly furnish my player house, which I'd previously given up on because I couldn't keep up with the dues demanded by my trading guild. In keeping with the theme of the expansion, the release of Greymoor also introduced the first big overhaul to the vampire skill line since launch. It's essentially what we get in place of a new class. This isn't a strictly Greymoor feature, though, as any players with vampirism get the changes regardless of whether they have the expansion or not. Feeding is a lot more fun now, as there's a surprisingly wide range of animations for the moments when you sink your teeth into hapless bandits. But playing a vampire also comes at a higher cost now: skills cost more resources and enemies do a lot more damage to you the more powerful you are, and then a lot of NPCs won't interact with you if you're at the highest stage. The only way to get rid of it is to wait it out for a few hours or to grab a potion that isn't always easy to find. I’m personally enjoying the changes, but I can see how some previously viable playstyles like vampire tanking aren’t going to cut it going forward. Speaking of waiting, you might want to give Greymoor a little more time to settle before joining in. The Skyrim name is such a popular draw that Zenimax appeared totally unprepared for demand, resulting in massive server lag for the first couple of days and pings that shot up past 900 and made common animations take around a minute. That's better now after a weekend patch, but Greymoor remains plagued by plenty of other bugs, including a particularly nasty one that makes some enemies in delves totally untargetable and invulnerable to attacks. I had fun in Greymoor. I actually gasped the first time I saw Blackreach open before me, and I don't think any landscapes in Summerset or Elsweyr ever led me to do that. Even so, some of the magic feels missing from this expansion. It's beautiful yet a bit hollow, sort of like Blackreach itself. Maybe this weakness has something to do with the fact that ZeniMax had to do many of the final touches while working from home, but even so, considering what a powerful hand ZeniMax holds with Skyrim, I expected more. It's clearly aware of that nostalgia value, as it still hasn't released southern or northern Skyrim and cities like Markarth and Whiterun, as if it's holding them back for a rainy day. And when those zones arrive—maybe around the time of the true 10-year anniversary of Skyrim—here's to hoping that they leave a shout echoing through gaming history, much as Skyrim itself did. If you love gorgeous, nostalgic landscapes above all else, The Elder Scrolls Online's new Greymoor expansion offers a strongly nostalgic return to the northwestern corner of Skyrim. The formulaic story isn't as compelling, but it's at least buoyed by a couple of standout characters. The rest of Greymoor is largely a variation on the familiar ESO formula, although a new ""Antiquities"" system introduces a welcome new way to earn cash, gear, and cosmetic items. "
365,Those Who Remain ,6.0, Many of us have felt afraid of the dark at some point in our lives, but Those Who Remain takes that irrational phobia and imbues it with some tangible menace. A creepy psychological thriller that will kill you should you so much as set one foot into its shadows, Those Who Remain forces you to seek solace under streetlights and puzzle your way to illuminate new paths through your shady surroundings, sort of like the inverse of a standard stealth game design. It’s an intriguing horror premise that Those Who Remain uses in some fairly creative ways, but control shortcomings and a disjointed flow to its narrative prevent it from being a consistent thrill for its full six-hour duration.   Those Who Remain cultivates an ominous ambience, with each location you visit shrouded in a darkness that’s only pierced by the glowing blue eyes of the malevolent silhouettes that lurk within it. The first few times I flicked a light switch on and off and watched a horde of stationary shadow people blink in and out of existence was certainly a chilling sight to behold. A number of other neat tricks are successfully employed by Those Who Remain to perpetuate that sense of unease, creating panic with PT-esque infinite hallway loops or diverting your attention one way so that it can sneakily reshuffle the landscape behind you so that new paths, characters, or objects appear where they weren’t just seconds before, to keep you on your toes. Additionally, Edward makes regular trips into a parallel world reminiscent of Stranger Things’ ‘Upside Down’, which he can use to reach areas and interact with objects that he can’t otherwise under the constraints of reality. It quite literally adds an extra dimension to puzzle solving.  Not everything works as effectively as it should, though, and that leads to frustratingly regular checkpoint restarts. Those Who Remain features a pretty streamlined control setup, so it's particularly galling that its main interactions frequently fall down due to their inherent fiddliness. Clearing a room of dark-dwelling demons is as easy as flicking a light switch, or at least it is in theory. In practice, inching through a doorway sideways while waving the reticule over the switch in an attempt to make the hand prompt appear all too often ends in an instant death as you accidently nudge a toe into the black and become consumed by the murderous mob. To make matters worse, light switches have a glowing red LED whether they’re on or off, so it’s not always clear whether they need to be flicked or not. At a handful of junctions throughout the story and at the behest of a mysterious masked stranger, Edward must gather evidence to either forgive or condemn a Dormant resident who’s trapped in purgatory for a crime they’ve committed. According to the developers, the half-dozen or so fates you determine along the way contributes directly to which one of three story endings you receive; however, in practice I played through Those Who Remain twice, making an opposing series of decisions – one totally benevolent, the other wrathful – and both times I ended up with the exact same total bummer of an outcome. I’m not sure if it was a bug specific to me or a general fault with Those Who Remain – perhaps appropriately, I’m still completely in the dark – but I’m certainly not compelled to play through again to find out if the third time’s a charm. dir=""ltr""  The difference in quality between Those Who Remain’s environments and its characters is just as discordant. While the lighting is certainly striking, from flickering neon signs to moody, moonlit corn fields, the human characters you meet along the way are unnatural-looking mud people, which makes them somewhat hard to empathise with. The mediocre quality of the supporting cast’s voice acting only makes it all the more challenging to completely invest in their fates.  Those Who Remain features an eerie atmosphere, inventive puzzles, and some moments of genuine tension via its shape-shifting world, but fussy controls, one-dimensional stealth, and a narrative that lacks cohesion prevent it from stepping completely out of the darkness and into the spotlight. "
366,Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath ,7.0, Hitting more than a year after launch, the big patch that coincided with the release of Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath is exactly the kind of shot in the arm that MK11 needs to keep going strong in its second year. There are new stages, Friendships for every character, a plethora of big-time balance changes that shake up the meta, stage fatalities, quality of life improvements, and more.   Aftermath’s campaign picks up right where Mortal Kombat 11 leaves off and takes us on a predictable but enjoyable and action-packed side-story that inserts all of the non-guest DLC characters.    Apart from Tagawa’s performance, everything else is business as usual for a NetherRealm story mode, with the exception of it being over in just about three hours or so. There’s tons of well-choreographed fight scenes, smart integration of gameplay that forces you to learn characters you might not otherwise play, and a couple of head-scratching moments of questionable logic as Shang Tsung, Nightwolf, and Fujin attempt to pull off a time-travel heist. Still, if you’re able to turn your brain off and just enjoy the ride it takes you on, Aftermath’s campaign is a good time for as long as it lasts. RoboCop is no doubt the most prolific of the pack, but unfortunately, he’s also the least interesting fighter. His basic moveset feels very plain, just about every special move he has feels like it’s been done before, and overall his playstyle just isn’t one that’s very fun to play. That said, he’s an extremely effective zoner, with what is probably the best low projectile in MK11, so if you like characters that hang back and bombard your opponents with a constant barrage of bullets, bombs, and missiles, RoboCop was custom made for you.   In stark contrast to RoboCop, virtually everything that Fujin does is completely unique to him, which makes him a very strange and exciting, if slightly unwieldy, character. Nothing about him is conventional, from his ability to run on air, to his weird launching tornado that requires you to actually manually direct it, to his unique slide that can be used to slip under projectiles and either start a combo or hit with an extremely satisfying krushing blow. It’s kind of a bummer that currently the only way to get any of them is to buy the $40 Aftermath package, whereas all of the other DLC characters are available for $6 a piece. Hopefully somewhere down the line, NetherRealm will offer the option to buy these characters a la carte, or at the very least as a part of a new reasonably priced kombat pack seperate from the Aftermath campaign, because.Sheeva and Fujin especially are great additions to the roster. Even RoboCop, despite being a bit boring to play, is still fun to see in action. Aftermath feels like two disparate DLC packs fused together into one: A short but sweet single-player expansion with a scene-stealing Shang Tsung and half of a Kombat Pack worth of characters. Two of those three, Fujin and Sheeva, are excellent, distinctive fighters while RoboCop is just okay due to his derivative moveset. (He looks and sounds awesome, at least.) Alone and appropriately priced, these two pieces of DLC would be great; bundled together at a steep $40, though, Aftermath is a harder recommendation. "
367,Crucible ,4.0, Crucible plucks popular staples from all over esports, attempting to forge a greater whole through the fires of interstellar warfare. This sci-fi multiplayer third-person shooter is a battle royale at one moment, and the next it’s a back-and-forth team affair closer to a MOBA, topped off with a hero-shooter veneer. During my 20 hours with Crucible thus far I grew increasingly exhausted with its manic hat-juggling, culminating in lifeless wildlife hunts, lonely team fights, and excruciating slow matches. Too often, this gauntlet is a messy jumble of parts that don’t fit together.   I catapulted into Heart of Hives first, eager to see what was awaiting my team and I as our drop pods flew through space and crashed on the planet's surface. The bay doors opened to a lush, neon hue-infused wilderness that stretched as far as the eye could see. Of the 10 playable hunter characters, Tosca, a humanoid rodent whose dry-wit is as corrosive as the acid rounds in her shotgun, was my pick for this excursion. With our boots on the ground, it was time to hunt down beasties and gain some levels.   The fauna of Crucible will gleefully swallow on your lead-aspirin, existing only to increase experience bars without actually improving the experience. In that way, stompers are more akin to minions from League Of Legends rather than the majestic wildlife from an alien planet that they're meant to be. Which would be fine, except they're haphazardly sprinkled all over the map rather than strategically placed in lanes. I loathe tediously scouring the hills just to shoot stompers like fish in a barrel, but a team can't totally ignore the PvE portion of Crucible due to the importance of increasing attack power and improving skills through leveling up for when PvP kicks off. Thankfully, experience points are shared between allies so, more often than not, I’d focus on whatever objective is at hand and leave the PvE to whichever teammate doesn't mind the busywork of euthanizing brainless cattle. Someone needs to lock their sights on the opposing team, after all.   Two enemy hunters crested the hill opposite of my position. Earl, an alien trucker packing his trusty minigun, and Drakahl, an ax-wielding brute who looks like he just walked off some mid-2000s graphics card packaging, were about to tee-off on the hive. I used the ping system to call for reinforcements, but all I heard back was silence. Crucible has no in-game voice or text chat, which makes communing with your comrades an unnecessarily grueling affair. It’s nowhere nearly as versatile or in-depth as the pinging in Apex Legends, as every ping command is tied to a command wheel in Crucible. So, I lept into action all on my own, peppering the assailants with acid rounds that deal damage over time. Drakahl wildly swung after me, but I kept him at a distance with Tosca's teleport and sticky grenades that slow targets. Earl was my primary concern, and I was barely able to stay ahead of his torrent of bullets. It’s unusual these days to be able to hold my own, not having to rely on a healer to tend to my wounds, but for the first few matches, I didn't mind the lack of the holy trinity of tanks, healers, and DPS roles.  As Tosca, the best I could do to help my allies was pop her smokescreen ability when their health was low, paving the way for their escape. But as more hunters began pouring into that chaotic hive fray, helping others was proving next to impossible. So, I stuck it out until my health was low, dashed away, healed with a medkit, and then jumped back in. It worked like a charm, and once the dust had settled after we’d beaten the other team I delivered the final blow to the hive and its exposed heart was mine for the taking. It sounds reasonably dramatic, but it’s very one-note: I could retell that exact story two more times with only minor alterations and you'd know the tale of how I won most matches since the first, too. Get in, get out, endure, and to hell with everyone else. The total absence of synergy leads to the most repetitive and banal team fights I've ever experienced in a hero shooter. iframe allowautoplay="""" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/battle-royale-1/21144/gallery/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery21144"" scrolling=""no"">Crucible takes a pretty laid back approach to microtransactions: there are no pay-to-win elements and you can totally ignore the in-game purchases. All the stuff for sale are items like character skins, voice lines, art decals, and drop pod skins. You purchase them with an in-game currency called credits, which are sold on the store for real money at various amounts. The credit bundles include: 500 for $4.99, 1100 for $9.99, 2300 for $19.99, 4700 for $39.99, and 10000 for $79.99. There’s also the battle pass, which can be bought for 950 credits. It’s loaded with cosmetics that can be unlocked as you complete daily and weekly challenges.  I'm not angry with Crucible, just weary and disappointed. Its ambitious marriage of PvE and PvP has resulted in a whole that's less than the sum of its parts, especially thanks to the awful match pacing and agonizing respawn system that smashed my patience against a concrete wall. With continued support, it might evolve into something decent, but the underlying issues will take a massive overhaul to remedy. Instead of putting its various moving parts through a vigorous trial that leads to the creation of something new and exciting, Crucible gathers the ashes and tosses them to the wind. "
368,Minecraft Dungeons ,7.0, When I first saw Minecraft Dungeons gameplay, I was like ""Is that Diablo, but with Minecraft?"" Now that I’ve played it, I’m like, yeah: Minecraft Dungeons is basically Diablo with a Minecraft skin. Sure, it doesn't mine the same mechanical depths as Diablo, and plays it safe with the formula instead of blazing its own path with bold Minecraft-inspired ideas, but it has all the fun combat, and loot it needs, and it’s accessible to just about anyone. I don't understand how Minecraft's intentionally low-res art style can look so high quality, but Minecraft Dungeons is the most beautiful Minecraft world I think I've ever seen. The Diablo series’ hellish inspirations and iconography are swapped out for Mojang’s blocky creepers and zombies, and it’s set in familiar locations like swamps, mountains, and villages made with vivid and gorgeous color. Even in the dark recesses of caverns and dungeons, everything looks great. I was particularly struck by some of the more subtle lighting effects: heat emanating from lava warps and bends the light behind it, for example, and in one level a lightning storm rages outside as you storm a castle and flashes through stained-glass windows to throw colored light on the floors and walls below. It's just lovely.  dir=""ltr"" One of my favorite levels is an autumn-themed village that’s been pillaged by the forces of the Arch Illager. Its orange and yellow foliage sways gently in the breeze, and jack o'lanterns and harvested wheat bundles lay by the wayside in the ruins of the town. The rustling leaves and whispering winds of the ambient sounds took some primordial part of my brain to the same place it goes at the start of the actual fall season. I feel like I could just sit in the middle of the level and soak it up and still enjoy it. As far as graphical performance goes, I'm playing Minecraft Dungeons on a GeForce GTX 1080-powered gaming PC, and all the graphical settings automatically maxed out to their highest by default when I first started it up. I also set the frame rate to 120 (my monitor has a 144Hz refresh rate), which also caused no problems or hesitation, and I could probably go higher. It's a pretty low-impact game, and even when the screen fills with mobs, projectiles, and magic, I didn't notice any performance issues. There's a definite advantage to a world constructed from the intentional low-fidelity building blocks of the Minecraft universe, especially with none of that pesky building or destroying to complicate things. The story is simple and exists only to tie together the dungeon-crawling levels. The main villain, the Arch Illager, stole an Orb of Power from the other Illagers and uses it for generic evil. You spend next six to eight hours chasing him down and defeating his minions until finally you face him in his castle. That's pretty much it – don’t expect the kind of swing-for-the-fences attempt at storytelling that Telltale went for with its Minecraft: Story Mode spin-off adventure. When I first started a new game, I was thrilled to see a massive selection of what I initially thought were player classes, but it turned out you just choose from a list of pre-made skins. There's nothing different about them from a gameplay perspective, which is a bummer, especially since that’s all there is as far as character customization. Some of them do look pretty cool, though – I went with the guy with the mohawk, because he’s clearly a badass. This isn’t a Diablo game, but fundamentally the gameplay is just as sweet by any other name. You play through a level fighting enemies, searching for treasures of various levels of rarity, battling a boss, and then collecting a chest upon victory. One distinctive tweak is that, rather than a traditional skill tree, leveling up gains you an enchantment point you can use to add different powers to your items. For example, my current suit of armor has an enchantment where melee attacks cause magical thorn damage to any enemy in close range. There's a decent amount of enchantments available on a per-item basis, and some items have two enchantment slots. My most recent bow, for example, throws out a fan of five arrows with each shot; this pairs well with the second enchantment where a certain percent of arrows pass through one enemy and into another, damaging them both. It’s not a ton of depth but it’s something to experiment with and can create formidable weapons. You get two weapons: a close-range melee weapon and a long-range weapon. For a ranged-based character build, I prefer the Hunter's Armor, since it gives bonuses to your arrow capabilities, but there are other armors to suit the needs of a tank playstyle, a fast ""assassin"" or a soul-collector heavy on soul-infused artifact usage. You can slot three artifacts to your character with different offensive or defensive effects, which is just enough to expand your abilities in battle without overcomplicating things. There are also wolves, llamas, and other creatures you can call upon with artifacts, and they can make a big difference when you're being rushed by dozens of lower-level enemies like zombies and need backup. Combat feels just right in a Fisher-Price: My First Dungeon Crawler sort of way: it's not too complex but still gives you the abilities to confront enemies at range or face to face. Speaking of ease, when I first started playing Minecraft Dungeons I thought the normal difficulty skewed a bit on the easy side. I was able to thoughtlessly hack and slash my way through the first few levels... but as I leveled up, so too did the difficulty. The latter half of the campaign is much more of a challenge, and required me to approach battles thoughtfully and carefully manage my potions and artifact usage. By the end, the difficulty felt just right for a first playthrough. In fact, for the final boss, I'd go so far as to say it was a little harder than I anticipated.    Beating Minecraft Dungeons unlocks a higher tier of difficulty for the character you beat the game with, and there are more granular grades of difficulty depending on your power for each mission. For example, in the default difficulty set at the outset, you can move up or down a few notches in the individual levels, but beating the game unlocks a higher tier of difficulty with gradated difficulties per mission. That means you can turn the difficulty down if you just want to grind through some enemies for a quick experience build-up, or you can crank it up to earn more experience and better loot by killing tougher enemies, but the very real possibility you'll get smacked down and sent back to your base camp. You only have three chances per level: get defeated three times, and you're out of luck. It can be frustrating to lose to a final boss and have to crawl through the entire level again, only to face the boss and lose again. As infuriating as it can be, there's no penalty to your equipment or stats for losing, so even when you lose you've still made progress. Probably the single most important mechanic in a dungeon-crawler is the loot, and Minecraft Dungeons has plenty of it. Levels are designed to encourage exploration, and if you venture off the beaten path you're often rewarded with money, chests, or even maps unlocking secret levels. Some chests and areas are pretty cleverly hidden, but I found exploration a little inconsistent. Decades of video game loot tropes led me to believe I'd find a chest at the end of a long, dead-ended area on the map, but often they yielded nothing at all. On the flip side, occasionally I'd stumble into an otherwise-nondescript corner and find a chest containing rare loot. The loot system doesn't try anything new, and it doesn't have to. You can trade in your cash at your home camp to either a blacksmith (for gear) or a travelling merchant (for artifacts), and there's still a thrill when you pull a Unique-level item. Items are completely randomized, and if you don't get the loot you want you can salvage it for gems. One thing I liked about the salvage system is if you salvage an enchanted item you’ll get those enchantment points back without penalty. What surprised me about the loot system was that it lacks a crafting system, which I don’t usually demand except that this is a spin-off of a game built entirely around that concept and even still has the word “craft” in the name. There's a crafting table in the house in your base camp, and when I first saw it I started clicking it wildly, expecting a crafting dialogue to pop up. There's also no mining or greater-than-typical breaking of things in Minecraft Dungeons, so its source material references are largely skin-deep. That's not to say setting a dungeon crawler in the world of Minecraft is a fail; far from it. It's charming as hell. But it definitely minimizes the ""Minecraft"" and maximizes the ""Dungeons."" Minecraft Dungeons is a beautiful and fun dungeon crawler with a simple but tried-and-true set of systems in place. It plays it extremely safe, though, without bringing anything mining or crafting spins to the genre to accompany Minecraft’s signature look and feel. Still, it's just so damn charming, and so fun, it's hard to fault it for going the safe route. With tons of loot, secret areas to uncover, and progressively more aggressive difficulty levels to unlock, Minecraft Dungeons has a fair amount of replayability beyond its relatively short six to eight-hour story mode. But who plays Minecraft for the story, anyway? "
369,Maneater ,7.0, Through a few millennia of hard work and dedication Sharks have earned a name for themselves as nature’s perfect killing machines, and Maneater’s titular sea monster certainly lives up to that reputation. Roaming the Gulf of Mexico as a pissed-off bull shark with an insatiable appetite for human flesh and mutagens like a one-shark Sharknado is certainly a campy thrill. Its limitation, though, is that it’s just as single-minded as its predator protagonist: the vast, vast majority of what you’ll do in Maneater are “go here, kill X of this animal or people” objectives by way of combat that’s as deep as a puddle, broken up by some amusing exploration and gathering of collectibles. I’m not saying it should’ve made us jump through hoops like a circus seal or anything, but there simply isn’t enough gameplay variety to justify the massive amount of chomping you have to do to reach megashark status.   The narrator (Chris Parnell of Rick &amp; Morty and Archer fame) who follows you around with mostly made-up shark facts, however, nails it. In his role as the show’s unseen narrator, Parnell comments on whatever you’re doing and whichever fish you’re encountering. As you move from area to area he satirically lays into beachfront resort development just as hard as he ridicules the kind of messed-up person who’d hunt sharks. “Sharks are responsible for just three percent of shark hunter deaths. Alcohol and poor firearm discipline account for the rest.” The themes at play here are a little conflicting. On the one hand we’re given good reason to love to hate the shark hunters who we mercilessly and repetitively chow down on, while on the other we’re constantly given the objective of brutally massacring innocent beachgoers by the dozen in the name of “vengeance”, thus justifying a real need for shark hunters. Except sharks don’t actually kill people very often, so there’s no reason for shark hunters and they really do suck. And yes, I am thinking too much about the messages behind a goofy game where you play as a monster shark.   These gulf waters are teeming with wildlife, most of which is beautifully rendered and animated. Aside from the very occasional glitch these other animals are almost soothing to watch as they lazily swim around, and seeing the shape of a big predator emerge from the murk can be chilling. Larger creatures even show damage as you gnaw on them in a fight, and I have to say that a huge alligator with all four limbs bitten off is somehow significantly scarier than a regular huge alligator. It’s like a massive, toothy murder-eel.  Coming across each new animal as you move across the map’s zones is great, especially since it deliberately gives little to no regard to what animals would actually be at home in the Gulf of Mexico. However, one extremely odd omission stuck out to me: dolphins are one of the few animals with a reputation for ganging up on and beating back sharks, and they somehow didn’t make the cut in Maneater. I can understand why there are no giant squid or octopus in play, as that might be technically (tentacally?) challenging, but the absence of dolphins serves no porpoise. As neat as the animals are, their ecosystem doesn’t seem as lifelike as those in games like Far Cry or Red Dead Redemption because they – and humans – are crowded together in these waters without ever interacting with or even seeming to be aware of each other. You’ll never witness an alligator chomping on a turtle or a pod of orcas attacking seals, and the legions of shark hunters will never fire a shot at any other sharks. Aggressive sharks and whales might team up against you without noticing how unlikely their alliance is. And you can conspicuously swim right up next to a seal without it realizing that their toothy death is imminent.   Fighting underwater is pretty simple: you bite the fish before the fish bites you. This involves dodging attacks using the left, right, up, or down lunge moves (which one doesn’t seem to matter that much) then making use of the essential auto-target button to refocus the camera on the enemy who just darted past you and immediately biting them or whacking them with your tail to stun them so you can bite them more. There’s a nice sharky touch in that biting a target smaller than you (or, at least below your level) has a chance to catch them in your jaws, at which point you can make a side-to-side movement with the mouse or thumbsticks to thrash them back and forth for extra damage. Once you get the hang of the timing, though, it’s usually not very challenging unless you’re up against multiple big animals in a confined space, especially since your bull shark can outrun pretty much anything in the water and can regain health by snacking on nearby small prey. In other words, if you bite off more than you can chew you can bail and then return to the fight, over and over again if necessary, to whittle down bigger fish. I died a handful of times learning my limits but after that it was rare that I went belly-up. I wouldn’t call combat bad, since it does have its moments, but it definitely suffers from a lack of variety and balance over a 15-hour playthrough. Even after you develop into a massive, mutated megashark your options for dealing with the leviathans of the deep are very similar to those you had when you were just a pup tangling with crocs in the shallows.   What changes things up, at least a little bit, is when you come up to the surface to eat some man. You’re frequently given objectives that involve consuming five to 12 people, and once you exhaust the supply of hapless swimmers, pedal-boaters, and inflatable raft occupants your only option is to hold your breath and launch yourself onto land to chase them down. It’s admittedly hilarious to flop around like… well, like a giant angry fish out of water as you move from one beachgoer to the next to devour them. Since they don’t actually run from you (let’s assume they’re paralyzed with fear rather than having terrible AI) it’s as if every power pellet that Pac-Man swallowed screamed in terror before being shredded into a shower of blood and gore. One of the biggest payoffs is when you get the Amphibious upgrade that lets you spend a lot more time out of the water chomping on human snacks and hunting down collectibles. But of course, once you’ve done that a few dozen times with little variation to make each one memorable, it does become a chore – aside from that one time you get to eat a whole rave. That kind of behavior will – after you chow down on four or five people – bring the shark hunters out after you. Fighting boats full of drunken idiots by leaping out of the water and grabbing them one by one is funny at first but gets a little tedious quickly, even when you earn and start using variations like tossing a victim into the air and whacking them back at their friends with your tail instead of simply gulping them down. Even once I’d gained access to higher-level attacks like ramming and spins and the boats got a bit bigger, I’d have killed for a friggin’ laser beam attached to my forehead. (If that’s an unlockable, I never found it.)   These fights went on long enough that I became numb to them, but there’s a reason to do it: every time you sink enough boats to increase your infamy level another notch, a named shark hunter comes after you, and killing them gives you access to a new upgrade. Hunters get a short Borderlands-style introduction cinematic that’s almost enough to establish their personalities (maybe if they had actual voices that would’ve done it?) but almost none of them have any distinctive weaponry or boats or anything to make their fights stand out. As a result, half of the time I didn’t even notice I’d killed one instead of another nameless grunt until the reward screen popped up. They could’ve used some bigger boats. One interesting thing about the shark hunters is that, unlike GTA’s star system, Maneater’s infamy level is persistent – while the narrator will mock them for their short attention spans and obvious desire to rush to get a cheap beer after work when they give up looking for you after you dive into a tunnel or simply outrun them, they won’t forget how many of their comrades you’ve eaten and will pick up with the same level of force the next time you make trouble. That’s a more believable and higher-stakes system than the conventional one, and at some point I’d like to see it put to use with a variety of responding enemy teams that makes it feel more meaningful. Growth also seems a bit stunted. It felt like I spent at least as much time in the first two levels of my shark’s life (pup and teen) as I did in the latter three (adult, elder, and mega), which was a drag because of how limited you are in those early stages in the abilities you have access to – I was several hours in before I ate my first human. And while certain hunting mission targets adjust to your level, most animals don’t, which means that until you unlock one specific upgrade (which I got almost dead last) you’ll be constantly harassed by suicidal low-level predators like barracudas or muskies.  It’s absolutely fun to play as mutant Jaws on steroids! Maneater chews the metaphorical scenery as often as it has you devouring humans and the diverse aquatic inhabitants of the Gulf of Mexico, and that’s some good dumb entertainment – for a while. But if you’re wondering whether its shallow combat and simplistic upgrades can sustain that excitement for the roughly 15 hours it takes to become a hulking megashark and reach the end of its uninspired satirical revenge story… it cannot.

370,Saints Row 3 Remastered ,7.0," Saints Row The Third? More like this is the third time I’ve reviewed Saints Row 3, and the second in as many years after last Fall’s technically shaky Nintendo Switch port. I bring that up because it puts me in a pretty good position to confidently say that Saints Row The Third remains not only my favorite Saints game, but also still a decidedly fun one nearly a decade after it first came out. I just thought that if Volition was going to go to all the trouble of remastering this hilarious GTA satire for 4K systems, it would’ve done a little more to live up to the gracefully aging gameplay.  Here’s why you should play this game, if you haven’t yet. Saints Row 3, while comically over-the-top, was nevertheless the last Saints game to have one foot still planted in reality before number 4 went full Matrix and Mass Effect on us. That relatability laid the foundation for some of its most memorable moments in 2011, and those remain fantastic in 2020. There was jumping out of a helicopter and parachuting down to reclaim your gang’s old rooftop penthouse to the tune of Kanye West’s “Power.” And no matter how many times I play it, I’ll still have a big smile on my face while cruising around singing along to Sublime’s classic ‘90’s tune “What I Got.” Its progression is still smart, too; completing missions, activities, and daring driving earns you respect and money, which can be cashed in for upgrades like dual-wielded pistols, NPC gang members you can call in as backup during battles, and increasingly stupid weapons and vehicles. Even Saints 3’s story – often a weak point in open-world jack-of-all-trades games like this – is worth seeing through. There are two equally funny endings that I guarantee you won’t see coming.  Saints Row 3 also layered a lot of fun extracurricular activities on top of the comic-book-meets-gang-warfare story. Mayhem, in which you’re given a set amount of time and unlimited ammunition for certain weapons like grenades or a rocket launcher to cause as much property damage and destruction as possible, is still gleefully fun. And I’m not sure any open-world game’s side quest or secondary activity has given me more joy than the self-destructive Insurance Fraud mode, which combines intentionally over-the-top video game physics with the sensibility of a Looney Tunes cartoon while challenging you to throw your limp body in front of moving vehicles. The goal: to cause as much pain to yourself as humanly possible in a few minutes. It’s as enjoyable now as it was in 2011.   If you’re going to deliver a remaster of a game that’s only nine years old, it’s got to look better than this – especially if it’s at the end of a console generation and not up to what the Xbox One X and PS4 Pro are capable of. We’re staring down the barrel of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, and their games will make this mediocre update age incredibly quickly. Still, the game that lurks underneath has fundamentally held up very well, and will still be a good time for new players even if it won’t live up to the rose-colored glasses view of the returning crew. "
371,Phantasy Star Online 2 ,7.0, Eight years is a long time to wait for a game to finally get ported from Japan to America. We’ve seen games get remastered for a whole new generation of console hardware in less time. But Sega’s Phantasy Star Online 2 is now officially out in North America on Xbox One as a free-to-play MMORPG. While its unique brand of anime-style flair and pulse-pounding gameplay are far from what you’d expect in a typical online game, PSO2’s amazing combat system, rewarding progression, and passionate community prove it was mostly worth the wait. In PSO2, you take on the role of a new ARKS (Artificial Relict to Keep Species) Operative. ARKS is an elite task force focused on exploring new planets and eliminating a dark and corruptive force known as the Falspawn. That’s honestly about all that you need to know or remember about this vague, jargon-packed, and emotionless story. Prior franchise knowledge is absolutely not required to understand it, but experience with the original PSO does help. (PSO2 is entirely unrelated to the single-player Sega Genesis JRPGs.)  Despite the top-notch English voice cast, PSO2 just doesn’t have an interesting story. Most of it is doled out by stiff characters that lack lip sync and feel like a waste of time. Both entering and leaving these story conversations requires sitting through lengthy loading screens. And to be clear, it really doesn’t matter; this is absolutely not the kind of game you play for the story, so the developers have clearly just focused their attention elsewhere. Rather than have you explore a sprawling open world of interconnected zones, PSO2 uses a lobby and instance system to congregate players and allow everyone to chat and team up. Once you’ve accepted a mission you’ll only see people in your party and a handful of others that may be doing the same mission. It’s a very objective-focused format that keeps things moving quickly at all times, but it loses a lot of the discovery and sense of scale that usually goes hand-in-hand with MMOs. Supposedly, ARKS Operatives explore entire planets to eradicate the Falspawn, but you only see a handful of procedurally generated arenas each mission.  The end result is a system that was probably much more feasible to run on an Xbox 360 eight years ago, but playing it today it feels like the shadow of what a modern MMO like this could accomplish. Quests come in a handful of flavors, such as Expeditions that usually set you off in a semi-open map to hunt down specific creatures, collect materials, or just beat the end boss. Then there are specific Client Orders to fulfill on quests, which are like side contracts that can reward huge amounts of XP when you take on several at a time, as well as the story conversation missions themselves. But the best type of quests in PSO2 are without a doubt the Urgent Quests. PSO2 is all about the gameplay. There are tons of classes to pick from, such as the katana and bow-wielding Braver; the gravity-defying, boot-wearing, ass-kicking Bouncer; the big sword-wielding Hunter; the assault rifle-shooting Ranger, and many others. Even the magic classes have unique twists, such as the Summoner that hovers above the ground and commands pets with a magical baton. Combat feels like a mixture of Devil May Cry and Monster Hunter, or perhaps the Tales JRPG series, depending on the class you choose. My primary class is a Braver who uses either a katana for up-close and flashy combos or a powerful bow to rain down damage from afar. The skill tree you access back at the main ship lobby is full of passive ability bonuses and minor skills like dodging and parrying, but your actual combat abilities are found as random loot drops on missions in the form of discs. You can find new skills or more powerful versions of existing skills, as well as badge tokens to exchange for even more powerful items at specific vendors. Relying on the random loot gods to bless you with new abilities is a bit lame, but you can at least sell the ones you don’t need or use them to upgrade existing skills. Overall it’s an addictive system that helps maintain excitement even when you’re much higher level. You eventually get to pick a subclass, which is literally just any of the other classes you want. You’ll gain all of the passives from the skill tree, but can’t use any of their actual skills so you should pick something that complements your main class well. That being said, you can switch to and play any main class on any character just by talking to the skill trainer in the main lobby and switching over. Trying out other classes this way is useful, but I found myself preferring to make new characters to specialize in other classes rather than switching back and forth so I have a fresh stock of quests and Client Orders to take on as well as a separate visual identity and separate personal bank storage. Every class and race is oozing with charm and genuine personality, such as the CAST, which are humanoid robots that look like miniature Gundam units and really highlight the unique tone and visual identity of the PSO universe. The stellar character-creation system is really powerful too and lets you get into the details of each race as much as you’d like. You can adjust points all across the face in supreme detail and actual clothing/outfit fashion quickly becomes a big focus if you care about that sort of stuff. Because PSO2 has had the better part of a decade to grow and iterate itself over the years, the version that North America has gotten falls somewhere between the launch version from 2012 and the current one that exists in Japan right now. A lot of the updates and systems are all present, but not all of the Episodes and content are here yet. That’s actually a good thing, because without gradually introducing all of that over a period of years, PSO2 would, at first, feel incredibly overwhelming for a new player. A lot of that content is playable solo. Many missions allow you to call on NPC allies for aid, which is a good way to practice content like difficult bosses or learning mechanics of enemies in a new region, and to take your time exploring if you’d like. But just like any online-only game, PSO2 is heavily reliant on the activity level and sincerity of its community. If lobbies aren’t active Urgent Quests won’t be playable and if people aren’t approachable and welcoming, it’ll put off new players, which are crucial for MMOs to remain lively. I get the feeling that most players on the North American version are new and never tried out the Japanese server, which fosters an endearing sense of shared discovery. Many players openly use voice chat on missions, as well as text chat even on Xbox, and once it hits PC the open communication should expand dramatically. Every time you log in, Phantasy Star Online 2 tries to shove its litany of convoluted microtransactions down your throat. That sucks, but at least you can easily ignore it all without any pay-to-win scenarios. Between the cosmetic reward items, convenience items, Salon passes, Casino passes, FUN tickets, Scratch tickets, etc etc, it’s nearly impossible to keep everything in order. All that being said though, prices are fair and nothing feels necessary to progress or enjoy yourself. It’s all cosmetics or convenience items that don’t affect gameplay.   Phantasy Star Online 2 is the kind of game you likely already know if you’re interested in before you even play it. Between the ludicrous variety in classes, sheer number of things to do and see, and the slick, refined combat, there is a lot of meat left on these eight-year-old bones. It certainly shows its age in some convoluted ways and lacks an engaging story that can hold your interest, but overall it more than makes up for those shortcomings with some of the most exciting combat that stands out when compared to any action RPG released in recent years. "
372,TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 2 ,7.0, The Isle of Man TT is perhaps the most outrageously dangerous motorsport event in the world. Held on nearly 38 miles of perilously-skinny public road draped over the Isle of Man, this enduring motorcycle time-trial barely goes a year without killing a competitor – claiming over 150 souls since its inception in 1907. Not to be flippant about the loss of life but, above anything else, KT Racing’s TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 2 aptly illustrates why this event is just so potentially deadly. Diabolically tricky and boasting a wicked sense of speed, this impressive albeit slightly uneven sequel feels fast and dangerous in a way racing games rarely muster.  The star of the show remains the complete 37.73 mile Snaefell Mountain Course itself, with its tree-lined corridors, ancient city streets, and beachside blasts. Navigating the narrow roads of the course at truly sphincter-shrivelling speeds is an immense and unforgiving challenge, and the amount of crashes I’ve had while on maximum attack has made it abundantly clear why the real TT is infamous for its sadly-extensive list of casualties. In fact, there are times when Ride on the Edge 2 seems to share more in common with something like WipeOut than a contemporary motorsports sim, such is the startling velocity, amplified by the cramped roads. The top-notch sound is an integral part of the sensation of speed, particularly the way wind noise thuds through the speakers as your bike whips past trackside objects. I’ve never been to the Isle of Man but, based on footage, KT Racing’s version of the course is an admirably authentic facsimile of the real thing. I haven’t spotted any especially major visual differences between the version of the course here and the version that debuted in the original 2018 game but, even if there were any, they’d be fairly hard to absorb at speeds regularly tickling 200 miles per hour. There’s some pop-in now and then, but not enough of it to really detract from the experience. Like the first game there’s a smattering of other, fictional tracks available too – scattered across the UK and Ireland. They’re adequate but a bit plain compared to the far more densely-detailed Snaefell course. A modest free roam mode is also included, though it’s basically the fictional courses stitched together. The open roads are peppered with typical open-world racing challenges and are adequate for a quick blat, but Ride on the Edge 2’s handling model is much better suited to full throttle racing as opposed to general exploration. The handling is definitely an improvement over the original, which felt a little more slippery overall. The heavier bikes in particular now cling to the road far more realistically and, while still quite nimble, their bulk is communicated well via their far longer braking distances. Smaller bikes have obviously benefited from the handling tweaks too but I don’t find them as fun to ride as they’re considerably twitchier. There are several layers of assists to lean on should the punishing pro handling prove an insurmountable challenge but know that, even on the simplest settings, Ride on the Edge 2 requires rapid reflexes and an extremely deft touch. A dose of gravel rash is the only reward for cack-handed cornering, and a lapse in concentration at 200 miles per hour will send you spearing into a stone wall like a sidewinder missile. The chase view leaves something to be desired, unfortunately, sometimes making it appear like the bike is swinging beneath the rider’s head like a pendulum. The bigger problem is that the low-speed handling is still a bit shonky, making acute hairpins and extremely narrow low-speed sections of track unnecessarily troublesome (Snaefell’s Governor’s Bridge hairpin and the subsequent skinny section, right at the end of a lap, is a particularly notorious offender). Tiny bumps also have a regular tendency to high side riders in the blink of an eye. Such accidents are probably partly realistic at these immense speeds, but the kind of track knowledge required to remember all the individual pieces of otherwise undetectable tarmac that will probably buck riders from their bikes in this game is out of my reach. As you’d expect, Ride on the Edge 2 features a dynamic racing line – which does place braking warnings on some dangerous jumps – but it’s a bit frustrating to be thrown off when the racing line is otherwise giving you the all-clear. Career mode has been fleshed out since the original but it’s mostly vanilla. There does seem to be a bit more structure to the path to the TT, which has several ways in which you can earn a place. The learning curve is steep, however, and conquering the AI can be a real arm wrestle – particularly when there are commonly one or two frontrunners seemingly capable of supernatural speed at times. Upgrades need to be applied to your bikes, and you’ll definitely need to secure them to be competitive. There’s also a perk system that can give you a slight edge, which functions like the mod cards in Forza Motorsport 7. These perks feel a bit weird in Ride on the Edge 2, however, as arbitrary buffs to your ballast or brakes and such seem pretty at odds with the game’s pursuit of realism elsewhere. On the one hand it’s kind of handy being able to play a perk that slows the AI down a fraction for an event but, on the other, it also feels a bit like cheating. A blisteringly quick and dangerous-feeling racing game, TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 2 is a plain package and doesn’t quite nail the balance between its serious tone and arcade-style flourishes, but it packs some top-notch two-wheeled racing. If you have the reflexes, that is. "
373,Super Mega Baseball 3 ,8.0, It’s funny to think about now, but there was a time when fans had a wide variety of baseball games to choose from. If you didn’t want a complex simulation of the real thing like MLB The Show, you could find baseball games featuring robots, little kids, or even living bobbleheads. Most of those have gone the way of the dodo now, but Super Mega Baseball 3 throws it back, not only by offering a less serious option but by recapturing some old favorite retro-style pick-up-and-play gameplay and features.    Everything I liked about Super Mega Baseball 2’s gameplay returns in Super Mega Baseball 3, including the ultra-customizable difficulty system and performance-based player confidence. The ability to use power swings and pitches is back with some nice tweaks to increase the risks and rewards of proper timing. During games, the option exists to expertly time a pitch or swing, potentially adding the little extra oomph needed for a home run or strikeout. However, overthrow a power pitch and expect that ball to not go where you want it to. With a power swing, your odds of hitting a home run go up… but your ability to simply make contact goes down. In the past, using the power options during crucial situations created some memorable moments; the increased risk/rewards only serves to sweetly ramp up the tension. I also like that AI batters seem less robotic and more likely to swing at pitches outside of the zone. I was able to generate more strikeouts than in the past by throwing junk in and off the plate. Super Mega Baseball 3 also takes its best swing at filling in some key baseball elements that were missing in SMB2, and the result is a more realistic baseball experience. In particular, the battle between baserunners and catchers has been intensified. In the past, when you wanted to steal a base you’d give the command and watched as the runner waited until the pitch was thrown. Guessing when to steal – optimally during anticipated off-speed pitches – was the only true decision for the offensive player. On the other side, there was little an opposing pitcher could do other than hope the catcher had time to make a throw. Whether the runner was safe or out was largely dependent on luck.   To combat this new level of runner control, pitchers can now perform pickoff moves with a simple press on the d-pad – pickoffs aren’t quite as nuanced as stealing. In fact, they feel more like the luck-based decisions of the past. If you try to pick off the runner and he actually is stealing… good job, you got him. But, if the runner isn’t going, he will automatically dive safely back to the bag. It’s disappointing to not be able to catch bad baserunners who are simply slow to react.  Finally, added to this mix are catchers’ fielding abilities. Bad defensive catchers will see passed balls and dropped third strikes get by them, which love for the way it puts focus on an often-underappreciated aspect of the real sport. Collectively, the interplay between baserunners, pitchers, and catchers really elevates the excitement between pitches and inches Super Mega Baseball 3 toward a more complete and authentic baseball simulation. If stellar gameplay is the first thing I think of when recalling the Super Mega Baseball series, weird-looking players might be the second. Super Mega Baseball 3 brings back the exaggerated cartoony player models, to mixed results. While I appreciate the diversity and range of players, too many look unnaturally Frankensteined together from random parts. Outside my issues with some of the player models, Super Mega Baseball 3 is a great looking game. Players are full of personality thanks to creative and humorous animations. The 12 whimsical stadiums showcase beautiful new lighting options, including twilight, mist, and summer haze. All of this seems to come at a slight cost of longer-than-expected loading times. Also of note is the very accessible customization tools, including what might be the best logo designer in any sports game. It is so easy to create fun and imaginative logos that look real enough to grace the caps of a minor league team.   These traits offer a new level of strategy when setting lineups or handling opposing teams. For instance, I chose to start a bench player whose trait gave him an edge against lefty pitching when facing a southpaw. Pitching against a batter who crushes inside pitching made me nibble on the outside corner, producing an untimely walk. These traits also help to differentiate players outside the traditional stat bars (Contact, Power, Speed, etc), breathing life into a roster of fictional players. Super Mega Baseball 3 not only adds these new traits but makes them easy to see in action. When a trait is triggered, a little audio cue alerts you that someone’s trait is active. Holding the right trigger, whether batting or pitching, brings up a list of active traits and their implications. It's very handy that these traits not only enhance the gameplay but are so easy to recognize and use to your advantage. Perhaps the biggest addition is the new multi-year Franchise Mode, which is very welcome after Super Mega Baseball 2 limited us to single seasons. While it won’t compete with the depth found in games like MLB The Show, I like that this streamlined take puts emphasis on finding and developing unique players.    These training options are woven into a fairly light economic model that also includes player salaries – but, disappointingly, no trading. Instead, there is one giant free agent pool that you can use to replace players one for one, paying or gaining the difference in salary. It’s a relatively simple system that sees players move through this free agent pool until they eventually retire. While trading would have been nice, not relying on a heavy economics system puts the focus on the players, not managing mundane details like contracts, roster size, or ticket prices. Franchise rounds out a healthy set of modes, including exhibition games, single seasons, elimination brackets, and a ranked online “Pennant Chase.” Like the previous two games in the series, the sound design remains unimpressive. While crowd noise enhances the gameday atmosphere, the background and walkup music is pretty vanilla. I do like the addition of an announcer; hearing the goofy names like “Junior Young Sr.,” “Lacky Luster,” or “Nacho Crisp” makes me smile.  From our May, 2018 Super Mega Baseball 2 review, by Caley Roark:
""Super Mega Baseball 2 is a grounded baseball simulation wrapped in an arcade-style look and feel. An accurate physics engine generates realistic hits, and it keeps stats and models fatigue and morale in interesting ways. This realism is betrayed by a few control issues that affect the timing when batting and an AI that doesn’t always behave as you’d expect. However, the unique Ego system allows you to tweak the difficulty of batting and fielding individually until you find the perfect challenge. And while it lacks the MLB license, you could use the accessible customization tools to recreate the entire MLB if you wanted to.""   The third version of the Super Mega Baseball franchise doesn’t reinvent the gameplay, which remains as grounded and easy to play as ever. However, it does add a wealth of features that make upgrading worth the price. On the field, improvements to baserunning and an emphasis on catchers’ fielding make each pitch slightly more meaningful. The new Franchise mode works well, too, due in no small part to the integration of creative and easy-to-understand player traits. Developing a living roster offers interesting decisions without having to fret about financial minutia. Best of all, Super Mega Baseball 3 surrounds all of this with the most appealing graphical style, easy to use customization, fully adjustable difficulty, and quirky humor the series has become known for. "
374,Taste of Power ,4.0,"Taste of Power, by the tiny Ukrainian developer OneOcean LLC, is set in an alternate history where originally disparate European kingdoms are forced to set aside their differences to combat the Timurid invasion from the East. In response to these threats, the Ming dynasty expands China’s borders to include Mongolia and Japan, and then they all fight it out. All three superpowers are playable, and each of their armies consist mostly of an amalgam of troops stemming from different times and places. While each unit is given a generic name like “frontier” or “templar”, the in-game encyclopedia explicitly states to which historical combatant they refer. There’s janissaries, cossacks, hussars, war elephants, ashigaru and conquistadores fighting themselves, and each other. It’s as if all of the Age of Empires, Civilization and Total War games came together to host a battle royale. Although at times Taste of Power definitely feels derivative of those games, alternate history is as good a reason as any to combine and indulge in one of their main appeals (however problematic): armored elephants killing dudes.  Like in those games, Taste of Power determines strengths and weaknesses along unit, weapon and armor type. Yet, despite some decent unit models, on the battle map they start to blend into each other. It’s emblematic of other problems: the game handles sluggishly, pathing is clunky, maps are linear and monotonous, the monochromatic interface fails to clearly and quickly provide information on the game’s different aspects of strategy and play, and you’ll quickly tire of the same two or three sounds of soldiers dying repeated over and over. It all serves to undermine the fantastical idea of these wildly diverse soldiers going at each other. The campaign does little to compensate for the deep-rooted blandness of the game. The campaign starts out with a slideshow narrated by a cross between Arnold Schwarzenegger and Dracula who explains the backstory at breakneck speed. There’s little in the way of memorable characterization or a solid narrative arc. At least the game’s voices sound convincing, because the game’s written English is not as good. It can be kind of cute when the in-game encyclopedia states that a particular unit is “ultimatum in countering with the heavy arrows of an opponent”, and hard to fault a small, Ukrainian developer, but less so when trying to decipher the tutorial, quests or other narrative materials the game provides. As it stands, there’s little reason to recommend a game that plays like an RTS that would likely feel slightly mediocre even a decade ago. Taste of Power is at best charmingly ambitious; at worst a dull, indecipherable mess. "
375,Someday You'll Return ,5.0, How far would you go to get your lost daughter back? In Someday You’ll Return, you’ll undergo a desperate search of the Czech Republic’s Moravian forest – alone, on foot, and struggling to maintain a hold of your own sanity. Yet what will really test your resolve will be the stop-start stealth sections, half-baked game mechanics, and uneven puzzle design you’re forced to suffer along the way. This supernatural nature walk could have been a compelling cross between Firewatch and Silent Hill, but Someday You’ll Return lacks the sharp writing and engaging performances of the former, and can’t pull off the scares of the latter. It certainly gets off to a decent start, though, and I enjoyed hiking around Someday You’ll Return’s woodland setting for the first few hours. The absence of objective markers on the HUD means that navigating between landmarks and campsites is entirely based around studying maps and observing the colour-coded trail markers in order to get from A to B, which felt true to my real life experiences of orienteering through nature.  Playing as increasingly distraught father Daniel, you’re on your own for large stretches of time in Someday You’ll Return, and much of the context for the events that unfold is provided through Daniel’s interactions with other characters on his phone or his constant monologuing. This is a bit of a shame, since the actor who plays Daniel has a more erratic method of delivery than a paperboy on a broken bike.  Unfortunately the bulk of Someday You’ll Return’s puzzles are not nearly as cerebral, and too often rely on point-and-click adventure-style pixel hunting or other genre cliches like lazily turning pipe valves to progress through. Considering its 15-hour length, Someday You’ll Return would likely have benefitted from having the bulk of its more basic brain teasers trimmed.   It’s not just Stela who goes missing, but also a number of Someday You’ll Return’s game mechanics. A number of elements are introduced, used once or twice, and then largely forgotten. You can brew your own potions by scouring the landscape for various kinds of flowers and herbs, preparing them using a cutting board and mortar and pestle, and then following specific recipe steps. However, despite the fact that there’s always an abundance of plants to pick all across the map, only one or two out of a half-dozen of these potions are ever really necessary, and even then it’s only when their use is explicitly spelled out for you. For example,  you might need to brew the ‘Calm Mind’ potion to quell Daniel’s vertigo in order for him to cross a rope bridge between you and your destination, because that’s literally the only way for you to progress. Daniel can also craft or repair items with his tool kit but, again, this is an ability that’s only ever called on in very specific and obvious circumstances – like when you’re presented with a ladder with missing rungs in the vicinity of a few pieces of rung-sized wood – which robs the construction gameplay of any sense of agency or invention. Someday You’ll Return’s central mystery is an intriguing one so it’s a shame that the plodding stealth sections, superficial crafting elements, and incessant backtracking muddy its allure. Someday You’ll Return is just barely worth the effort the first time, let alone a game you might actually consider coming back to. "
376,Streets of Rage 4 ,7.0, Still raging 26 years later, Streets of Rage 4 is a faithful revival of the classic arcade beat-’em-ups. Move from left to right, punch enemies, destroy objects for points, health, and weapon pickups, punch a few more enemies, and repeat. It’s simple and unadventurous, and while it expands modestly on combat with a few new skills to master, Streets of Rage 4 definitely prioritises nostalgia over any kind of big modern reinvention. The plot is wafer-thin and predictably corny, but it's beautifully presented in a comic book panel style. Mr and Ms Y, the twin offspring of series’ villain Mr X, are the big bads this time and their evil scheme is to control the city by “corrupting everything good” while looking like a couple of sub-par Scott Pilgrim villains. It’s all very silly, but in a knowing, not-taking itself-too-seriously kinda way, and it just about pulls it off.  It’s 10 years since the events of Streets of Rage 3 and series regulars, Axel Stone and Blaze Fielding, return to fight crime again despite likely being “too old for this shit.” To balance out the familiar with something different is the addition of two brand-new characters, Cherry Hunter (the daughter of series stalwart, Adam Hunter) and a cybernetic armed, absolute unit called Floyd Iraia. Just like in the old games, each character has a special move that does a lot more damage at the cost of taking a chunk out of your own health bar. However, an added risk-reward twist for Streets of Rage 4 is that any lost health can potentially be earnt back if you string a combo of standard attacks together on top of it. Any break in this combo results in the health being lost permanently. On my first playthrough, which took between two and three hours, I found myself avoiding special moves due to their risky nature. However, as I got the hang of combos I started using them semi-regularly in situations where I felt confident I could earn that precious health back. It’s a simple but interesting minigame, and perhaps the most important addition into progressing the Streets of Rage formula as a whole. A stronger weapon in your arsenal are Star Moves. Every character’s is slightly different – Axel’s, for instance, is a flaming rising uppercut, while Cherry’s is a Pete Townshend-inspired guitar powerslide – but triggering them will do a huge amount of damage to any Y Syndicate members unlucky enough to be in your path. At the start of every level you’re given one charge, but more can be collected during your travels and they’re almost always best reserved for bosses where you’ll need it the most. Using them while fighting the regular goons often feels unnecessary as most situations are manageable, but they’re still a fun spectacle with Floyd’s screen dominating uni beam being a visual treat. Another enjoyable addition to combat is the inclusion of the weapon catch maneuver. Throw any weapon at an enemy and, if it makes contact, it’ll bounce back, giving you a split-second to catch it and keep whacking away with it. Like Gears of War’s active reload timed-button-press mechanic, there's a rhythm required to master it, but once you’ve do it’s supremely rewarding. However, for every moment of feeling like a deadly ninja, there are moments that are simply unfair due to factors completely out of your control. There’s one section where getting hit with a grenade bounces you into the path of another explosion, with no way to dodge or escape. I lost half my health as a result and this inability to prevent it from happening was very frustrating. Of the four starting characters, the returning duo of Axel and Blaze immediately felt familiar and fit right in place in a ’90s side-scrolling beat-’em up, but they do feel a little generic at this point. They’re both well-rounded fighters who don’t necessarily excel in any ability, but work best as an introductory character for new players and a recognisable sight for veterans. By contrast, Floyd and Cherry couldn’t be further apart, and their movesets are by far the most exciting and fun to play. Cherry Hunter – despite carrying a guitar on her back – can move at a significant speed, which is (literally) a nice change of pace to the other characters, and that made her my preferred choice in my first playthrough. Her ability to sprint and weave through attacks feels more in line with what I expected a modern Streets of Rage would play like, which is also why I was initially disappointed with how sluggish the other characters felt in comparison. Floyd, for instance, is by far the slowest character, but I soon appreciated that what he lacks in speed is compensated for with strength. His ability to toss enemies around like rag dolls eventually won me over and had me experimenting with different playstyles. Within the constraints of the restricted nature of side-scrolling beat ’em-ups, Streets of Rage 4 at least makes an attempt to spice up the level design. Levels like Skytrain and Airplane add little bits of variety (like high-speed train signs flying at you during combat, for example) to keep the environments fresh. Weapons are no longer restricted to hand-to-hand combat either: we get giant wrecking balls, chandeliers, and plenty of destructible scenery playing its part in the violence. There’s even a level of tactics to using some of these, especially the wrecking balls. Timing your activation just right can result in dealing an extremely satisfying level of damage. There’s also a 2D sequence that conjures up memories of the hammer hallway scene from 2003’s South Korean classic film, Oldboy, where mastery of the weapon catch can make you feel unstoppable. Every change of pace really adds to the enjoyment of Street of Rage 4, so much so it’s disappointing there isn’t even more variety throughout to ensure combat is fresh from beginning to end of its short run. As it is, they’re all-too-brief moments of joy; returning to the more traditional levels is sometimes a drag. The music sets the tone and definitely feels on-brand with the iconic beats of the series. Although I’d have to say that in the era of game soundtracks like Hotline Miami and the recent Final Fantasy 7 Remake, they don’t quite hit the same sort of ‘I can’t get this track out of my brain’ status, or even its predecessors. All 12 levels predictably end in a boss fight and, for the most part, there’s a good balance of variety and difficulty throughout. Most are smartly designed with often-challenging attack patterns you’ll need to learn, but disappointingly there are repeated enemies in later levels with arbitrary difficulty spikes like, “Here’s two of them now!” In general though, the enemies are a good mix of old and new with neither feeling out of place, despite the 26-year age gap. I played through the first time alone, but that’s only half the fun. Less, even. The two-player online co-op really shines though with the intensity and chaos increased. It also made me fully appreciate the potential character combos and the satisfaction of perfectly executing a tandem move such as Floyd throwing an enemy into Cherry’s rushing flying knee. If you’re looking for longevity, two-player co-op is where it’s at. (Streets of Rage 4 also has local four-player co-op but, due to the current isolation circumstances, I was unable to try it out.) Beyond the campaign and its five difficulty levels (Mania is exactly what it sounds like!) there's a tough boss rush mode, Arcade (which is basically the story campaign but with a consistent life count), and a PVP battle mode to mess around with. But that’s it. And frankly, the story mode is better than any of these options, so if you’re playing alone there’s little replayability on offer. One thing Streets of Rage 4 does offer, however, is the wealth of nostalgic choices, such as the retro Streets of Rage 1 and 2 soundtracks and old CRT filters. It takes a little grinding to unlock, but there’s also a lifetime point system that gives access to faithfully recreated playable characters (and a modern version of Adam who unlocks during the story) from previous entries in the series. They aren’t just skins either – these characters have their own move sets, animations, and sound effects. Despite their sprites contrasting against the lush, cartoon-like world of Streets of Rage 4, these retro characters fit nicely into the combat loop and help reinforce how the latest instalment reignites that passion for the series through nostalgia. In fact, they’re so accurately recreated that, annoyingly, the characters from Streets of Rage 1 don’t even have special moves and must solely rely on their basic, “Call the cops for an airstrike” star moves. As a result they feel at odds with the new risk-reward system and it pretty much renders them unusable on the harder difficulties. In a way, this feels like a metaphor for the entire game: instead of taking bolder steps to modernise the formula, Streets of Rage 4 sticks rigidly to the past, for little more than nostalgia’s sake. Streets of Rage 4 delivers the greatest hits of the classic series and is at its best when played with at least one friend. If the primary focus was delivering a traditional Streets of Rage experience with a modern coat of paint, it absolutely succeeds. But while it layers on a few new and interesting mechanics, it’s still a very conservative update to the quarter-century-old format that feels like a slave to the past. "
377,Predator: Hunting Grounds ,5.0, The driving, iconic score that welcomes you to Predator: Hunting Grounds is one that instantly sparks nostalgia into anyone familiar with the cult 1987 movie. Unfortunately, very little else of what made the Arnold Schwarzenegger vs alien monster bullet-fest so much fun has made it into Illfonic’s latest ‘80s adaptation. There are brief bursts of frantic action lurking in the undergrowth which, when combined with tense firefights, create blockbuster moments synonymous with the source material. These moments are all too infrequent however, as Hunting Grounds often underwhelms more than it excites.   It seems like the latter should be the far more appealing option - even if the relatively long matchmaking times that come with it are not - but it’s actually as a fireteam member that I found the majority of my enjoyment in Hunting Grounds. There’s a variety of missions that you’ll be randomly assigned when landing in one of the three maps currently available. Each is essentially the same package wrapped in different paper, however, and almost entirely consist of going to a marked area on a map, holding down the square button, and dealing with a few AI-controlled guerilla fighters before moving onto the next.   These fighters aren’t the sharpest blades of grass in the jungle and will consistently funnel down the same few corridors waiting to be greeted by gunfire. They’re also surprisingly few in number and often not enough to keep all four members of your squad occupied. Disabling alarm systems can prevent enemy reinforcements but I was often tempted to let them go off so that I’d have more to do. The shooting itself feels adequate - not operating on the same plane as an Apex Legends or Call of Duty - but serviceable and at no point gave me a reason to want to stop playing. There’s a small selection of weapons to choose from, each more than effective against the AI – especially the default shotgun which counts as a secondary weapon and appears able to one-shot every grunt at a frankly absurd range. As a result of those factors these firefights offer little to no challenge and quickly become repetitive as you gain knowledge of the enemy spawn positions. It’s a real rinse-and-repeat situation, but actually more “muddy-up and repeat” in this case as you can resourcefully use the ground below you to hide your heat signature from the perpetual Predator threat. It’s a smart mechanic which actively affects the gameplay as well as being a fun nod to the film – and also where things actually get interesting. When the PvE becomes PvPvE is where a lot of the enjoyment can be found in Hunting Grounds. Moving through an enemy camp and seeing a branch out of the corner of my eye shake 30 feet above me put me instantly on edge. Seeing a pair of laser sights emerge from the canopy means trouble’s about to go down. When all of the elements of the hunt come together, high-action moments are created and the appealing core idea of Hunting Grounds shines through. Especially in the final phase, after all mission objectives have been completed and you inevitably need to ‘get to the chopper.’ The stakes are heightened as you have to defend your location from both militia and the Predator, who has to abandon subtlety and go all-out at this stage to prevent you from escaping. This often leads to those desired blockbuster fight scenes where your feet are getting hacked and slashed at by a desperate Predator as you attach to the helicopter’s dangling ropes.   For all of this to come together just right largely relies on the ability level of the player controlling Predator, and that’s exacerbated by the disappointingly unbalanced nature of Hunting Grounds – and not in the way you’d expect. Too often, the hunted become the hunters and what should be a tense, fearful encounter for the fireteam descends into a game of cat and mouse where the mouse can just turn around and unload a full clip of ammunition into their pursuer. The Predator can easily be defeated by the fireteam as long as they stick together, because the stealthy alien has very little answer to four guns being pointed at him. His health depletes quickly, and even if he does manage to escape after a close call then all the fireteam needs to do is follow the fluorescent green blood and finish him off before the tediously long healing process is complete. After all, if it bleeds...  Every round is a fairly straightforward process and it’s a shame that there isn’t more to it. I would have loved to have seen a more powerful Predator have to deal with some of the makeshift traps that Arnie’s Dutch uses at the end of the movie implemented into the gameplay. A more tactically thought-out plan of attack sounds so much more interesting than successfully going toe-to-toe with a creature that you have no business matching up against. Defeating the Predator should be the pinnacle of the experience when it comes to Hunting Grounds, but it happens far too often and offers little satisfaction. Even in Illfonic’s previous asymmetric multiplayer outing, Friday the 13th, required a ridiculously long list of win conditions and on the very rare occasion that they were completed, taking down Jason felt like a real achievement. It’s a shame that the fragile Predator offers very little threat when compared to Crystal Lake’s resident boogeyman.   Once the Predator is downed three different scenarios can play out, each underwhelming to varying degrees. First, if you get enough damage in quickly then you can finish the monster off for good and call in to HQ for the body to be collected. Once this happens you’ll have to keep the body in pristine condition while defending it from a slightly increased but still impotent number of AI forces. I have no idea why these guerilla fighters want to damage the dead Predator’s body, but they do. Once you’ve done this for long enough a cutscene will play where two of your team will recreate the most meme-able of bicep filled handshakes, which is a fun touch, but does wear thin on repeat viewings. The match then ends. It’s all very abrupt and your original mission objectives are left incomplete as the drug recipes or ancient artifacts that you were meant to collect are left untouched. It’s like going to the store with a long list of groceries, seeing a deal on ice cream, and just buying that before returning home without the essentials. It all doesn’t make much sense. If you don’t finish off the Predator thoroughly, though, he’ll have just enough time to set off his iconic self-destruct mini nuke. This is the much more interesting option that provides a few seconds of tense decision-making. You can either run and try to escape the blast radius, meaning you’ll either end the match alive or dead as again it abruptly ends once the explosion occurs. Or, if you’re feeling brave, you can try to defuse the bomb by completing a series of four puzzles against the clock. The Witness this is not, but the minigame does provide a brief period of fear and excitement that I wish there was so much more of in Hunting Grounds. The only downside to this option is that if you’re successful you’ll revert back to the monotony of defending the Predator’s body against waves of bullet-sponge AI. Meanwhile, playing as the Predator should feel like a power trip, but Hunting Grounds falls short in this regard. Some elements of everyone’s favourite Yautja’s skillset do feel great to wield and leaping purposefully through treetops, or ‘Predkour’ if you will, feels fluid. Using the net gun to trap unsuspecting enemies can be very effective, too. For the first few hours of playing your arsenal will be limited to pretty much the basics, but more exciting options begin to open up the further you progress, such as the Smart Disc and Hand-Held Plasma Caster. Those toys cater to different styles of play and let you decide what kind of Predator you want to be. It’s just a shame that you often aren’t powerful enough and are quickly put onto the back foot when engaging with the fireteam. When at close quarters it takes several imprecise melee attacks with your sharpened claws in order to down an enemy, by which time you’ll be lucky to not have a good chunk of your health bar taken away. From this point on, the tables are often turned and the Predator becomes the prey after your first engagement. Even when using your cloaking device it’s fairly easy to get spotted in the trees when retreating and before you’ve had time to claim your kill the fireteam have already revived their squadmate. It’s a fairly unsatisfying kind of encounter that needs balancing out in the near future, whether that’s by increasing the Predator’s damage output or his resistance to gunfire.   The look of the Predator and in particular the sound design is spot-on, though, and when combined with the movie’s pulsating score evokes a big hit of nostalgia. It’s disappointing that the same care hasn’t gone into the fireteam, who are just a selection of generic male and female character models that can be minorly customized. There are a couple of little nods to the original movie in the unlockable cosmetics, such as minigun madman Blaine’s cowboy hat, but it would have been nice to see more for fans of the series. On the whole, Hunting Grounds is without any game-breaking issues but could definitely do with some stabilising. There are quite a few technical annoyances such as texture popping, a few UI bugs, and then we get to the chopper choppy frames. It never gets in the way too badly, but can be especially noticeable when watching another player’s view once you’ve been killed by the Predator and decide to stick around.  Predator: Hunting Grounds doesn’t quite let you live out that power fantasy of being an extraterrestrial master hunter, nor does it provide top-tier co-op FPS gunplay. Brief moments playing on either side of the battlefield create genuinely exciting action scenes, but they’re all too infrequent and end far too abruptly when you find them because the Predator is too often outgunned and has few means of dividing and conquering his prey. There’s a consistently enjoyable experience buried somewhere in the janky jungle of Predator: Hunting Grounds, but it’s just not that easy to find yet. "
378,Gears Tactics ,8.0, Given the life-or-death dependency on taking cover in the Gears (of War) games, I can’t think of another long-running series better suited to sidestep from third-person shooter into XCOM-style turn-based tactics than this one. Gears Tactics is a spin-off with a more focused approach to the genre, ditching the larger strategy layer side of the XCOM formula in favor of pitched tactical battle after tactical battle. That comes at the cost of some replayability, but most of those fights are rewarding puzzles with fantastically polished graphical payoff.   Gabe leads a squad of up to four Gears into battle against a substantial lineup of recognizable Locust enemies (introduced at a steady clip throughout with a gruesome close-up and a couple of tactical tips) that range from basic grunts and exploding Tickers to buffing Kantuses and tricky Theron Guards. They all have distinctive and interesting abilities to counter, including some that automatically attack if you get too close (countering the insta-kill Lancer chainsaws) and some who explode in a cloud of debilitating poison gas on death to discourage executing them when they’re downed. The only ones that ever got on my nerves were the melee units – including those Ticker jerks – where I could never quite tell if they were in range of striking my troops or not.  The directional Overwatch ability is also extremely useful – essential, really – for stopping enemy advances during their turn can be enormously powerful if you can cleverly predict enemies’ movements. The satisfying “clink!” when an enemy steps into your killzone and sets your plan into motion is one of my favorite sound effects in Gears Tactics. The Locusts think it’s handy, too: they’ll almost compulsively use Overwatch to pin you in place rather than take a shot on their turn. Countering a web of overlapping Overwatch cones without taking a hit can be a tricky puzzle, and you have many abilities designed for doing exactly that. For instance, Disabling Shot comes standard with every solider’s sidearm, which has high accuracy and a good chance to knock a grub off his guard. Grenades are handy for this, too – and there are class-specific abilities that are even more effective. One of Gears Tactics’ best ideas, though, is effectively turning downed enemies into powerups. Executing a downed enemy will grant an action point to every other squadmate, making it a tantalizing reward for risking the safety of one Gear to allow the others one more move. There’s a pretty good chance that reducing an enemy’s health bar to zero will put them into the downed state, which is actually a good incentive to not use instant/overkill options like chainsaws, bayonets, and grenades at every opportunity.   No matter where you move or what you do, Gears Tactics really does look spectacular – nearly up to par with Gears 5 itself. Character models are fantastically detailed and the ruined, mostly urban environments of the planet Sera are elaborate. Animations are top-notch as well; coming from XCOM 2, I was impressed to never see anybody appearing to fire in the wrong direction or hover in the air for a moment before moving. Virtually everything looks and sounds like you’d expect a flashy Gears game to, including gory Lancer chainsaw kills that leave both chunks of Locust and blood splatter on the environment. Occasional cinematic camera shots zoom in on a wall with textures that don’t bear scrutiny up close, but other than that Gears Tactics is polished to a thrilling shine. What’s more, it’s well optimized: I played on a PC with a Core-i7 7700K with a RTX 2080 and it ran all but flawlessly on ultra settings at 4K resolution.  Some of that efficiency is likely because Gears Tactics isn’t as ambitious as XCOM 2 when it comes to the structure of its maps. They don’t appear to be procedurally generated, only specific pieces of rickety-looking cover are destructible, and there are no multi-floor structures where one unit could stand directly above another. And we’re only dealing with four squad members at a time rather than six – though it’s not exactly shy about throwing a dozen enemies at you at once!   Filling out the skill tree is one of the few things you do between missions, because as the name implies, Gears Tactics goes 100% all-in on tactical battles. There are virtually no management decisions to make beyond which soldier classes to recruit and shuffling gear around. There’s no R&amp;D, no resources to collect or spend on new equipment, and no grand campaign map to conquer. That’s not really a weakness – what’s not to like about one great tactical battle after another? – but now that my 35-ish-hour Experienced difficulty playthrough is over, the lack of a strategy layer definitely leaves it feeling less replayable than XCOM. Without thinking about what big choices I’d make differently in another playthrough, I’d be limited to trying different squad compositions and gear loadouts to emphasize different abilities. That has some appeal, certainly, but not nearly as much. Gears Tactics’ approach to progression means that your team never gets any new weapons, just new weapon mods that give you stat boosts and new passive abilities. A lot of those are extremely powerful and can absolutely change the way you play more than a slightly better shotgun would, and it’s great to see modifications like a fancy stock or barrel attachment have a visual effect on the gun model. Some of these are similar to XCOM 2’s, like a scope that gives you better accuracy or a magazine that improves your ammo capacity, but then they start layering on new benefits like more damage at the cost of ammo capacity or better damage resistance or reduced grenade cooldowns. On their own they’re significant, but stacking together bonuses produces some amazing results. I put a bunch of critical chance and damage boosts on Sid to turn him into a close-range killing machine, and toward the end I put together a scout who could throw an amped-up frag grenade every single turn.   There’s virtually no resource management at all on the battlefield, either. Ammo is unlimited — outside of ammo for power weapons that are dropped in the field — but costs an action point to replenish when you’ve exhausted your magazine (XCOM’s system), and grenades are also unlimited but on a cooldown timer. Even health isn’t a big concern, since there are no persistent wounds that last between missions, so you’re free to use your tank-like troops to absorb as much damage as you like as long as you don’t get them downed too many times. Permadeath is in play, but the presence of so many hero characters who must survive every mission they’re on makes it all but moot. Sure, you can lose a disposable soldier, but if Gabe or Sid or Mikayla gets their head caved in by a Locust thug that’s the ball game and you have to restart the mission (or at least your last checkpoint). If you’re playing on Iron Man mode that’d make them like kings on your chessboard who must be protected at all costs, but otherwise it’s pretty difficult to actually fail a mission and be forced to accept some casualties and move on unless you deliberately leave your heroes at home on a side mission where they aren’t required.   Gears Tactics’ three act-capping boss battles against enormous creatures are especially interesting because this is something the XCOM series has never attempted. They all basically boil down to keeping your troops out of the way of a giant monster’s clearly telegraphed attacks while you whittle away its health and bat down its minions. That said, the spectacle of battling these beasts straight out of the shooters makes fights fun to take part in even if they get mechanically simple after you figure out the patterns. Between story missions are a round or two of semi-randomized missions that you have to complete two out of three, or three out of four of before proceeding to the next piece of storytelling. This is where Gears Tactics makes its biggest unforced error: it uses these to pad itself out significantly longer than it should. Don’t get me wrong: side missions are generally good challenges and there are a respectable handful of types that range from rescuing soldiers in torture pods to holding out against waves of Locusts and gathering loot boxes ahead of an advancing bombardment. To keep things interesting they’ve all got secondary objectives that reward you with extra loot if, say, you avoid using grenades or never have a soldier go down; and on top of that, many have modifiers that might make you play differently. I had one mission where my troops couldn’t use Overwatch, one where certain enemies got a 2X damage multiplier, and one where my troops only had two action points per turn instead of three.   That also means there are a lot of these missions, making up the bulk of the 35 hours I spent playing through the campaign. It’s certainly a good opportunity to gather top-tier loot and improve your chances in the story missions, but grinding my Gears started to feel drawn out after a while. Especially considering you’re free to keep doing these missions to endlessly hunt Legendary loot after completing the story, it might’ve made more sense to wrap the plot up about 10 hours earlier. Most of my other complaints are related to the UI. It rarely gives you enough information in the mission select screen to know what you’re going up against, which means loading out my squad often felt like a shot in the dark rather than a decision I could make intelligently (and sometimes I found I had to restart with a new squad to feel like I had a fighting chance). When you’re unboxing a new weapon mod, it doesn’t tell you which weapon they’re for – and they’re all unique to a specific class – so until you learn to recognize the icon you have to go hunting for it in your inventory. And while I love that when you’re loading out a soldier it lets you browse through your team’s equipped gear and pull someone else’s goodies over to this one without first unequipping it from that person, it doesn’t tell you who has those items equipped until you click on it. Also, it doesn’t gray out the gear that’s unavailable because it's equipped on a trooper who's already been deployed on this round of sidequests.    Gears Tactics is an excellent turn-based tactics game that does a superb job of melding Gears’ famous style and action with the mechanics laid down by XCOM. It’s one intense and satisfying tactical battle after another, and it looks absolutely fantastic doing it. It does slightly wear out its welcome with too much of a good thing in its Gear-grinding side missions, and due to the lack of larger strategic decisions I don’t see it as being as replayable as its tactical role model. Even so, it’s a strong campaign that leaves a great impression with some clever, Gears-appropriate original ideas. "
379,Fallout 76: Wastelanders ,6.0, They say war never changes, but if that’s true, nobody told Fallout 76. Following a rough launch in 2018 that was plagued by bugs, server issues, and a generally lackluster game, Bethesda has, to its credit, not given up: it’s consistently delivered a slew of updates that’ve brought new content, features, and more in an effort to revive a game that stumbled and fell before it ever really got a chance to run. Wastelanders, its latest free update that’s more like a full expansion, is a dramatic overhaul of Appalachia from top to bottom it desperately needed. It finally introduces mostly interesting human NPCs, an abundance of fun new quests, and satisfying alterations to existing areas. As a result, Fallout 76 is starting to feel like a true Fallout game – even if it’s still not as consistently enjoyable as its predecessors.   In concept, Wastelanders has an interesting format for an expansion to a persistent online world. Rather than segmenting content and delineating between new and old quests, Wastelanders’ new quest is organically threaded throughout the world, fundamentally changing what Fallout 76 is. MMORPG expansions often pressure new players to finish the original story and every expansion, in order, on top of all the repeatable open-world content and end-game activities, but here many old and new quests overlap. That makes the new content feel seamlessly integrated, even if you’re dusting off a mid-level character from just after launch. Although, it can be annoying that there is no indication of whether or not a quest is new or old other than whether it includes a human NPC or not.  If you’re starting new and going directly into Wastelanders’ story, eventually you’ll also hit a point where Fallout 76 requires you to be at least level 20 before going any further. This means you’ll be forced to step off of the Wastelanders path and run into the base game’s countless optional fetch quests, left-behind letters, and holotapes recordings. Those are hard to go back to after interacting with the much more compelling human NPCs in the Wastelanders story. If I were to do it over again I’d probably hold off on starting Wastelanders until I was high enough level to complete it without having to take a break in the middle. iframe allowautoplay="""" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/xbox-one-gaming-hardware/15446/gallery/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery15446"" scrolling=""no""> Visually, Wastelanders makes some improvements to the wasteland, but overall it still basically looks like Fallout 4, which didn’t look cutting edge back in 2015. The lighting system in particular has clearly been upgraded since launch though, especially in the wilderness, bringing out more saturation and colors in trees and wildlife. Shadows feel more pronounced as well. However, this introduces some new bugs from time to time with weird shadow clipping through terrain or the draw distance causing textures to pop in and out in a noticeable way. At least it never crashed on me, which it often did back at launch. As recently as a few weeks before Wastelanders came out I recall quests that were still bugged or missing waypoints, so it feels like a big stability improvement.   Another use for NPCs is that Fallout 76 now lets you have ally NPCs... but they don’t follow you around on actual missions like Fallout fans would expect. Instead, once you complete a series of side quests for them, they just live at your camp with you and offer you recurring missions. It’s a bummer not getting to go questing with them in place of or in addition to other players, but at least their presence does help make your camp feel less lonely.  Lou leaves behind a series of amusing notes alongside some very dangerous experiments. It’s a great example of Bethesda doing what it does best: you could blow through a given quest in 15 minutes without exploring the environment, but as soon as you slow down, listen, read, and look at your surroundings, compelling new layers of storytelling are revealed. Coming face to face with Lucky Lou and then actually talking about what you saw is precisely what was missing from Fallout 76 before this update, and it’s refreshing to have that sort of two-way dialogue system back once again. It’s aggravating, though, that sharing these story quests socially is so awkward. They’re instanced so that you can make dialogue choices like in other Fallout games, but in practice, it’s a bad experience. When you enter as a team you get two options: everyone goes in solo, playing through their own versions, or you can accompany your team leader and watch them have conversations and make decisions and don’t get credit for completing the mission yourself. This might be nice for high-level players who want to help others catch up, but horrible for friends that want to play the story and progress together.    Bethesda also offers a premium subscription plan, called Fallout 1st, for $13 per month or $100 per year. The biggest benefits, on top of some exclusive cosmetics, a monthly stipend of atoms, unlimited scrap storage, and a free mobile survival camp site you can summon almost anywhere to dorp off scrap and take a rest, is the ability to play in a private instanced world with just you and up to seven friends (who don’t have to be subscribers). It is a bit odd that Bethesda thinks not having to play with many others in the world is worth paying a premium for, given that the social aspect is arguably the whole point of an MMORPG in the first place. Take from that what you will. Regardless, compared to the cost of Atoms in the shop, it’s actually not a terrible deal, given that 1,000 Atoms costs $10 and you get 1,650 Atoms monthly with your subscription. In other words, if you’re planning to spend money in Fallout 76, 1st is the way to go, but based on my experience you don’t need to in order to progress through the content smoothly.  With the Wastelanders update, Fallout 76 has taken a solid step in the right direction after its dire launch. New human NPCs bring a healthy dose of personality and interaction to the world and the new storyline is far more engaging because of them. There are still those signature Fallout bugs, NPCs don’t feel like they’re fully part of this world at times, and the inability to progress quests as a team is baffling, but now the good parts edge out the bad to create a game worth recommending to Fallout fans who are interested in multiplayer, albeit with significant caveats. While it still may not live up to the pedigree of Bethesda’s single-player RPGs, Fallout 76’s future at least has bright spots on the horizon rather than just more mushroom clouds. "
380,XCOM: Chimera Squad ,7.0, Much like it's titular team of aliens and humans, XCOM: Chimera Squad is made up of a bunch of disparate parts merged into one package – sometimes less than gracefully. This XCOM spin-off is a full-length game set five years after the events of XCOM 2, but it’s by no means an XCOM 3. Instead, it feels more like a beta of sorts for that eventual sequel, setting up how its world has changed in the aftermath of the liberation of Earth and testing the waters with some radical alterations to traditional mechanics, but not in a way that amounts to a particularly polished whole. Rather than fighting an alien invasion or leading a resistance movement, Chimera Squad is basically “XCOM: Cops,” which is still quite compelling despite the lower stakes. Advent is defeated, Earth is saved, and humans and aliens are figuring out how to live in harmony – well, most of them, at least. The light but well-written story has you controlling XCOM’s diverse Chimera Squad as you take to the streets of the massive City 31 to track down a series of shadowy syndicates looking to disturb that fragile peace.  With that thematic change also comes a boatload of mechanical ones, some more successful than others. Missions have been broken into bite-sized chunks, your soldiers’ turns are interwoven with the enemy’s using a new initiative system, and you now start battles with a sudden breach directly into the fray instead of a slow tactical advance. Some of these changes are just different from what we’ve come to expect from Firaxis’ XCOM rather than better or worse, but the focus generally seems to have shifted more toward smaller-scale tactics over long-term strategic decisions, which left Chimera Squad feeling thinner overall.  One of Chimera Squad’s largest departures from previous games is that the 11 possible members of your team are unique, predetermined characters with names, distinct personalities, and excellent voice acting. There’s the lovably naive Cherub, an unindoctrinated Advent hybrid clone equipped with a holoshield; the charmingly sarcastic Terminal, a human medic with a high regard for everyone’s safety except her own; and one of my personal favorites, Torque, a deadly viper who’s more accustomed to eating humans than begrudgingly fighting alongside them. By the end of the 20+ hour campaign you’ll have a full team of eight (with only four used during any given mission), and they are all as different on the battlefield as they are off it. Each one is essentially their own class, with unique but universally awesome abilities that can range from Terminal’s healing to the psychic manipulation of the endearingly monotone sectoid Verge to Torque using her tongue to pull an enemy across the map before wrapping around and crushing them to death. No matter who you use, nearly every character feels like they have some overpowered ability from the get-go. It breaks the usual rules and progression of XCOM, in which fresh recruits are sent into battle and only the strong (or lucky) survive long enough to learn new tricks, in favor of putting exciting and powerful tools at your fingertips immediately. And I don’t mean “overpowered” as a bad thing here – there’s still plenty of challenge, and the strength of these abilities makes every character valuable and distinct right away. I felt encouraged to mess around with different team compositions and combos even after finding my favorites – also, it just rules to have aliens in XCOM armor on your squad. My main disappointment in the story is that the character of each of your soldiers is only really given time to shine through mid-mission quips and some extremely entertaining but brief dialogue interactions while back at base. Despite leveling up with some basic ability progression, the fairly simple story of cracking skulls as an XCOM SWAT team doesn’t make room for any actual character development, leaving the members of your squad as the exact same two-dimensional (if interesting) characters you first meet the whole way through. I actually felt strangely less attached to any of these vibrant personalities than I did my randomly generated but highly customizable soldiers in previous XCOM games. Those blank slates didn’t have well-scripted backstories, but they did have loads of natural story growth – moments where their unexpected heroics on the battlefield shaped my interpretation of who they were, which I could then reflect in their loadout and outfit. With such immutable soldiers and no opportunities offered to see them grow like in Fire Emblem or other RPGs (and visual customization limited only to a single armor tint option), it’s easy to enjoy them but difficult to get attached. Another reason I got more emotionally invested in my past XCOM soldiers is due to one of Chimera Squad’s only outright negative changes: taking damage is almost meaningless now. Because everyone has a name and your squad is finite, permadeath has been entirely removed and the post-mission impact of damage as a whole has been lessened. Soldiers don’t need any time to recover between missions, so you can generally be more reckless without much consequence, significantly lowering the stakes of putting your most valuable players in harm’s way. If someone goes down or takes too much damage during a mission they can potentially get a “scar” that will weaken them until you fix it – slightly lowering things like health or mobility – but I only ever had scars occur three times in my entire 22-hour campaign, and spending time to fix them only took those soldiers out of the field for the equivalent of a mission or two at most. It’s not a good replacement for mortality, and is indicative of the general lack of depth between-mission management now has. Deciding which missions to take and which to skip will affect the Unrest level of City 31’s nine districts, which can lose you the campaign entirely if it gets out of hand. It’s an amusing meta-puzzle to manage, but the Intel Team system that accompanies it seems like of a slapped-on Band Aid to replace base customization. You can use a resource called Intel to build and upgrade Intel Teams in each district, which in turn increase the resources you receive each week… but that’s about it. The only strategy and decision making here is really “what resource do I want more of?” but since the answer is usually all of them all the time, the best response is basically “yes.” The excellent visual style and compelling story setup of the politics behind XCOM’s struggle in a post-occupation world does keep the conflict of managing City 31’s panicking population engaging throughout. It’s just that everything you’re asked to do outside of a fight is paper thin, making Chimera Squad feel like nothing more than a testbed for Firaxis to experiment with new gameplay concepts and setup its next big story, while the actual “campaign” structure around those experiments is just a rickety scaffolding to keep it together.  Thankfully, the combat itself is still built on the bones of the absolutely incredible XCOM 2 – that means even though some of Chimera Squad’s deviations from the winning formula have weakened it, its missions still play host to excellent tactical combat. Each fight is full of the important decisions of who to target first, where to move, and when to pop that powerful-but-limited ability or item that I love about the series. Its bespoke level layouts (with some procedural elements) are generally exciting and varied throughout as well, though you will start recognizing maps toward the end of the campaign. The most massive change Chimera Squad makes to its combat – and probably the entire structure in general – is the decision to split every mission into discrete encounters, similar to Ubisoft’s Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. Missions now take place over one to three encounters, each of which is rarely bigger than a single room, with every enemy (barring reinforcements) visible to you from the start without fog of war to obscure them. Once you clear out all the enemies or complete your objective, your squad reloads their weapons automatically and jumps to the next one. The implications of this are enormous and far reaching, sometimes for better and sometimes for worse. On the one hand, missions never have a dull moment: you’ll always be in the thick of firefights and I rarely spent whole turns just moving across open space. But on the other hand, I sometimes didn’t have to move at all. For characters like Verge and Terminal, who rely far less on gun accuracy, I could occasionally spend their turns using abilities without ever even needing to move before the encounter was over. That's not very tactical. The immediacy of always having action in front of you is also welcome and exciting at first, but has the nasty side effect of making every encounter feel functionally identical. Whether the objective is to save a hostage, clear out a room, defend an object, or whatever else, you’re always just in a room shooting dudes. Varied and visually exciting level layouts do successfully shake that up a bit, but there’s generally one gear no matter the task you’re given, and that gear is “go.” I missed XCOM 2’s moments of downtime and building tension after a while. Another double-edged sword of the new encounter system is mission length, which is generally shorter across the board. I like that I wasn’t faced with any hour-and-a-half marathons in Chimera Squad, but less important missions could also go by trivially fast. The three-encounter missions were always more fun because I knew I had to make tricky choices of how to ration my abilities across all three – especially the unique Team Up skill that can immediately jump one of your soldiers to the top of the turn order, but only once per mission. By contrast, single-encounter missions often had little strategy beyond just popping all my strongest stuff right away and going wild – that can be a burst of fun, but it requires no thoughtful restraint, so it’s not exactly complex. The encounter system highlights the general shift Chimera Squad has taken away from long-term planning in favor of more moment-to-moment decision making. Those decisions are still very fun to make and the quicker pace is certainly appreciated, but that narrower focus still means this is a thinner puzzle to solve than XCOM 2, and the bite-sized combat chunks blend together even as enemies change with decent regularity. Another prime example of this shift in priorities is the new Breach Mode that kicks off every encounter. This cinematic spectacle is cool to watch – even if you are sometimes nonsensically “breaching” a chain link fence or glass door that the enemy can clearly see you through – but similarly slims down strategic choice. You don’t get to control your initial positioning once you’ve breached through, just the order your soldiers enter and who you’ll fire at when they do. Each breach point has different boons or debuff modifiers associated with them that can give you temporary defense, stun enemies with breaching shots, or mark or root any of your soldiers that use it.  It’s an entertaining way to distill your approach strategy into a single quick decision, but it offers far less tactical control than planning how to advance on a position as a squad. All this streamlining and simplification likely makes Chimera Squad the most approachable XCOM yet, which certainly has value. I could easily see this being the gateway game that eases people into the deeper waters of the main series, but it undeniably leaves veteran players like me in a lurch as a result. Breach Mode also ties into another major change Chimera Squad tests out: initiative order. Instead of moving all of your troops and then letting the enemy do the same, your turns jump back and forth and only specific abilities and items let you push people around in that order, which is clearly displayed on the side of the screen. This new system feels more like a sidegrade than anything – not really better or worse, just a different approach to turn-based gameplay. I enjoyed manipulating that timeline to my advantage and it certainly changed the way I thought about how and when to take down certain targets, but I also missed being able to more easily set up combos between my characters. In the end, it’s sort of a wash. In keeping with the fact that you aren’t commanding a wartime army anymore – just insanely aggressive and alarmingly free-of-consequence law enforcement (you aren’t technically cops, but you are working with the cops) – there’s cool new encouragement not to simply murder everyone you see. Getting civilians killed as collateral damage can raise Unrest, making them interesting map hazards, and subduing enemies with non-lethal melee attacks or other special items and abilities will reward you with bonus Intel at the end of a mission. The extra melee option across all characters felt appropriate given the more intimate maps, and was generally a neat tool I felt actively encouraged to and rewarded for using.  Unfortunately, entirely removed from the copious amount of ways Chimera Squad morphs the XCOM formula, good or bad, are the copious amount of bugs that bring this game down a notch. I am naturally accustomed to a certain amount of rough edges in an XCOM game, but these issues ranged from minor annoyances to major inconveniences. They didn’t outright ruin my enjoyment, but there were just so many. Where to even begin... First, you’ve got an assortment of oddly familiar visual issues: soldiers randomly floating in the air, guns constantly pointing the wrong direction while firing during a breach, the roof occasionally appearing during indoor missions to block my view, enemies inexplicably freezing at the start of their turn, and more. Then there were issues that made it actively annoying to play: stuff like the tooltip for the flash grenade saying it doesn’t affect allies when apparently it actually does (I learned that the hard way), the UI on one of Verge’s abilities sometimes indicating it will damage himself too when it really won’t, or line-of-sight indicators not appearing properly when deciding where to move. But then there are the worse issues – the ones that had me audibly cursing at my screen. Once I moved a soldier out of a fire to punch an enemy, only to have him teleport back into the flames at the end of his turn. You can find a handful of special guns through missions or a limited Scavenger market, but equipping one would sometimes (not always, mind you) delete that soldier’s regular gun from my inventory, preventing me from ever being able to unequip it because they had nothing to switch back to. But by far the worst bug I encountered was when the body armor for one of my soldiers randomly deleted itself in a similar fashion. You can’t buy more armor or get any replacements, so he was permanently left with less health and armor for the rest of my campaign, which basically forced me to put him (and his un-unequippable special weapon) on research duty from that point on. Issues like this frustratingly hampered my strategic options and left me playing in constant fear of it happening again down the road. Weapon and armor-swapping bugs aren’t helped by the fact that the equipment UI is generally as ugly as it is difficult to use – far worse than XCOM 2’s already cumbersome interface. It looks borderline unfinished, making it difficult and confusing to swap items – especially when odd glitches occur, like my persistent medkit item inexplicably multiplying in quantity between every mission, apparently leaving me with over 200 extras by the end of the campaign. No matter how much time was paid to the story, characters, or gameplay alterations, the housing for those things clearly didn’t get the same attention. XCOM: Chimera Squad may be a full XCOM spin-off, but it feels more like testing ground for radical departures from the previous two games than a proper sequel. It plays with bold changes to the existing mechanics and story, but only props them up with a thin bit of scaffolding rather than a cohesive whole. Its unique characters are wonderful and its new ideas are certainly an interesting change of pace, even if they sacrifice some of the deeper strategic choice and dynamically generated storytelling I love the series for. Thankfully, none of those changes stop its combat from still being XCOM, and that tried-and-true formula (even with initiative-based turns) goes a long way toward keeping it fun in the face of its frustrating bugs and occasional missteps.

381,Moving Out ,8.0, Helping friends move house is widely regarded as one of the worst ways you can spend a Saturday, but somehow developer SMG Studio has taken that most dreaded of friendly favours and transformed it into fantastically frantic fun. Moving Out is a couch co-op game about cooperatively moving couches, successfully expanding Overcooked’s brand of coordinated chaos from the kitchen into every other room in the house. Often tense and frequently hysterical, Moving Out is a must-play for fans of same-screen multiplayer games. dir=""ltr""     It’s absolutely manic, but successfully executing a plan is utterly exhilarating. Corners can be cut if you’re willing to take risks by throwing and catching fragile items from one player to another, or heaving a refrigerator out of a second-storey window instead of dragging it down the stairs. Even the order in which you load the truck is an art unto itself. Use up all the flatbed floorspace with smaller items first, and you won’t know whether to laugh or cry as the double bed you hurl onto the top of the pile to finish the job tumbles right back out of the truck, further delaying your exit. Moving Out seems shambolic at its start, but demands real thought, coordination, and planning by its end.  In addition to the reward of getting gold-medal times, I also enjoyed returning to each level for the bonus objectives. Each one has three optional tasks – some of which are clear, such as completing a job without breaking any windows – while others are more cryptic, not unlike those found in Untitled Goose Game. Those require you to experiment with the various objects and contraptions found within each setting, for example the objective may be to ‘Give the bird a bath’ and to achieve it you need to find a decorative pink flamingo somewhere in the level and hurl it into the bathtub. Successfully completing these 90 objectives unlocks 10 extra mini-games in the arcade menu, which is a series of timed gauntlet runs that provide some of the most fiercely challenging cargo-shunting stretches in Moving Out.   Provided you’ve got at least one friend in tow to share the load and the laughs, Moving Out is an absolute blast. It takes a simple set of mechanics and milks madness and mirth from them in equal measures, consistently shaking up the parameters of its heavy-lifting assignments to keep you on your toes while you’re bending at the knees. Moving Out is the best way to get your mates to help you move house without having to owe them a case of beer afterwards. "
382,Trials of Mana ,8.0, In bringing this charming and beautiful 16-bit game to the modern era, Square Enix has done a fantastic job transitioning from 2D to 3D, wonderfully recreating the feel of the original in great detail. However, this faithfulness is a bit of a double-edged sword, because Trials of Mana throws just about every mid-90s JRPG trope at you, making its locations and stories feel out of date in spite of the modern graphical overhaul. Trials of Mana, known as Seiken Densetsu 3 in Japan, came out in 1995, but the original didn't see a Western release until last year's Collection of Mana. I'm of the belief that this is the most beautiful 16-bit game ever made, and the remake does a wonderful job capturing most of that beauty. Given the fact I'm an old man, set in his ways, I prefer the 2D pixel art of the original, but the remake translates its charm admirably in a way that kids today can appreciate. Trials of Mana has a gorgeous, colorful art style, with hyper-saturated colors giving everything a deep, dreamlike hue. On Switch, Trials of Mana looks lovely; on PS4 Pro, it's even better – and you’ll avoid the Switch’s frame drops if you play there. Even docked, the Switch looks like it's struggling to hit 30 frames, and in some cutscenes the framerate looks awful. It's particularly noticeable late in the story when you’re calling your dragon friend, Flammie. It's… it's not smooth. Musically, the new incarnation of Trials of Mana’s modern arrangements of the original chiptune soundtrack sound phenomenal. One feature I really like is the ability to swap between the remake and the original 16-bit soundtrack at any time. Both are just so good! In fact, at one point I swapped to the original soundtrack and completely forgot to change back. It's a testament to just how great the original soundtrack is, and how faithfully transposed the old MIDI files are for instrumentation.  These days, the term “remake” can mean anything from a borderline remaster that simply aim to recreate the original game scene-for-scene in a new engine to a complete reimagining of the old game’s themes, like an XCOM: Enemy Unknown or a Resident Evil 2. Trials of Mana’s remake is on the extremely loyal side of that spectrum, and just about everything plays as it did in the ‘90s. The ring menus of the original are here, used in much the same way, and they're a great solution to juggling spells and items mid-combat. Plus the sounds they make are like old-school ASMR. Combat, too, feels incredibly similar, and I mean that as a complement because I've always liked the Mana series' unique action RPG battles. I love the balance between the real-time combat of action games with the party management of an RPG, which mercifully pauses the action so you can cycle through the rings to find the command you want to give without undue pressure. It takes some getting used to its chaotic rhythm, that's for sure, but when Trials' combat clicked for me, all the disparate parts and pieces felt manageable and made perfect sense. My main complaint about the 2020 version is that the camera doesn't follow you in battles: you have to move it on your own. There's already enough to think about with combos and charge attacks, and I don't need another thing to keep track of – especially something so important as being able to see what’s going on. The real fun in combat comes from Trials of Mana's many boss battles. Maintaining your party through some of the tougher fights means thinking ahead, exploiting elemental weaknesses, and keeping everyone from dying through liberal use of magic and items. The AI for your party members does a great job keeping them doing what you actually want them to do, so you don't have to scream at the screen because your healer is running head-first into a melee attack while the rest of the party is on death's door. You're also free to swap between party members at any time and take advantage of one of their special abilities or magic spells when you need it to be used in a specific place. The ability to change characters mid-battle gives you even more flexibility. On normal settings difficulty felt a little on the easy side, but there's a Hard setting, too – that might be a good mode for returning veterans to start out on. (There’s an Easy mode as well, of course.)  While I’m a big advocate of maintaining fidelity to the original’s gameplay, I found myself wishing Square Enix had been willing to make a few departures when it comes to the plot. The loyalty to the original’s story and locations means there’s lots of empty, cliche NPC dialogue to sort through (""Yippee! Long live Laurent!"" and ""Welcome to our humble town, traveler!"" for example). That seems like the kind of thing a remake should leave on the cutting room floor, given the rare opportunity to improve a great game’s pacing. At the same time, there aren't any sidequests, or really any compelling reasons to talk to NPCs at all. I don’t want to be sent to clear the sewers of rats or anything but I could’ve used some local color. That's not to say Trials of Mana is lacking in content. It's not. You pick from one of six characters at the start, as well as a secondary and tertiary character for your party. It took me just around 20 hours to make it through Duran's story with Angela and Charlotte as my party, but you're free to play through as any of the six characters and experience the stories from their points of view. Each one has their own story, all of which cross paths with each of the other characters at least once in the course of a playthrough. Also, when you meet one of the characters in your party for the first time, you're also given the option to play through the opening of their stories. In the interest of expediency I opted out, but Trials of Mana did a nice job recapping everything for me without forcing me to play through two extra hours of backstory. I appreciate the choice. There are also class changes to unlock, with battle techniques and abilities varying depending one which you pick. Each class change has two options – Light and Dark – each with their own strengths and weaknesses. There's no penalty for choosing Dark over Light, they just present different options as you progress. You change your class at level 18 and again at level 38, so you can have a Light-Light, Dark-Light, or Dark-Dark character. For example, I chose the Dark class for Duran at level 18, which gave me the choice between Edelfrei or Duelist classes when the chance to change presented itself again. Edelfrei gains a 15% increase in weapon efficiency, while Duelist gets an increase in attack power after defeating enemies in battle. Abilities and charge attacks are also tied to which paths you choose, but ultimately I just chose the classes that looked the coolest. I'm definitely enjoying myself in the excellent post-game, but I won't spoil the story elements behind it. There's a new Class 4 option (Square Enix announced that a while back, so it's not a spoiler.) that you unlock, and I'm going to tell you right now: I've only unlocked one so far, and it was the toughest part of all of Trials of Mana up to this point. The post-game is more substantial than I imagined it would be, both from a content perspective and from the way it adds to the existing story. Trials of Mana is absolutely charming and does an excellent job keeping what works from the original while upgrading its aesthetics to the modern era. The combat system works well in its new 3D trappings, with a tough but satisfying learning curve. The transition to modern tech has introduced some camera problems, though, and I wish Square Enix had taken this opportunity to flesh out the world with interesting sidequests and to trim out some of the more tedious dialogue. Even so, exploring, battling, and waging war with bosses all remain really fun, and its JRPG tropes come off as charming throwbacks rather than eye-rolling cliches. "
383,Cooking Mama: Cookstar ,3.0, With the bizarre (and seemingly disproven) allegations that Cooking Mama: Cookstar is a trojan horse for cryptocurrency mining on your Switch, it doesn’t help that Cookstar feels so suspiciously under-developed that it’s easy to believe it might have an ulterior motive. Have you ever walked past a store that didn’t seem like a plausible business and wondered if it might be a front for something illegal? Cooking Mama: Cookstar feels a lot like that. Whether it’s the asinine and tiresome minigames, the cringe-worthy voice acting, or the unforgivable motion controls, Cookstar warrants an investigation into what exactly went wrong. There’s quite a bit to do in Cooking Mama: Cookstar, though very little of it is actually enjoyable. The two main modes are “Traditional Recipes” and “Vegetarian Recipes,” which are pretty standard fare for the Cooking Mama series. You play a sequence of simple and repetitive minigames that have you cook food, then plate and take a photo of your creation, which you can post on social media if you need to send your family and friends an obvious cry for help. There are over 80 recipes which account for 20+ hours of time you’ll need to spend in your virtual kitchen, though much of them require you to do the same steps over and over again, like cracking eggs and mixing ingredients. To its credit, each recipe is incredibly detailed and Cookstar does an admirable job of making me feel like I’m actually learning how to cook some of these recipes, which is by far the most rewarding part of Cookstar.  In the unenviable event that you’re playing Cooking Mama: Cookstar with a friend, the Potluck Party mode offers 10 cooperative and competitive minigames with riveting activities like seeing who can chop the most potatoes or who can clean the most dirty dishes. That’s right: Finally, Cookstar brings all of the excitement of competitive tedious chores to the Nintendo Switch, all without the actual productivity – and not a moment too soon! There are a few mildly amusing modes, like where one player controls a clove of garlic and the other tries to smash him with a mallet, and one where both players apply condiments to a burger and try to avoid one another’s trail that’s reminiscent of Tron’s Light Cycles. These modes are barebones, though, and feel so completely superficial that they become stale in seconds. While cooking recipes in single-player you’ll be playing a lot of less interesting minigames, which are largely either overly simplistic and mind-numbingly dull or incredibly frustrating due to poor motion controls and irritating design. Most amount to simple quick-time events where you press a button or wave a Joy-Con repeatedly until you’ve poured some liquid or chopped an onion. After the first few times you’ve played these, you’re probably pretty bored – but it keeps going, and going, and going anyway. But the frustrating minigames are even worse. While in docked mode, most minigames use motion controls, which is fine if you’re just cutting vegetables. But once you get into more delicate tasks like Cookstar’s rage-inducing cheese-grating minigame you’ll experience the ugly side of inaccurate motion controls. I’d move my arm to pour some ingredients into a bowl and the Joy-Con simply wouldn’t register anything. Then I’d become frustrated and panicked as the constantly ticking clock warns that I’m nearing failure, so I’d desperately swing the Joy-Con around only for Mama to tell me that I’m moving too fast and the ingredients would spill everywhere. Other minigames are just poorly designed, like the dough-kneading minigame, which has you follow prompts that pop up so slowly sometimes you fail due to arbitrary timing. Failing challenging tasks is one thing, but failing easy and tedious ones because you’re apparently jiggling your Joy-Con too fast is truly madenning. Luckily you can simply play in handheld mode or turn motion controls off, which makes things much less frustrating but also greatly increases the level of monotony as cooking becomes strictly a matter of quick-time events. Of course, success or failure hardly matters in Cookstar anyway. Simply completing recipes at any level of success grants cosmetics and unlocks the next recipe with no real incentive for doing so well. You can practice recipes in a dedicated practice mode, cook meals by following prompts in the “Cook It!” mode, or play the “Cookstar” mode where you play chef without the guidance of prompts, but each mode plays identically and doesn’t really lead to anything beyond unlocking the next recipe. There just aren’t any kind of stakes in Cookstar. As an experiment I tried my best to intentionally botch a recipe to see if I could create the grossest food ever, but literally nothing I did changed the outcome. When making a grilled cheese sandwich, I botched slicing bread, refused to grate or apply cheese, and burned the sandwich to a crisp. When the cooking was done and it was time to take photos of my food it looked the same it would have if I’d succeeded at any step in the process. If my failure or success were actually reflected in the final product that alone would have done wonders to improve my investment in doing each recipe well; seeing that nothing I did mattered anyway just made it feel all the more pointless. As you chop, grill, and steam your way through Cookstar’s various recipes, your ears will be tormented by some of the poorest voice acting in recent video game history. The self-proclaimed “mama” of Cooking Mama fame relentlessly repeats the same haunting lines without reprieve. If you’re doing something well she’ll egg you on, and if you’re doing something poorly she’ll whine and complain. If you’re going too fast she’ll tell you to slow down, and if you’re going too slowly she’ll tell you to hurry up. If you’re doing nothing at all, she’ll scream at you to say she’s getting hungry. It’s easily one of the worst parts of Cookstar and, after a long day of playing, I went to bed with her nagging voice in my head, afflicting my dreams. It goes without saying that the mute button is your friend. On top of all of that, one of Cooking Mama: Cookstar’s biggest failings is that it tries almost nothing new. Cooking Mama (2006) had the benefit of being an adorable showcase for the Nintendo DS’ touchscreen, but rather than doing something special on the Switch it simply recreates its predecessors with better graphics, more complicated recipes, and terrible motion controls instead of using the stylus. And when I say that it doesn’t try new things, I mean that quite literally. A side-by-side comparison of recipes from previous Cooking Mama games will show just how little things have changed, and that’s a major problem if you’re revisiting the series 14 years later (as I did) because it’s already stale the moment you start playing. Cooking Mama: Cookstar is bogged down by monotony, poor motion controls, nightmarish voice acting, and practically nothing new to offer. Whether it’s the lack of consequences for failure, the obnoxious voice acting, the bland single-player modes, the lackluster multiplayer minigames, or the complete lack of meaningful progression, Cooking Mama: Cookstar is a tedious game that does almost nothing well.

384,sident Evil 3 Final ,9.0, Resident Evil 3 is another killer remaster from Capcom. Raccoon City has been recreated in stunning detail, peppered with realistically abandoned spaces, charming in-game advertising, and devastating environmental storytelling, while labyrinthine level design full of challenging nasties makes exploring a delight. It’s easy to recommend purely for that centerpiece, which is good, because its 4v1 multiplayer mode, Resistance, doesn’t stand out nearly as much because of unbalanced survivor team composition and uninspired environments. That said, playing as an iconic Resident Evil Mastermind gave me a delightful rush of power every time. Here’s my verdict for the single-player campaign:   Like Resident Evil 2 before it, Resident Evil 3’s 2020 remake does an amazing job of recapturing the horror and tension of the late ‘90s original while completely modernizing its gameplay. It plays like a 2020 game because it is a 2020 game. The classic world is brought to life in glorious detail, and smart level design makes exploring it a delight and replaying it almost compulsory. If only all remakes could be this good; bring on the next one. And here’s what I said about Resistance:  Resident Evil: Resistance’s 4v1 multiplayer mode has its moments but could benefit from some character balancing and combat feedback that feels as good as it does in single-player. Playing as the villainous Mastermind is consistently far more of a blast than trying to stay alive as the unbalanced Survivors, particularly because you can play as iconic baddies from across the series but also because messing with your victims feels so devious. Overall, Resident Evil 3 is a wonderful continuation of Capcom’s latest remake efforts. Although its just-okay multiplayer mode falls short of the bar set by its magnificent single-player campaign, the latter does such a good job at balancing 2020 gameplay and a classic Resident Evil tone that I recommend it without reservations. Hopefully, we’ll see more classic games in Capcom’s library remade with such finesse and loving care – along with some new games, too. "
385,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered ,7.0,"If you put Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered in front of someone who’d never seen it and told them it was a new game that came out in 2020, they’d probably believe you, no problem. That’s how good a job the team at Beenox has done on the technical side of this project. But this single-player campaign has a problem that Raven Software’s 2016 remaster of the original Modern Warfare’s story missions didn’t have: it’s arriving into a world where Infinity Ward’s outstanding 2019 reboot of Modern Warfare already exists. It may not be fair to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered to compare it to its own reboot, but it’s also not unfair when we’re all playing this one afterwards. While a lot of Modern Warfare 2’s mission design holds up really well, it still feels old in some noticeable ways. Beenox has done an excellent job of making Infinity Ward’s blockbuster 2009 first-person shooter sequel look, well, modern. It looks excellent running in 4K on a PS4 Pro, as PlayStation is the only place to play this until April 30 as part of an exclusivity arrangement with Sony. Textures are fairly crisp and detailed, character models look really good, and the lighting is mostly nice. The strengths of the original get to really shine here: it’s always good to hear the voices of actors Lance Henriksen and Keith David, whom I’d forgotten were cast in the lead roles. Certain things still show Modern Warfare 2’s age, though, like the fire and explosion effects and the flat outdoor lighting in the early daytime missions.    Given that I haven’t played this 4-6-hour campaign since it originally came out, I’m surprised at how much of it I remembered. That speaks to how memorable a lot of these missions are: I still love the snowmobile escape early on, the frantic fight through the favelas, the battle at Burger Town where you can sadistically abuse the drone-strike missile capability you’re given, surviving the war in firebombed Washington DC, and the very memorable finale. The weapons as played through the lens of 2020 expectations are a collection of same-y machine guns intermixed with some still-as-fun-as-ever fun thermal-scope automatic weapons, sniper rifles, and riot shotguns. And breaching a door in slow motion is still one heck of a grin-inducing experience. And then there’s Modern Warfare 2’s most infamous level: the intentionally controversial No Russian, in which you’re sent undercover and asked to shoot innocent civilians in a Russian airport terminal alongside the bad guys (and yes, you can still skip it if you don’t feel comfortable playing it). Ten years on, I decided to see if I could get through it without pulling the trigger, and while you can avoid shooting a single civilian, you’ll still need to open fire on the police who arrive on the scene later in the level. So one way or the other, this mission can still make me squirm. Thank goodness for all of its memorable, Michael Bay-style blockbuster moments, because in 2020 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is competing for our attention with its own very impressive reboot. In that light, the generic shooting-gallery gameplay of Modern Warfare 2’s campaign feels dated – after so many games we’re onto the magician’s trick now. The new Modern Warfare has largely pushed the series past this for the better. So while this remaster is still a fun ride that looks impressively current, it’s lost a lot of its punch. Some of that is due to the advances of time, but it’s mostly because it’s been bested by...itself. "
386,Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord Early Access Review in Progress,8.0, Since it launched into Early Access this past Monday I’ve spent about 20 hours with Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord so far, and it definitely makes a mixed impression. On one hand, it’s a whole lot prettier than its 10-year-old predecessor, Mount &amp; Blade: Warband. The map looks gorgeous, allowing you to scroll completely seamlessly from practically right over your character’s shoulder all the way up to a high-level strategic view. The lighting, textures, and terrain are all impressive. The level of detail really makes me feel like I’m in a living world. And they’ve done away with the weird, blocky, edge-of-the-map geometry blobs that made Warband’s map look like the gods hit a certain point and just gave up.   Not everything else about Bannerlord does, though. For something that’s been in development for about eight years, there’s still a fair amount of jank on display, which is probably why it’s got that Early Access caveat. Especially early on, it’s easy to get the feeling that you’re just playing Warband with better graphics. Targeting and interacting with items and characters in towns and on battle maps is still imprecise and sometimes unresponsive. The controls can be unwieldy, especially on horseback. There are a lot of little things that really don’t feel modern, which are especially noticeable next to all of the ones that do. The worldbuilding in general is pretty great so far. Set about 200 years before Warband, we see the ancestors of some of the factions we know locked in a tense struggle centered on a collapsing, Roman-inspired empire that has broken into three parts. Each of the six playable factions has its own rich personality, backstory, and style of fighting. I wish your choice of national origin had a little bit more of an impact, though. As it stands, it’s mostly flavor that doesn’t impose restrictions that might make you significantly alter your playstyle. Anyone can recruit any kind of troops and join any faction they wish. You only get one small campaign bonus based on where you were born, like being able to build structures faster or reduced movement penalty in forest terrain.   At least once I got out and about and started meeting the various princes, lords, and knights, I developed an interest in the cast more organically. There is an intricate political web to unravel between the leaders of the various factions, with each having a different story about what happened at a pivotal battle right before the start of the campaign that set the present events in motion. As I continue to build my reputation, I find myself excited to meet new characters in person I’ve only heard about second-hand, and try to get to the bottom of their conflicting stories. I do worry that since these characters can die (if you’ve enabled the setting to allow it) and be replaced by heirs, that handcrafted chessboard of larger-than-life personalities will someday give way to something more generic. Only time will tell if the procedurally-generated characters who follow in their footsteps can fill their big shoes.   The biggest new systems seem to be the Clan and Kingdom screens. You can get married and have kids, and even play as those kids once they’re grown, much like Crusader Kings II. Your clan levels up as you gain more renown, unlocking larger army sizes and the ability to form multiple, distinct war parties that can act independently. If you join (or rule) a kingdom, you can even make changes like setting new tax laws – as long as your vassals approve, of course. I haven’t gotten far enough in to try out most of these new toys yet, but I do find them highly intriguing and am eager to work toward them.  As is typical of an early access game, I’ve heard a lot of horror stories about weird and even game-breaking bugs out in the community, but mercifully I haven’t been the victim of any serious ones so far. I’ve hit a few irritating video and audio glitches here and there, but the worst that’s happened to me so far is reloading a save and having some troops I recruited mysteriously disappear. And that’s only happened once. It’s easy to focus on all the ways Mount &amp; Blade II is still stuck in a rut starting out, but Bannerlord is an onion with lots of new layers to show once you start to really dig into it. Especially for an early access game, it’s ambitious and reasonably well-polished, even if it still has a long way to go. And with the huge graphical and general usability improvements, a latter-day rehash of Warband – one of my favorite games of the last decade – isn’t even a bad thing by itself when you get right down to it. I look forward to continuing my journey from pauper to king, and sharing my thoughts on the battles and dynastic struggles along the way.  It’s a shame that Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord lets you auto-resolve its glorious action/real-time strategy combat but forces you to endure dozens of hours of laborious and repetitive activities on its dry, flavorless overworld map. If I could skip over the bugs, shallow grinds, and frustrating non-combat activities around building up your faction and quickly return to battle it'd be easier to recommend. When it comes to simulating a medieval warfare at the ground level between hundreds of soldiers down to every swing of a sword and clash of shields, this is the only game in town. "
387,sident Evil: Resistance ,6.0,"In the absence of a Resident Evil 3 New Game Plus, Capcom has instead bundled in a 4vs1 multiplayer mode called Resident Evil Resistance to bulk up the package. However, unlike the meaty, visually stunning single-player campaign that had me eager to return for seconds, Resistance is a briefly fun distraction that hasn’t left a mark on my memory. Resistance is a Dead by Daylight-esque asymmetrical multiplayer game that sees four non-descript survivors go up against one of Resident Evil’s canonical masterminds: Annette Birkin, Daniel Fabron, Alex Wesker, and Earl Spencer. As a survivor, the goal is to methodically scour the map for keys to unlock the exits of three areas before the timer ends; the Mastermind, meanwhile, gets to cackle delightfully over-the-top dialogue and throw zombies, heavies, explosives, traps, and all sorts of other obstacles at the survivors to stop them in their tracks.    The actual minute-to-minute search for items is the sort of thing you’d do in the single-player campaign. However, here these crucial items are randomized throughout the world instead of carefully and thoughtfully placed as part of a breadcrumb trail, so it’s a ‘puzzle’ in name only. Still, a nice sense of flow can occur if you all work together to unlock the exit as fast as possible. The six survivor characters have various class-based skills that are fun to play around with: Tyronne the tank, for example, has a power kick that sends zombies flying, meanwhile, January the hacker can disable the Mastermind’s cameras, which will cripple him or her for vital seconds.    Each survivor has a Fever Skill – essentially an Ultimate Ability – that can be unleashed after a certain amount of time. But again, these feel a little unbalanced. Valerie is crucial, as her First Aid Spray skill will heal nearby team members; however, Becca’s only gives her a short period of unlimited ammo. That feels less important considering the wealth of ammo scattered throughout the maps.   In my experience, the most fun to be had in Resistance is as a Mastermind. You can bounce between security cameras scattered throughout Resistance’s scant four maps to keep an eye on the survivors, and you can use a combination of traps, creatures, and a bioweapon (unique to each Mastermind) to cause all sorts of chaos in a relatively short space of time. Do you actively get up in survivors’ faces with zombies and other nasties, or do you lay traps, lock doors, and cause havoc from afar? My favorite method is to place leg traps at just the right spot and then spawn several zombie dogs at that same location. At its best, playing as a Mastermind makes me feel like a delightfully evil poltergeist.   The four maps that serve as your playground to tool around in are… fine. Although they’re built in the same RE Engine as the extremely gorgeous-looking single-player campaign and have theoretically interesting spaces, like a casino and an abandoned park, they don’t stand out in any particular way and tend to visually bleed into one another. I hope that as more maps are added there’s more visual diversity in the mix.   Unfortunately, the points you earn are specific to one character – it’s not shared between all of them – and you’ll barely earn any RP if you choose to play in a custom match. That means that not only are you penalized for trying different things, but also you earn most of your points through the more randomized Quick Play matches. There, it’s not guaranteed you can play as the character you want, so you can’t focus on that one even if you want to. Your best option is to play as a Survivor in Team Play with your friends, or choose to play only as a Mastermind, and that feels limiting.    Resident Evil: Resistance’s 4v1 multiplayer mode has its moments but could benefit from some character balancing and combat feedback that feels as good as it does in single-player. Playing as the villainous Mastermind is consistently far more of a blast than trying to stay alive as the unbalanced Survivors, particularly because you can play as iconic baddies from across the series but also because messing with your victims feels so devious. "
388,Totally Reliable Delivery Service ,6.0, If you took Death Stranding’s delivery-based gameplay and traded its oppressive post-apocalyptic setting for a tropical toy town with overblown physics you’d have Totally Reliable Delivery Service. In a similar vein to Goat Simulator and Human: Fall Flat, this game is shambolic by design in order to derive maximum humour from the resulting unpredictability, but it takes it to such an extreme that it’s not always easy to identify where the deliberate wonkiness ends and the unintended rough edges begin. As a result, Totally Reliable Delivery Service is just as likely to trigger fits of laughter as it is to spark fits of anger. Up to four players, either locally in split-screen or online, can cooperatively tackle 100 different deliveries dotted around an island-based sandbox. I say up to four players but what I really mean is a minimum of two, because although Totally Reliable Delivery Service can technically be played solo, it is a vastly inferior experience when you don’t have additional dopey deliverymen bumbling along with you to either help or hinder your progress.  Deliveries can be tackled in any order and your success in completing them awards you a gold, silver, or bronze trophy, some cash, and a cosmetic item to customise your character with. I didn’t really find any of these rewards particularly compelling, though, especially the cash which seemingly can’t be spent anywhere, and my only real motivation for undertaking each delivery was the chaos that would typically unfold en route between each dispatch zone and reception point.   There are a number of different vehicles to help ship your consignments, from forklifts and speedboats to helicopters and hang gliders, as well as a solid variety of different delivery types. I particularly enjoyed the urgency of the bomb disposal requests – literal TNT Express jobs – where the slightest jolts had explosive repercussions. Elsewhere, the delivery that required a motorised launcher to sling large fish into the upper deck of an air traffic control tower was as hilariously absurd as it sounds. But while Totally Reliable Delivery Service’s pool noodle character limbs and exaggerated physics conspire to create no shortage of laughs, it all seems a bit too slapdash beyond the slapstick. Getting your character stuck inside objects is an annoyingly regular occurrence, and it’s particularly aggravating when it happens at critical moments – like when you’re just about to offload a delivery inches away from a drop-off point and your foot falls through the flatbed of your truck, leaving you to feebly flail back and forth like one of those inflatable men out front of a used car yard as the clock continues to tick.  Totally Reliable Delivery Service is also hampered by some pretty horrendous pop-in when playing on PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch, resulting in even more moments of disparity instead of hilarity as you pilot some precious cargo in a helicopter bound for a snowy mountain top only to plough into a towering bridge that suddenly sprouts into existence a short distance ahead. Technical issues aside, my biggest disappointment with Totally Reliable Delivery Service is that, despite the fact it’s clearly more fun with friends, its mission design hasn’t really been crafted with cooperative play in mind. There’s rarely any need to work together to achieve your goal, as invariably what happens is one person drives the delivery vehicle while the others just hang off the side and try not to fall off. I certainly feel that Totally Reliable Delivery Service would really shine if it were to emphasize a more Overcooked-like level of coordination in order to complete each job. Totally Reliable Delivery Service delivers some goofy laughs with family or friends as you fumble your way to a destination without completely destroying your cargo, but like a package that’s been bashed into your front door a few times before finally being pushed through your mail slot, it’s noticeably rough around the edges and some of its contents are broken. "
389,Panzer Dragoon: Remake ,6.0,"Any Sega Saturn heads in the house? You kind of have to be to carry a torch for Panzer Dragoon, a 25-year-old cult classic 3D shoot-em-up series where people ride dragons like fighter jets, dodging and weaving past giant creatures and shooting down airships. That context is important when looking at Panzer Dragoon: Remake, the new visually heightened version of the 1995 original with modernized control options and reimagined environments that bring the world to life in new ways. The shooting, flying, and the enemies you face remain mostly preserved, though, which means Panzer Dragoon: Remake feels like an experience rooted in 1995, including the limitations and old-school frustrations native to the time. Panzer Dragoon’s story is window dressing. You play as a man who, by chance, finds himself creating a psychic link with a blue dragon and chasing down another guy riding a black dragon. If you read a wiki or find some story related-materials from when Sega originally put out there’s a lot of lore about the world and what’s going on, but very little of it actually makes its way on screen. It’s not really needed, though, because Panzer Dragoon is a 3D on-rails shooter campaign that lasts for less than two hours. You control the dragon, dodging and weaving around the screen to avoid projectiles, while shooting enemies with your laser, which has you fire rapidly or pressing and holding shoot to lock onto multiple targets. Both weapons are important: Lock-on shots make it easy to grab and take down a few targets at once, but you can’t use it to shoot down enemy projectiles. Finding the rhythm of switching between offensive and defensive shooting creates a rapidly rising and falling tension as waves of enemies ebb and flow.   You’ll want to look around though, especially if you played the original Saturn version and want to appreciate the improvements. Panzer Dragoon: Remake completely reimagines all seven levels, building out the environments and adding lots and lots of additional detail. In the original 1995 version, the first level features scattered stone columns sticking out of otherwise undisturbed water to symbolize a flooded ruin. In Remake, the flooded ruin has been fully realized, with broken buildings jutting out of craggy rocks. Every crack and crevice of all seven levels has received similar treatment, expanding upon the environments the Saturn could produce to create a series of fully formed spaces.   That said, I don’t want to overstate things. It’s really cool how much has changed and how those changes feel organic, but the art itself isn’t especially impressive. The designs of the dragons and enemies are detailed and interesting but feel generic without enough story to anchor them.  Also, while the gameplay remains unchanged for the most part, there is at least one new mechanical feature: a modern control scheme option. The original controls are still the default in Remake, but they sync moving and shooting on the left analog stick. With these controls, it can take a long time to push the dragon to a far corner of the screen, which can make it difficult to dodge attacks. The new control option separates aiming and shooting, which increases your mobility and may feel more like a modern game, I found that it didn’t help my maneuverability as much as I’d hoped when it comes to dodging incoming fire.  Panzer Dragoon: Remake is a cool window back to a neat little corner of video game history. With modernized graphics acting as rose-tinted glasses to make it more visually pleasing than the 1995 original, this is a neat little arcade shooter that keeps things exciting for an hour or two. It’s just enough to make me wish that the developers had gone a little farther and built this remake up with more levels or, maybe, gambled on a fully modernized take on the original’s simple concept. "
390,Persona 5 Royal ,10.0,"Persona 5 Royal is a living master class in how to take an already amazing game and amp it up to the next level. It’s not just a standard “game of the year” edition with some extra content thrown in on the side. Just about everything in Atlus’ 2016 (2017 in the US) JRPG magnum opus has been honed, polished, and expanded in some meaningful and positive way. Across more than 130 hours of adventuring through urban Tokyo and the surreal realms of the human mind, the amount of love and attention to detail hiding around each old and new twist in the story left me in awe.         There are also some new encounter types, including a volatile variant of certain enemies. They’re more powerful than the normal form and launch a devastating counterattack for every hit they take that doesn’t finish them off – but they also explode and deal massive damage to all of their allies once defeated, often ending the battle in one blow. This serves to spice up areas where you might have to fight a lot of similar enemies in a row, and encourages you to change up your usual tactics. The combination of all of these new battle and progression options can make certain areas feel a lot easier than they were in the original version, at least if you’re a Persona 5 veteran. But rest assured, the new and enhanced boss fights still offer a significant challenge even on Normal difficulty. And you may remember our old friend The Reaper, the semi-secret enemy who is supposed to be Joker’s ultimate challenge? In Royal, he’s immune to the Despair debuff, so you can’t kill him the cheesy way by fighting him on specific days. This means taking him down is truly the toughest task available to undertake, and it felt absolutely amazing once I finally pulled it off.   The third semester is only one part of the expanded story, though. The main campaign has also been significantly beefed up with two new confidants joining the already rich cast: bubbly, aspiring gymnast Kasumi Yoshizawa and calming but dorky school counselor Takuto Maruki. Each has a dauntingly deep, tragic backstory filled with its own impactful twists and turns that were both painful and compelling to uncover. And one of the returning confidants from the original Persona 5 has had their role in the story significantly tweaked and expanded – but I won’t spoil who. To balance out the extra time it will take to max out your relationships with these new characters, Royal has quite a few new ways to spend your free time optimally, like a random chance to have a dream that gives stat or relationship points every night that you go to bed without doing anything else in the evening. And focusing on fresh faces is really rewarding in palaces, not just outside of them. Kasumi and Maruki can permanently increase your HP and SP, respectively. Kasumi can also give you a new way to use your grappling hook to ambush enemies from a distance and inflict them with harmful status effects, which is pretty game-changing against some tougher groups. One of my only disappointments is that Kasumi can’t join you as a permanent party member until the third semester, but you’ll see quite a lot of her and get to test out her skills a couple of times before then.   I could practically fill a TV documentary with the long list of other small and medium-sized improvements found in Persona 5 Royal, but here are a few of my favorites: The Thieves’ Den is a new hangout area that will follow you across multiple playthroughs. Here, you can decorate with statues of personas you’ve unlocked, listen to the absolutely superb new and returning music, and rewatch any cutscene. Those new tracks are just as awesome as the classics, adding variety and fitting in perfectly with the energetic acid jazz that is such a huge and memorable part of Persona 5’s identity. If you were finally getting tired of the catchy “Last Surprise” – and let’s face it, after two playthroughs of the original version it’s hard not to be a little bit over it – there’s even a great new battle theme that plays during ambush encounters. Which is to say, you’ll be hearing it during most battles if you’re playing optimally, relegating Last Surprise to being a welcome, every-once-in-a-while nostalgic treat.  Persona 5 was already a strong front-runner for being the best JRPG ever made, and Royal really gets me wondering what else could even compete. The excellent story and its lovable, multidimensional characters along with the challenging, tactical combat are all refined and back for another round with new surprises and new friends in tow. There are new areas to explore and new twists to leave your jaw on the floor. Very little has been left untouched, and just about everything that has been touched is better off for it. The Phantom Thieves have stolen my heart all over again, and I don’t really want it back. "
391,One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 ,8.0, I thought I would be bored by the time I beat up my 500,000th marine lackey, but to my surprise, One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 never let the smile fall from my face – except for when it’s trying to make me cry with its many faithfully recreated scenes of One Piece’s most emotional moments. One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 is an Omega Force musou game through and through, letting you satisfyingly steamroll hundreds of thousands of enemies single handedly as powerful hero (or villain) characters. But it comes with most of the typical baggage that goes along with that distinction: it’s not the prettiest looking game in the world, there are lots of reused assets from prior games, and outside of a few select boss fights, its hoards of baddies offer very little resistance.  That said, Pirate Warriors 4 managed to surprise me with a well thought out combat system that has a ton of variety strewn across its selection of more than 40 playable characters, excellent cooperative support, and a highly respectable retelling of One Piece’s absolutely massive story.   It’s also worth noting that if you’re coming into Pirate Warriors 4 as anything less than a gigantic One Piece fan who has watched everything up to the start of the currently airing Wano arc, you’re going to get spoiled big time. This definitely is not a replacement for actually watching the show. Pirate Warriors 4 covers six main arcs: Alabasta, Enies Lobby, the Paramount War, Dressrosa, Whole Cake Island, and a shoddily thrown together original version of the Wano arc that exists solely to give Pirate Warriors 4 an actual ending since the real Wano arc isn’t finished yet. Those who played Pirate Warriors 3 may get a little bit of deja vu, as the only completely new arcs are Whole Cake Island and Wano, but Pirate Warriors 4 goes much deeper into each of them than its predecessor, with every arc consisting of at least six missions. Each chapter has its own selection of playable characters to choose from, with some levels restricting you to just the one character that’s relevant to the story, while others allow you to choose from a wide variety of heroes that are present in the scene. I always jumped at the opportunity to try out a new character, and fortunately, those opportunities presented themselves at just about every turn. It was this variety that kept Dramatic Log fun and interesting throughout its 15 hour length, despite the repetition inherent to Pirate Warriors 4’s gameplay. Dramatic Log is the main course of Pirate Warriors 4, but there’s also the Treasure Log mode which is a series of mostly context-less levels that come with their own rewards and ready-made challenges. Just about everything in Pirate Warriors 4 can be played with two-players co-op in split-screen, but certain levels in Treasure Log can also be played with four players online, and have unique objectives as a result, which is great. Multiplayer is definitely a strong suit for Pirate Warriors 4, especially considering how easy it is to pick up, smash some buttons, and watch the fireworks fly.  If you’ve played a musou game before, you know what to expect from Pirate Warriors 4 on a base level. This is a game all about simple button presses leading to impressive actions. One that treats enemies like they’re a million styrofoam peanuts and the player like they’re a leaf blower. Pirate Warriors 4 adds a few interesting wrinkles to the fold, mainly the ability for every character to utilize air combos, which actually does a lot to further differentiate its roster. By pressing the jump button in the middle of a combo, characters take everything around them up into the air where they have an all-new series of attacks. Some characters, like Sanji, absolutely thrive in the air where they can use multiple special moves to deal big damage or utilize a buff that gives them unlimited stamina, which allows them to continuously cancel and restart combos with an air dash to stay in the air for as long as they want. Other characters, like Jimbei, are hopeless in the air and basically need to be on the ground in order to do significant damage. The gameplay is super fast. With the ability to connect a three to four-hit ground combo, then launch enemies up for another combo, then combo that into a special move, which can then be canceled into more air combos, there’s just a ton of frenetic movement that always keeps the action fluid and exciting. Despite that though, the implementation of aerial combat is not perfect. Some characters are given the ability to fly freely, but the controls are messy. There’s no way to control your height, which can make it frustratingly difficult to actually hit enemies when you’re above them, and sometimes characters can move so fast that it can be hard to actually focus on a single enemy like a commander or boss if you need to take them down first. Above all else though, Pirate Warriors 4 is a One Piece power trip, and it’s a really good one at that. Just about every character feels insanely strong in their own satisfying way. Luffy in particular feels nigh unstoppable when he transforms into either of his Gear Four forms, but especially when he’s in Bounce Man form and starts charging up a Kong Gun that ominously looms over the heads of hundreds of helpless enemies that are about to get sent flying. Omega Force has done a great job with its progression mechanics as well. Not only does each character have their own skill trees that build upon their arsenal of unique moves and stats, but there’s also a universal skill tree that provides bonuses to all characters. It’s a nice system that forces you to make some interesting decisions when it comes to stats with regards to whether you spend resources making everyone a little bit stronger, or you focus in on making a single character stronger that you might only use for one level. Between the 15-hour story mode, the many additional hours that it’ll take to complete Treasure Log, and unlockable characters that are tied to getting S ranks on missions, there’s a ton of worthwhile content in Pirate Warriors 4 that will keep me busy for quite some time. One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 is a great One Piece game, and though it wears its many flaws on its sleeveless, red button-down top and straw hat, its smart additions to combat go a long way in reducing the notorious tedium that typically plagues the musou genre. It’s still a tough sell to a non-One Piece fan, but as someone who absolutely loves One Piece and was only just sort of into Musou games, I found a ton to like in Pirate Warriors 4. "
392,"Borderlands 3: Guns, Love, and Tentacles DLC ",7.0, We are gathered here today to talk about Guns, Love, and Tentacles, the sharply written Lovecraftian DLC for Borderlands 3 which puts the wedding of Sir Hammerlock and Wainwright Jacobs in the center of its scopes. Though everything about it is exactly what you’d expect from Borderlands DLC – in a good way – it also doesn’t do much to make its few short hours really stand out. What starts out as an eccentric couple’s wedding on the creepy, remote world of Xylourgos predictably turns into a nightmarish cataclysm of eldritch horrors. So, y’know, just some normal Borderlands stuff. You’ll smack, blast, and meat-bicycle your way through some unique areas like the eerie, possessed town of Cursehaven; the dark, sickening groves of Cankerwood; and the accursed halls of a manor controlled by a cult that worships a Cthulu-inspired God called Gythian. For a series that once had a big problem with the lack of diversity in its exclusively Pandoran environments, Guns, Love, and Tentacles feels like a victory lap of breathtaking views and unique areas.  dir=""ltr""    Fortunately for those of us who’ve been waiting for more DLC since December, there’s plenty to do aside from the main story. Sidequests are mostly entertaining distractions, and there are occult creature hunts to go on for Sir Hammerlock which can be fairly challenging. For rewards, you’ll have eight new legendary weapons to chase for those who want to be best equipped to slay Gythian’s octo-pals with extreme prejudice. On the other hand, some tasks are pretty dry, like picking flowers for your new testicle-eating friend. Yup. That’s a thing. iframe allowautoplay="""" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/borderlands-3/23848/gallery/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery23848"" scrolling=""no""> On Xylourgos you’ll mainly fight against occult followers of Gythian. These weirdos interact with you and one another in all sorts of interesting ways during combat, like buffing and healing one another, resurrecting fallen allies from the dead as exploding suiciders, or even eating your guns. That’s right: they literally eat your guns, those monsters! Each encounter with these tentacle-loving psychopaths has to be considered before being tackled, because not killing necromancers before taking on everyone else could result in you getting overwhelmed by undead explodey boys. Xylourgos’ mobs are deadly, sometimes annoyingly so, but the end result is some of the most interesting combat encounters we’ve seen in Borderlands. Guns, Love, and Tentacles is a witty, solid expansion for Borderlands 3 that mostly plays it safe with a proven formula without introducing anything that makes it a must-play. Still, the environments and enemies are unique and interesting enough to provide new challenges to players. Oh, and do you like testicle jokes? It has testicle jokes. "
393,Exit the Gungeon ,7.0, 2016’s Enter The Gungeon is transcendent. It fuses buttery-smooth combat, cutesy pixel art, and hilarious callbacks into a surprisingly deep roguelike-shmup. It has style, substance, and about a thousand different guns.   Thanks to a “blessing” you receive at the beginning of a run, your gun transforms several times every minute while fighting your way out of the now collapsing Gungeon.  One second you’re wreaking havoc with a frog blowing bubbles; the next, it’s a tentacle that squeezes enemies to death. And the next, you’ve got a nail gun that exists just to make sure you know how good you had it with the frog. The more you hit enemies without getting hit, the more your combo meter increases. Supposedly, the higher this combo meter goes, the more likely you are to receive high-quality guns while you’re playing, but it never seemed to make much of a difference to me. Great guns, like the Predator appear at low levels and bad ones, like the nail gun, show up at high levels. That said, it’s a little comforting to know that even in a bad run you still have a chance at a comeback.  At the end of each of Exit the Gungeon’s five levels you’ll encounter one of 13 goofily designed bosses. The Saturday-morning-cartoon art style belies just how badly they’re likely to kick your ass the first few times you face them. But after several rounds, you’ll begin to recognize that what first seemed to be an impenetrable wall of bullets can be an easy-to-dodge attack. Beating a boss flawlessly doesn’t just feel good, it’s recognized with an additional heart, and extra Hegemony Credits. Credits are the currency you use between games, while you’re back in the safe hub known as the Breach. Here, you can switch between characters for different passive abilities and room orders, talk to NPCs, and – critically – buy new items and guns you might encounter during a run. Unlock enough of the inventory, and you’ll undoubtedly have some very powerful builds you can find – and those can be the difference between a completed run and an embarrassing clunker. That means every failure inches you just a bit closer to success. Or hey, you can always buy silly new hats instead. It took nearly 40 attempts for me to finally Exit the Gungeon, and despite some underpowered weapons and an ineffective combo system, it’s an enthralling platforming roguelite challenge. It’s not as satisfying nor deep as its predecessor, but the urge to finish a run with every character, unlock all the NPCs, and try out each and every gun gives Exit the Gungeon some legs. "
394,Control: The Foundation DLC ,8.0,"Control, which I called Great in my 2019 review ahead of its win as IGN’s Game of the Year, left me the way most memorable games should: satisfied with its self-contained story, but wanting more from its universe. Its first major DLC expansion, The Foundation, does just that yet again. It excels at being as weird and wonderful as the base game, but it’s certainly more of what I loved rather than something totally new. Not that that’s a bad thing. The Foundation’s story sticks wonderfully true to Control’s ending, which is great because it’s available instantly upon completing the campaign. Jesse Faden is now acting head of the Bureau… and life goes on. She has a job to do and more problems to tackle, but of course these problems just happen to be of the extradimensional variety. Despite quelling the Hiss’ spread at large, the very foundation of the Oldest House is at stake, and Jesse’s new adventure mostly trades in the stark workplace minimalism for a cavernous underground tunnel system that is no less ominous. The grays and... other shades of gray of the Bureau are replaced by bright-beige rock walls and mounds of red sand pulled straight out of Star Wars: The Last Jedi’s Crait. Even if there’s only so much you can do with the limited color palette, the Foundation’s aesthetic never wears out its welcome or becomes so same-y enough that it gets confusing to navigate. And developer Remedy finds plenty of reason to incorporate both the Bureau and the Astral Plane in surprising ways I won’t spoil. But their inclusion feels earned and only deepens the connection of this new location to the world I’d already grown to love. And it all looks stunning, especially running on a high-end PC that allowed the ominous, ray-traced lighting of Control’s world to truly shine. The Foundation’s more organic setting allows Remedy to play around with scope, producing some pretty impressive, imposing abysses. I looked into a handful of depths of total black or skylights of brilliant white and often wondered just how big this location might be.         A pair of new abilities reflects her new level of experience, and the order in which you get them is your choice. The real demonstrable change that choice makes is which of the objectives you tackle first, but either way you’ll be taking them all on. One power lets you destroy crystals growing in the environment blocking your path, while the other lets you grow these same crystals in other locations to create platforms or, better yet, impale the Hiss to dust. I definitely leaned toward using the latter because of its dual purposes, as the real benefit to breaking crystals comes down to picking up a few extra gun and personal mods hidden around the environment and I never felt like it was being stingy with those anyway. Taken together, though, these crystal powers offer a nice bit of variety to making your way through the large-scale environments, and Remedy even finds a nice way of tying in the impact of Jesse getting the second ability into her relationship with the Board. Nearly everything felt like it mattered in the world of Control, and that continues to be true with the DLC. Similarly, The Foundation’s best and worst bits often echo what worked and what didn’t in the original Control. A deeper understanding of the Bureau, and this new location, comes from locating all the hidden collectibles filled with eclectic, funny writing. And the optional Altered Item encounters are once again some of the most unexpected delights around, offering unique twists on boss fights and combat arenas in ways that make me wish there were another dozen to tackle. Meanwhile, occasional slowdown still occurs when the action gets too heated and enemies are filling the screen, but on a high-end PC those moments were rare. By The Foundation’s end, I didn’t come away with a seismic shift in my feelings on Control. It continues to nail what worked in the base campaign, adding more of what first captivated my attention. In trusting Remedy to take me down corridors I didn’t expect to walk, I received a few new, fun powers, some wacky side challenges, and world-building that offers satisfying answers and intriguing questions that have me eager to return yet again to its world. "
395,Half-Life: Alyx ,10.0, One of the first things that struck me when I started playing Half-Life: Alyx was the dirt under Alyx Vance’s fingernails. It’s a simple thing, but it’s not often that you see that level of fine detail in a VR game. Usually, virtual hands are either low-detail ghostly apparitions or gloved. This grit also tells us something about this character, a scrappy survivor raised in the aftermath of the Seven-Hour War in which the alien Combine conquered Earth, and it quickly establishes that she isn’t as buttoned-down as that MIT-educated nerd Dr. Gordon Freeman. Subtle as it is, it sets the stage for the best VR shooter I’ve ever played by a mile – and one of the best in any perspective.  Aside from the new perspective, Alyx feels very much like a traditional Half-Life game. It’s set up as a linear series of areas, starting with a normal City 17 neighborhood and then moving underground, through industrial areas like a distillery, high-tech Combine facilities, slimy alien nests, and more. Each chapter of the 15-hour campaign feels substantially different from the last, including one that relies heavily on an unkillable antagonist you have to work your way around, and some that are all but pitch black except for your wrist-mounted flashlight. Combat is a major part of the journey, but so is puzzle-solving. Some hacking puzzles pop up when you go to unlock various Combine technology. None of them are terribly complex – for instance, there’s a memory-matching game where you connect points on a holographic sphere and a very cool-looking one where you trace the path of electricity through a wall and rotate connectors in a power-flow puzzle – but all of them make heavy use of VR’s ability to work in three dimensions, and some of them actually get tricky when they scale up in the later levels. Disarming tripwire mines by tracing a path through rings as a burning fuse chases you – while being careful not to accidentally trip the mine with your hand – can get fairly intense. And then there's the environmental puzzles. In true Half-Life fashion, getting from point A to point B is often more complicated than it sounds. I’d sometimes wander around an area wondering if I’d hit a bug and an event that would open a path forward hadn’t triggered; I always felt like a goof a few minutes later when I figured out that the solution was a trick that’d been explicitly taught to me earlier, or was pretty clearly marked by a wire or something. It's all there, once you learn what kinds of cues to look for. All of this serves as a welcome cooldown and counterbalance to combat.   All the while your remote, lovably oblivious and blunt sidekick Russell (distinctively voiced by Rhys Darby) chatters away in your ear with some laugh-out-loud gags about vodka and sandwiches, among a great many other things. It’s a very similar brand of humor to what Valve gave us with Wheatly in Portal 2, although he’s not evil. Probably. His rapport with Alyx gives her a chance to shine as a character as well, allowing her to reveal her optimism about the future and naivete about the world before the invasion. Appropriately, Russ’ signal tends to be blocked out during the moodier, more horror-flavored moments, which lets Half-Life: Alyx create some fantastically spooky atmosphere. Detail is one of the things Valve does best. Environments look amazing. You can see the hairs on the legs of the bloodthirsty, turducken-sized head crabs as they leap at your face trying to eat your brain – although counting hairs is hardly the first of your concerns at a moment like that because animal instincts kick in and cause a jolt of panic. Healing stations squash a gross antlion grub in a vial and then inject its juices into your fingers through delicate robotic needles. Just about every poster or newspaper clipping you see up on a wall is fully written, either in English or Russian (I assume, anyway – I can’t read Russian). Smashing open a supply crate yields a shower of packing peanuts as well as items.      That said, there isn’t as much physics-based mayhem as I expected coming off of Half-Life 2. Unlike the Gravity Gun, your Gravity Gloves have no launch ability, only a pull, so you can’t bisect enemies with saw blades and the like. Grenades have to be tossed with your normal human arms. It all works fine but as someone who loves the Gravity Gun I couldn’t help but want that full power in my hands. Room has to be left for a sequel, I suppose. Instead, guns are your main instruments of defending yourself from lurching zombies, lunging headcrabs, dangling barnacle traps, armored Combine troopers, and worse. There are only three weapons (or five, counting grenades) in Half-Life: Alyx, but even the basic pistol you’re handed from the get-go has a powerful punch to it, and emptying a whole magazine into an interdimensional fascist feels awfully good. Keep in mind, though, that handling it, the shotgun, and the SMG are big adjustments if you’re not familiar with VR shooters and the more elaborate reloading procedures that are common when you’re holding a virtual gun in your hand.   Upgrades from there change things up in meaningful ways. For instance, when you first get the shotgun it’s got awesome stopping power but it’s cumbersome, and you have to go through the reloading procedure of popping it open, inserting rounds, closing it (you can do this with a flick of your wrist if you want to be cool), and chambering a round every four shots. Upgrade that with the auto-loader, however, and you can slot six shells into the side and then hit a button to watch it mechanically load for you with an intricate animation. When you can blast away multiple times, the shotgun basically becomes a “delete enemy” button for anything at close range, which is why its ammo is relatively scarce. For the pistol, just increasing your ammo capacity is a big deal since it reduces the time spent reloading, which is when you’re at your most vulnerable. But it’s the laser sight that was the biggest game-changer for me: suddenly having pinpoint accuracy from the hip feels almost like a cheat mode after having to slowly and deliberately line up your shots using the iron sights or holosight to avoid wasting ammo until you can afford the expensive upgrade. Just like in previous Half-Life games, you have to move around a whole lot in Half-Life: Alyx, and there are several options that allow for everything from playing seated to room-scale immersion (and even a one-handed mode). As an individual blessed with a strong stomach and a coffee table I can move out of the way to create a decent-sized area, I played exclusively standing and moving, with the free movement controls instead of teleportation. With these, you can use the left thumbstick to walk around like you would in any first-person game, using the right thumbstick to make quick, 45-degree turns for when I didn’t want to get tangled up in the headset cord. You do have to “jump” gaps from time to time, but pulling down on the right stick lets you point at a target and release to teleport there as though you’d actually performed a feat of athleticism. That’s also useful for if you don’t want to crouch under barriers yourself (though that’s certainly an option) and for when you might get stuck on terrain. Back when VR first became a real thing and we all started spitballing which game worlds we’d most like to be fully immersed in, Half-Life topped my list (tied with BioShock). It took a few years, but Half-Life: Alyx has more than realized that potential. With it, Valve has set a new bar for VR in interactivity, detail, and level design, showing what can happen when a world-class developer goes all-in on the new frontier of technology. In a lot of ways, it feels like a game from the future, and one that the rest of VR gaming will likely take a good long while to match, much less surpass. "
396,Call of Duty: Warzone ,7.0, The Call of Duty: Warzone beta takes a vastly different approach than most other battle royales. Death is an inconvenience rather than the end, top-tier weapons are consistently easy to come by, and skill will only get you so far when there are no more armor plates to loot. While that means it excels at being accessible and easy to pick up, it pays a high cost where depth is concerned. Solos manage to get all of the good without very much of the bad from these trade offs, but the same can’t be said when you squad up. Still, the impressive 150 player count, tried and tested arsenal from Modern Warfare, and well-crafted, massive map consistently deliver excellent firefights even if they sometimes lack the genre’s high stakes and endless variety.   Like Blackout before it, Warzone’s Verdansk battle royale map mashes up several familiar locations from Call of Duty’s past, albeit on a much larger scale. Verdansk is massive, dwarfing its predecessor and then some. And for a space this vast with a 150-player capacity, Warzone’s performance on PC impressed me as I rarely experienced frame drops or connectivity problems, which feels like a triumph in this context. I did have some trouble with mantling onto ledges in certain areas and the ping system just stops working if you try to use it at too long a range, not to mention that it isn’t nearly as intuitive or robust as the one found in Apex Legends. But these annoyances are very much the exception rather than the rule. You’ll be hard pressed to find an area devoid of well-crafted explorable structures brimming with weapons, supplies, and cash which can be redeemed at randomly placed buy stations for things like killstreaks, armor plates, or weaponry in loadout drops Like the name suggests, the loadout drop lets you equip the guns, gadgets, and perks of your custom Modern Warfare multiplayer loadouts in the middle of a Warzone match. And when I say middle, I really mean beginning. Acquiring the requisite $6,000 to purchase a drop can be done within the first minute of the round if all three players in a squad chip in. While you’ll still need to come by ammo and armor elsewhere, using a loadout drop to scratch two weapons, throwables, and perks off your shopping list in the first 60 seconds of a match is just too easy to make hunting for the randomly placed guns feel worth it. As a result, the stellar weapon variety that fuels other battle royales’ replayability, creates exciting asymmetrical firefights, and incentivizes combat isn’t really a part of Warzone’s main squad-based battle royale mode. I never jumped with joy when scoring a rare gun from a chest or slain enemy since I knew my prefered kit was only moments away, if not already in hand. I also didn’t see the appeal of straying away from the Overkill perk or my favorite weapons from Modern Warfare’s multiplayer (like the M4 and HDR sniper rifle with a thermal optic), especially since trying something new would have effectively meant spending several hours unlocking attachments I didn’t already have – and I’m evidently not the only one who feels this way since the aforementioned combination (or some similar variation) are ubiquitous in Warzone. Being an offshoot of Modern Warfare, every weapon in the arsenal feels sublime, so it's a shame that I wasn’t tempted to use more of them. I loved that Modern Warfare’s Gunfight mode exposed me to a wide variety of weapons thanks to its randomized loadouts and I had hoped Warzone would scratch that same itch. But even the high rarity weapons found in special orange chests around Verdansk and come pre-equipped with several attachments are a distant second to the guns I have literally dozens of hours of experience with. Loadout drops are a messy solution to a problem that didn’t exist in the first place, but they are less of an issue in solo battle royale where gathering the necessary cash is harder and the risk of calling in a conspicuous package at a hotly contested buy station is more perilous. The prospect of earning cash itself is at least a fun one thanks to contracts visible on the minimap that task your squad with scavenging supplies, capturing a zone-revealing recon station, or hunting a specific player. The bounty hunt contract reveals the enemy’s approximate location but doesn’t feel unfair since the prey are given ample warning and receive a cash bonus if the hunter fails to seal the deal in the allotted time. These novel mini-missions did a great job of breaking up duller moments and incentivizing movement.  Warzone is a free-to-play mode that launches from within Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, which can be purchased separately. You don’t need to own Modern Warfare to play Warzone, and while Activision claims that owning the base game gives no advantage I would argue that leveling up specific guns to unlock attachments is marginally faster in Modern Warfare’s multiplayer. Warzone’s monetization is therefore the same as Modern Warfare – there is a standard battle pass, as well as a rotating storefront that offers a handful of bundles that come and go to give the illusion of scarcity. These bundles can include cosmetics for an operator or element of the player’s profile, but also blueprints. Weapon blueprints come equipped with attachments whether you’ve unlocked them through regular play or not, so one could make the argument that buying a blueprint gives you a small in-game advantage. But since all the attachments available in blueprints can be unlocked through normal gameplay, I don’t take issue with the system. The battle pass contains 100 tiers with more than 20 tiers being free. That means that if you don’t purchase the battle pass there are still rewards to earn from progressing through it by simply playing. I was surprised at the generous rate at which I unlocked battle pass tiers and can see working through all 100 without too much struggle before the season ends.  On the subject of looting, Warzone does away with the inventory entirely. Instead each player has a resource bar they can pull up to drop things like ammo, armor plates that effectively act as extra hit points, and cash for their teammates. Not having to manage an inventory in the middle of a firefight is nice, and automatically picking up any ammo you come across is even better. This system is a much better fit for the ease-of-use and fast pace synonymous with Call of Duty than Blackout’s somewhat clumsy inventory. The only place where it felt a little fidgety was looting specific equipment from dead players as their gear can sometimes explode around them in such a way that makes it hard to pick up any single item.  Warzone is teeming with new ideas, taking the default squad-based battle royale mode in a more casual direction than Black Ops 4’s Blackout. A large factor that contributes to this less than punishing change of pace is just how easy it is to respawn after dying in what is ultimately a last-man-standing mode. When you perish in battle your teammates can simply buy you back in at a buy station. This can occur as many times as their wallet allows, but it still feels fair since it gets harder to do as the round progresses, the respawning player is marked via a red flare, and, most importantly, it is a deliberate action that someone still in the game has to execute. None of the same can be said for the gulag. The gulag is where you go when you die for the first time – not to the menu to queue for a new match, but rather to the shower room of a prison to take part in a gladiatorial scrap with another dead player for a shot at reincarnation. The weapons are randomized and you only get one chance to redeploy via the gulag. If it sounds fun, that’s because it absolutely is. Even better, while you’re waiting for your turn to fight for your life, you can hurl stones at the current combatants or feed your incarcerated teammate realtime information about their gulag opponent’s location. That last part is pretty scummy, but hey… that’s prison. While the gulag itself is a blast, I’m definitely not a fan of the effect it has on the battle royale taking place outside. You never really know when, where, or if a player has been respawned via the gulag, so getting killed or even just damaged by an enemy that drops on top of you feels terrible, even more so if you were the one that killed them in the first place. On one occasion I died during a teamfight, won my gulag match, and respawned directly over the same firefight just in time to spoil what should have been a clear victory for the opposing squad. While that may have been epic from my perspective, being on the receiving end of such a comeback feels utterly unfair because you’re never sure whether enemies are gone for good or just on their way back in. As a result, kills are neither particularly gratifying or assuring in the squad-based battle royale. The good news is that Warzone’s solo mode completely skirts around this problem by deploying victorious gulag players far away from the location of their death – I wish the default team-based mode followed suit with every respawning player, not just fully-wiped squads. My first win in Warzone came as a result of getting lucky as the gas ring closed directly onto a well-fortified hilltop that my squad and I were defending. It was a hollow victory though since I usually prefer to be aggressive in battle royales, but the more I played the more I realized Warzone’s mid-to-late game just doesn’t reward that behavior, which is disappointing. Unlike Blackout and Apex Legends, which guarantee that slain players drop at least some armor, Warzone has no problem leaving you on death’s door after successfully eliminating multiple squads. That’s because enemies only drop what they have on them, and armor plates and buy stations are naturally harder to come by as the round progresses. In a game like Call of Duty, it doesn’t feel good to walk away from a victorious firefight wishing you had avoided it all together. Stockpiling armor for the end of the match isn’t an option either since you can only hold five armor plates in reserve and it takes three to effectively heal back to full. That means that if a single encounter towards the end of the game doesn’t yield armor plates you’re in trouble. As a result, aggressive players or those forced to fight their way into the circle are punished while campers and opportunistic third parties are rewarded, which just isn’t any fun.  Aside from the squad and solo battle royale modes, Verdansk also plays host to the Plunder mode, which sees about thirty teams of three players competing to collect the most cash in an allotted time. Unlike battle royale there is no circle, you spawn with your full multiplayer loadout, and upon dying you redeploy after a short delay. The goal is to earn cash by scavenging, competing contracts, and killing other squads and then bank it in a helicopter or cash-deposit balloon. I really like the idea of a more freeform objective-based mode on such a large scale, but in practice Plunder does absolutely nothing for me. The fast respawns mean that firefights with the same squad can drag on much longer than they should, and in one match where I was the top contributor on the winning team I hardly fought or came across anyone else. There are some cool concepts here, but in my experience they didn’t translate into fun gameplay. In spite of the serious concessions to depth made in the name of instant gratification, Call of Duty: Warzone’s beta remains thoroughly enjoyable. The battle royale formula is intact, albeit some of the aspects that usually make it so exciting and replayable are muted here. I’d love to see a reason to try something other than my Modern Warfare multiplayer loadout in the future given how easy it is to acquire, and think that the armor plate system and gulag are in need of revision. But my time spent in Verdask was still supremely fun even if the how and the why of it didn’t matter all that much. "
397,My Hero One's Justice 2 ,6.0, One of the most enduring parts of the My Hero Academia anime series, beyond its outstanding characters and heartbreaking storylines, is its insistence that behind the awesome veneer of superheroes is a commitment to rigorous self-improvement. My Hero One's Justice 2 takes some inspiration from that mantra, honing the foundation built by its 2018 predecessor in subtle but meaningful ways while making fights even more fun to watch. But it still can't crack the shallowness and imprecision that limited the first game, making for a fighter that, while more robust, isn't going to convince any naysayers of its greatness. As a 3D arena fighter, One's Justice 2’s balance is based on a simple rock-paper-scissors triangle in which normal and special attacks beat unblockable attacks, counterattacks beat attacks, and unblockable attacks beat counters and blocking. Fights can rely on this triangle a little too much, though, and some matches become a matter of guessing which of those three attack types your opponent will fire off next. Predicting that my opponent is going to throw out a counter and stuffing it with an unblockable did make me feel smart a fair number of times, but after a few matches it got a little stale.     The giant roster helps stave off that boredom, however. It's nearly twice what it was in the original, adding 18 new characters, most of whom are welcome additions that add a few wrinkles to fights. It's cool to see Mirio Togata phase through the floor then come back up to deliver an uppercut, and I'm still trying to wrap my head around Mr. Compress' host of long-range moves and setup maneuvers that make him tricky to play as and against. You can certainly put together your own flashy combos to make things more technical, which is fun to do. And whether you stick to mashing or want to build them yourself, it's easy to at least make each fight look bombastic; even auto-combos look cool and have a weight behind them, and super moves look amazing when you manage to land them. That's a large part of the appeal of a licensed game, and some of the new Team Plus Ultra moves are highlights. The over-the-shoulder perspective, however, can make it hard to keep up with the action. Moves and projectiles might be obscured by obstacles or camera pans, making it hard to keep track of what's going or execute combos, especially as the action moves to corners and up the side of buildings. That, along with some imprecise movement, make judging the radius and range of attacks more difficult than it should be. How far do I need to be to avoid Bakugo's streak of explosions? And if I can dodge it, will my basic attack reach far enough to properly counter before he recovers? I've had some tense fights and some close encounters online, but many others were clumsy, so I wasn't all that invested in them. One's Justice 2 does make some notable improvements to combat over the first game, though. You can now use your assist characters' super abilities instead of your main character's in combat, which is a nice touch. The rest of the combat changes, like dodges and a new stamina system that controls how often you can extend combos with dash cancels and wall-running, are more quality-of-life stuff than anything groundbreaking, but they do make combat a bit more strategic. A new team battle mode lets you put a friend on assist duty in local multiplayer, though we weren't able to test it out for this review (blame the current coronavirus pandemic!). One's Justice 2 also has an extended single-player mode, but it doesn't do a great job of igniting or stoking a love of the source material across its eight hours. Picking up near the end of season 2 and covering most of season 3 of the anime, the storyboarded scenes flow together well enough to let you know what the plot is. But the season's best moments aren't delivered with the vigor they deserve, since you're mostly stuck with stills of the characters. Playing out iconic fights doesn't make them more compelling, either, as I was able to get by most fights just by spamming attacks or special moves, save for a handful of fights near the end. You're better off watching the show or reading a plot synopsis if you just want to know what all your friends are talking about. Otherwise, there’s a new arcade mode that’s a decent way to practice up against CPUs. Mission mode, which has you recruiting heroes and fighting through gauntlets on simple maps, is a bit of a drag. It starts strong, as it does test your ability to manage your health across multiple battles. But its 36 gauntlets are too long-winded and repetitive to be fun for long. That's especially true as the missions get harder, since if you lose even one fight out of several you’ll have to start that entire mission over again. Online, most of my matches had decent connections, though I did see my share of stuttering. I'm more disappointed by the lack of some standard features: neither ranked or unranked matches have a rematch option, so you can't play longer sets against someone who puts up a good fight. You can message them and invite them to a lobby to rematch, but these rooms are limited to two people, which is a bummer. An icon in the online menu also promises themed online events, but it's not active yet, so I can't say for sure if they’ll build on the events in One's Justice. Like its predecessor, One's Justice 2 is good for a few matches with friends. You get to play around with the amazing, expanded cast of characters from the anime and fire off some snazzy special moves and supers. Its minor improvements make combat more fun and the expanded roster offers a ton of new options, too. But if you want to delve deeper than that – whether it's sussing out the intricacies of combat, finding a satisfying solo experience, or getting in some good matches online – this second run at a My Hero Academia game just doesn't put in the work it needs to to be great. "
398,Temtem Early Access ,7.0,"The question at the top of nearly every prospective Temtem player’s mind is, of course, “Is this just a Pokémon MMO?” After spending more than 30 hours roaming this monster-filled archipelago, my answer is “no.” While it clearly borrows quite a bit from Pokémon, Temtem improves upon the creature collecting formula and builds a unique world that makes it an awesome adventure in its own right.   But Temtem sets itself apart and is immediately enticing in its own right through all the ways it drastically improves upon things that have bothered me about Pokémon for since I became a fan of in 1998. Sick of having to delete old moves to make way for new ones? While Temtem honors the tradition of only allowing you to equip four at a time, it lets you slot any abilities your Temtem has learned whenever you want so your Temtem have more flexibility from battle-to-battle. Wish Pokémon had more to do aside from the main campaign? Temtem has a robust library of sidequests. It’s clear that developer Crema thought long and hard about what its team’s dream version of Pokémon would look like and set out to create it – and so far it’s paying off. One of Temtem’s best original ideas is the stamina meter. Instead of a finite number of times each ability can be used before having to heal your squad, Temtem introduces a stat which decreases as abilities are used and increases in between rounds or when Temtem use their turn to rest. More powerful moves require more stamina, which adds some strategy into which abilities you use and when. If you run out of stamina, any further attacks you make eat into your Temtem’s health bar and disable them for one turn until they’ve had a chance to rest. Running out of stamina can be irritating at times and means that you likely won’t get to use your most powerful attacks far less often than a Pokemon player normally would, but the tradeoff is a system that feels better balanced and isn’t just a matter of using your best attacks to knock out the opposing team with a single move. And all Temtem refill their stamina meters at the end of each combat encounter, meaning you never have to turn back and heal up to keep using your favorite attacks. The way stamina plays into combat can be hard to wrap your head around at first, but it’s absolutely awesome once mastered and can turn the tables if used well. Late in my playthrough, I challenged a stranger to a multiplayer match and found, to my surprise, they had a much stronger team. He hit me with his best attacks right away and did some serious damage, but as the match drew on, his Temtem became exhausted. They took damage from over-extending themselves and had to rest while I pressed my attack. Finally, I was able to win the match by the slimmest of margins. I felt like Muhammad Ali doing the rope-a-dope until my opponent wore himself out, then striking back at the perfect moment. That’s a level of strategy and depth that I’ve simply never experienced in all my years of trying to be the very best that no one ever was. All combat in Temtem is 2v2 (unless one or both trainers have only one playable Temtem), which speeds up combat and allows for different Temtem duos to synergize with one another for maximum devastation. For example, a crystal-type Temtem using the Crystal Dust attack will deal additional damage and act sooner when fighting with a wind-type Temtem at their side. Sometimes synergy modifiers completely change the nature of the move, like by poisoning the enemy in addition to the standard effects of the attack. Having two Temtem on the battlefield for every match also improves the usefulness of moves that affect everyone on the battlefield – a feature that’s sparsely used in the series that inspired it. And because you can do damage with one of your fighters and use the other for buffs or debuffs, I foundmyself making use of non-damage-dealing abilities far more often than I do in Pokemon. Abilities that restore stamina, for example, are particularly useful because they can keep the powerful attacks coming for longer. Beyond those mechanical changes, probably the biggest way in which Temtem differs from its inspiration is in the fact that it’s 100% online. That’s awesome in all the ways you’d hope...and less awesome in all the ways you’d fear. It’s great that you can see other players and their Temtem running around the map and interact with them in a number or ways, including challenging them to a battle, trading Temtem and items, or asking them to join you in co-op. Battling and trading are exactly what you’d expect, but co-op in particular is an awesome addition worthy of high praise. By teaming up with a fellow trainer, you’re free to travel together, complete missions and, of course, battle. Since all combat is 2v2, adventuring with a friend feels like something Temtem was built for rather than a tacked-on feature. On the other hand, with an online ecosystem – particularly one that’s still in early access and will be for the foreseeable future – comes disconnects, service outages, choppy performance when the connection dips, and more. It’s nothing rampant or experience-ruining, but it’s undoubtedly there and players who demand the stability of a largely offline experience to the social benefits of an MMO aren’t going to be happy about it. Still, the fact that it’s online makes the world of Temtem feel alive and populated with tons of trainers sporting badass creatures you didn’t know even existed, and that’s well worth the trade-off. Another side effect of the MMO model is that losing battles becomes canon, given that there’s no way to quit and reload to erase a failure. As much as it pains me to admit, I didn’t win every match that I fought and some of those losses impacted the story. While it hurts my perfectionist heart to lose a match and have to live with it, it’s really interesting to suffer a defeat at the hands of one of the story’s villains and have them smugly walk away, leaving me with a bitter, unfamiliar taste in my mouth. The world of Temtem is expertly built and filled with entertaining characters, even when the campaign’s story proves somewhat generic and uninteresting. Set in the floating islands known as the Airborne Archipelago, you’ll encounter a wide variety of unique areas, from volcanic craters to poisonous, lawless wildernesses. Each one is filled with interesting characters that often pull you into cheeky banter before offering a sidequest or challenging you to a Temtem duel. Absolutely everyone has something to say and pre-combat conversation can go on for quite a while in many cases – some of those include multiple dialogue options, though you can usually select one that jumps straight to the fight if you’re not there to chat. Characters are so well-written that I rarely noticed their often low-detail character models and faces, which stand out when compared to the elaborate Temtem themselves. From an enigmatic and silly detective to a smug and sinister countess, characters are wacky, memorable, and make goofy sounds in lieu of spoken dialogue. With such a strong cast of characters, it’s frankly bizarre that the story (so far) seems not to go anywhere. While there are strong sections, like when you get stranded in the wilderness and have to fight for survival, or escape prison and have to make do with a whole new set of Temtem after being separated from your own, each section feels very much like a self-contained story with no real repercussions or larger direction. And because Temtem is a work-in-progress, the story actually...doesn’t have an ending just yet. Partway through your journey you find someone blocking your path and a message pops up to tell you that more is coming soon, and that’s that. It’s to be expected in this circumstance, but I couldn’t help being a little disappointed. That’s not the only reminder that Temtem isn’t complete. You’ll note that some Temtem simply can’t be acquired, find doors all over the place that have “WIP” (work in-progress) signs on them, and hit an arbitrary level cap of 48 late in your adventuring. Another thing I hope Crema works on during early access is that while the Airborne Archipelago is a lot of fun to explore, the creatures you encounter are often less exciting. Simply put, there just aren’t enough Temtem out there, which is one of the ways in which Pokémon’s decades of creatures give it an incredible advantage. Even if the Temtem are well-designed (and most are), you can only see the same handful of creatures pop up in the wild so many times before you’re bored to tears. Worse, each area only has a handful of unique Temtem, which makes battling through the wilds a bit of a slog. It’s only marginally better in duels, where the most powerful Temtem tend to show up quite a bit. What Temtem’s early access version lacks in originality it makes up for by improving upon the creature collection genre with a compelling MMO ecosystem, strategic combat mechanics, and excellent world-building across roughly 30 hours of content. That said, this is the kind of early access game where it’s clearly incomplete, and you’ll find literal work-in-progress signs at every turn. Anybody uncomfortable with a half-baked product should steer clear (but make a note to return when it’s final), but there’s already plenty to love about Temtem for those searching for something that largely improves upon the familiar mold of catching ‘em all. "
399,Doom Eternal ,9.0," I knew Doom Eternal had proven its point when I started taking down Marauders without breaking a sweat, really. These terrifying, devil-horned axe-wielders had been life-threatening challenges when they were first introduced midway through the game, but a while later I delighted in turning the tables on them thanks to some powerful and hard-earned upgrades. Doom Eternal not only retains the wild, high-speed, to-the-brink-of-death-and-back-again ebb and flow of combat that its 2016 predecessor excelled at, it tweaks the formula to introduce more strategy, replayability, and ultimately, satisfaction to this 15+ hour first-person shooter campaign.   Some great games are clever exercises in thoughtful design while others are dumb fun, but Doom Eternal is the best of both. Yes, blasting and ripping demons literally in half with your bare hands is a gleefully, gloriously stupid power fantasy, and Doom Eternal teaches you how to do it better, faster, and in multiple ways as you go. It makes you a smart Slayer. Before long, you’ll be thrown into the meat grinder with dozens of Hell’s denizens at once, including resurrected Doom 2 favorites not seen in the 2016 reboot. Old folks like me remember the Pain Elemental, a semi-dangerous, Lost Soul-spewing cousin of the Cacodemon, and the demon-buffing, pyromaniacal Archvile, which, as in 1994, is one of the biggest threats you have to beat down. Scenes teeming with enemies that would make most other first-person shooters buckle under the pressure, either framerate-wise or gameplay-wise or both, are commonplace in Doom Eternal, and it takes them in stride. In fact, Eternal looks and runs gorgeously on my mid-range PC (i5 @ 3.5Ghz with 16GB of RAM and an RTX 2060), with monsters and environments alike looking much more detailed than they did in 2016. And when you’ve got all those monsters gunning for you, Doom Eternal does something unexpected: it starts to get intellectual in the midst of its carnage. To be effective, you need to start to read the defense like a quarterback at the line of scrimmage, and timing is everything. On a basic level it’s the same game plan as Doom 2016, in that you can largely ignore the pissant zombies, soldiers, and imps at the start of a big fight – you might need to use them to farm for resources later. But in Eternal, many heavy-hitting demons like the Mancubus or Cacodemons have weak points you can exploit. For instance, aim for the former’s rocket-launching arms to disable its guns, then lob a sticky grenade from your shotgun’s secondary fire into the open mouth of the latter and he’ll instantly be vulnerable to a close-up glory kill (and there are dozens of new finishing animations this time around). This opens up a new level of finesse that rewards precision in the heat of battle rather than spraying everything with as much death as possible. Also, Doom Eternal heard you like upgrades, so it’s upgraded its upgrades so you can upgrade while you’re upgrading. As before, weapon upgrades unlock alternate-fire modes and eventually mastery skills; collectible Runes grant up to three passive, hot-swappable bonuses like a speed boost after a glory kill; Sentinel Crystals give new abilities and up your max health, ammo, or armor; Praetor Suit tokens let you choose from over a dozen skills to augment, from grenade improvements to more detailed maps for unlocking secrets. Meanwhile, any foe can be torched with the new Flame Belch suit accessory, causing them to perspire armor shards to help get you ready for the next fight – or save your bacon in the current one. Using it at the right moment is key to pulling off some great victories.  Need ammo? If you can’t find enough around the battlefield, Eternal doesn’t just use the chainsaw as a kill-(almost)-anything, get-out-of-jail-free card – the ultimate melee weapon is once again an ammo generator that can put you back in the game after you’ve run dry and would otherwise be all but helpless as well. So, you can spend your fuel tank cutting down three imps and get fully restocked by a colorful ammunition shower – unless, of course, you choose to empty it in one fell swoop on that one last big guy making your life hell, instantly ending the threat in one glorious cleave. Collectively, these tweaks and additions are a refinement of the fantastic system that the previous Doom struck gold with, but they go a long way toward making the combat feel deeper and more multiple-choice.    The best new weapon, again echoing 1994’s Doom 2, is the Super Shotgun: a double-barrelled duck gun with a meathook attachment that, in a fittingly Doom-y twist, brings you to the target for an in-your-face blast rather than the other way around. That allows for maximum damage from the short-range sawed-off’s twin-shell blasts and also gives you even greater mobility. In all, there are enough new options that it seems like no two Slayers will slay the same exact way, and that makes for welcome watercooler talk with friends as well as genuine replayability. Speaking of secrets, in traditional Doom fashion, Eternal is packed with them. Some tease you in plain sight and challenge you to reach them, while others are tucked cleverly out of the way. Most require your best double-jumping, air-dashing platforming skills in order to reach their location – first-person platforming is emphasized much more in this sequel, mostly to good effect. Rewards range from upgrade points to collectible Funko Pop-like toys of each monster, and the search for them becomes something of a reward in and of itself because of how much fun it is to solve each secret’s little puzzle – not to mention how they serve as a refreshing cool-down period after you finish off another big combat bowl.   Between missions you’ll return to the Fortress of Doom – the Slayer’s Earth-orbiting headquarters/mancave (which, hilariously, has an actual mancave in it that you shouldn’t skip). The Fortress is far too big and empty for what it actually offers, which isn’t much, but it does let you sample classic id Software soundtracks from the past 25 years – and I recommend that you do! And yes, like its predecessor, there is an unexpected amount of actually respectable plot underneath all of the neck-snapping, eyeball-popping madness. Doom Eternal’s story is surprisingly fleshed out, though unfortunately you have to read most of it in menu-based text logs instead of the dramatic, scenery-chewing performance it deserves. I was happy to follow along at first, but by the latter third of my quest to save Earth and all of mankind I’d grown weary of reading log after log and just thirsted for more action. I hope a likely threequel either does a better job of integrating the story into the gameplay, or at least goes the audio log route like so many other games so I can keep playing while I listen to the backstory of the “Maykrs” and the Sentinels. To me, Doom Eternal’s brilliance can be summed up in the road to its first big boss fight, about a third of the way through the Hell-on-Earth quest. It deliberately builds this battle up, taunting you along the way with glimpses of the enemy before it’s brought to life and unleashed upon you. And then when it finally is, and the difficult battle is won, you go through a portal and the gods that are set against you announce, “We’re not through with you yet!” and then you’re immediately launched into an even tougher battle. No respite, no health pickups, no ammo restock – you’re just right back into the fire. And when I persevered, I felt incredible. I’m talking actual, real-life-fist-pumping incredible; I’m not sure I’ve audibly celebrated more while playing a single-player video game – and returning composer Mick Gordon’s new (and once again fantastic) heavy metal soundtrack certainly deserves some credit for that. Simply put, Doom Eternal is one of the best first-person shooter campaigns I’ve played in years. As the second game of its kind it’s lost some of its novelty but none of the joy of its intense and furious combat style. This excellent refinement of the already outstanding 2016 reboot makes you an unspoken deal: if you can keep up with it, it will keep up with you. It continually teaches you how to play faster, smarter, and more efficiently, with lots of options at every step of the way to tailor fights to your prefered slaying style, and it’s an absolute blast along the way. "
400,Animal Crossing: New Horizons ,9.0,"There are so many different types of Animal Crossing players, and yet Animal Crossing: New Horizons manages to improve upon the virtual lives of each player type that I can think of. For The Collector, there's a near-bottomless bounty of bugs, fish, and furniture to gather; for The Designer, there are new tools and few limits to what you can craft and customize. But it’s the The Artists, The Decorators, and The Dreamers who should be most excited: There's an entire island to jazz up, expanding the customizable area far beyond the walls of your house, which is all that previous Animal Crossing games allowed them to tinker with. Throw a swimming pool on the beach; add a giant kaiju statue to your garden; even literally move mountains. You can customize so much in New Horizons that it has me just as excited to see what people create as recent, lauded craft-'em-ups like Super Mario Maker 2 or Dreams. Like past games, Animal Crossing: New Horizons uses your Nintendo system’s real clock, which means many game goals are locked behind a ""sleep wall."" Like the paywall found in some mobile games, which requires you to pay real money for resources to progress, in New Horizons you have to wait until the next actual day to see the bridge you built, or the store you upgraded, or the animal you invited to town come to fruition. There's just not enough to do for these first few days while the sleepy island is waking up. You can't scale cliffs or cross rivers until you satisfy requirements that span several real time days. To make it worse, resources deplete and reset daily, so outside of fishing and bug hunting you can't even effectively farm for bells while you wait. Unless, of course, you cheat it by changing that system clock. See below for my thoughts on that...        Finally, you can place the things you craft and buy anywhere outdoors as well, which represents another huge leap forward in fun customization. You can make a cool beach hangout, or a zen temple on a cliffside, just by dropping things on the ground. The total freedom to create a custom island has me more excited than anything else in New Horizons, and I eagerly await fan community tributes to Zelda, Mario, and other pop culture recreations, along with original designs. I lost myself in island decoration (partially because the act of decorating your island, in turn, unlocks more tools) and began to neglect expanding and decorating my home. But the new home decorator is better than ever as well, with a brilliant new tool to easily place everything without having to handle it, a 360-degree view, and tons of cool, interactive things you can add to your house. Projectors and lamps that you can turn on, turntables and boomboxes to play music that you collect, and even animated wallpaper. The well of things to buy, find, and now, craft, is seemingly bottomless -- and may continue to expand, depending on what Nintendo's unannounced update plans turn out to be.    It's more busywork than fun, and there are no shortcuts: You whack a stone four times and then you pick up each rock. One. At. A. Time. And while you can fortify your tools to be more durable, I've crafted 15 or so fortified fishing rods at this point, each after the last broke at a really inopportune time. (Pro tip: You can carry your crafting bench with you at all times to make a spare tool in a pinch. No need to leave it at home.) Rather than deal with the crafting hassle, I preferred plopping down bells for weird, Nintendo-designed furniture sets and even weirder clothes in pre-made forms from shops. Each animal has a personality type, and their interactions are always cute: They argue with each other, assemble to sing or do yoga, and sometimes give you minigame challenges (like a funny card guessing game) or random gifts. A cool feature of New Horizons is the ability to recruit new animals via a trip to a nearby randomly-generated island, or from the camping site which occasionally spawns a random animal in town. Even cooler is the ability to force a camper to join your campsite with an amiibo card. If you can track down your favorite animal amiibo cards, you can fill your town with only the A-listers.      You can take a day trip to a randomly generated ""nearby"" island, which might have different fruit to nab, but ""nearby"" means the islands you visit are in the same season, so you won't be finding rare winter fish while its summer on your island. This is disappointing, because I loved the ability to go to an offshore island in 3DS's New Leaf. It allowed you to cheat the seasons and nab summer beetles (worth a bundle of Bells!) year round. The nearby islands of New Horizons are a dull substitute.  The Legend of Zelda, Pokemon, and Super Mario each found new life on the Nintendo Switch, and following those games in kind is Animal Crossing: New Horizons: An expanded, polished, next-generation reboot of a classic Nintendo game. Perhaps most importantly, like Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is full of surprises. I cannot wait to see what's to come: Seeing cool custom islands from the community, special events, season changes. It took too long to get to the most exciting part of my island renovation (until I cheated), but now that all of New Horizons is spread before me, I have plenty to do, big plans for my island, and so much to look forward to.

401,MLB The Show 20 ,8.0, Considering the real MLB has recently delayed its 2020 season, MLB The Show 20 literally is the closest you’ll get to real pro baseball for a while. So it’s a good thing it’s great, as usual! That said, this is an annual franchise, and this year’s version isn’t as much of an improvement over last year’s impressive MLB The Show 19 as we’ve seen in big years in the past. But it finally adds some much-desired variety in ways to progress through the excellent Diamond Dynasty card collection mode, expanded customization for its addictive Franchise mode, and further gameplay tweaks to improve what was already one of the best, most dynamic baseball simulations we’ve seen to date.   Where last year’s outfielding improvements made playing the outfield way more dynamic and enjoyable with features like a ball path indicator for top-ranked outfielders, the simulation still needed work, especially when the CPU was in control. MLB The Show 20 takes another necessary step forward here: Outfielders have been dialed in more, and now react more accurately than ever. Your skilled fielders will get a good first-step jump to catch a fly ball, while poor defenders risk fumbling it at the critical moment when closing in on a high-risk catch attempt. This adds to the realism of MLB The Show 20, and it also reinforces the need to keep your hits away from the opposite team’s best field defense.    Franchise mode, where you run your own team just the way you want, is still one of the highlights of this series, so it’s disappointing so little has changed this year. As always, you can micromanage how your team operates, or you can simply let the computer do it all for you while you focus on playing baseball. However, there’s at least one improvement: For the first time, MLB The Show 20 carries over the team customization system from Diamond Dynasty for its Franchise mode, which is a great idea. That said, it’s unfortunate that it isn’t necessarily as well-implemented as it could be. For one, it’s still hard to make a team logo that looks great in its overly complex and unintuitive logo maker tool, but worse, you still have to adopt a real team’s home stadium as your own instead of being able to create your own. Even your season goals are tied to a template based on a real team. As a result, my custom team never felt fully my own. At this point, many longtime fans have been yearning for the ability to craft their own stadiums for Franchise mode, and rightfully so. With the amount of depth given to the character creator, and even the team management simulation itself, it seems odd that Franchise mode still doesn’t give you the ability to design a personalized stadium that shows off your team’s true colors. Finally, March to October, which sorely needed some love before, now has a new Momentum system to heat things up if you’re winning a lot, which affects your win rate between key moments. Likewise, losing matches can kill your momentum or even send you on a losing streak. Incredibly sharp casting from Matt Vasgersian and the like pinpoint key moments in those turnaround games, making it enthralling to turn a losing streak into a winning streak and regain positive momentum once more. This system definitely adds a new layer of emotional investment to March to October mode, compelling you to make it all the way to the postseason. Also new to MLB The Show 20, you can now call-up new and trade your players throughout the season, and it’s particularly cool that you can focus on improving the performance of one player by successfully completing a special challenge match. In what feels like a minor but noticeable update, MLB The Show 20 doesn’t break what wasn’t broken. Developer Sony San Diego has tweaked and tightened everything that was presented in MLB The Show 19, and as a result, playing baseball on a console has never been this fluid. But even with the excellent new Showdown mode, longtime fans may be just a little turned off by the lack of big new changes. That said, those who haven’t picked up an MLB The Show since 17 or 18 will absolutely find that MLB The Show 20 is the best place to pick the series back up. "
402,Black Mesa ,8.0, Black Mesa is unique in all of gaming history in that it’s a fan-remake of the original 1998 Half-Life that Valve has actually allowed to be sold as its own full game. That’s unheard of! It is unquestionably great to have a way to experience such a seminal first-person shooter with a little less of its 22 years of accumulated dust, and almost all of the liberties taken from the original design feel like improvements. That said, the project was in the works for so long – eight years! – that now that it’s finally been declared ""finished"" it feels like it’s a prime candidate for its own remake to bring it up to 2020 standards. As someone who hasn’t replayed Half-Life since Valve ported it to the Source engine (without updating any of the models or textures) back in 2004, playing Black Mesa and fighting off a familiar interdimensional invasion was like putting on some smudged-up rose-colored glasses. Everything looks a lot better than it originally did, for sure... but not as good as I willfully misremembered. Human character models and animations aren’t quite up to the standard Valve set with Half-Life 2 in 2004 (let alone the new bar about to be set in Half-Life: Alyx) and textures are pretty rough in a lot of places. The most jarring thing, though, is the loading screens. Just like in 1998, they too frequently freeze the action as you’re walking down a hallway for around five seconds, even on an SSD. This is an engine limitation the Black Mesa development team at Crowbar Collective likely had no way of working around, but it still makes it feel very old because you just don’t see that kind of thing anymore.  Even so, the atmosphere and action that made the original game so brilliant is brought out and highlighted even more in this version. Welcome liberties are taken to cut out annoying segments of the original and add more of what works. There are noticeably more NPC interactions that are generally well-acted and include in-jokes that reference the original dialogue, along with tons of environmental storytelling for you to stumble across, telling small stories of the last moments of the Black Mesa Research Facility’s less fortunate scientists and security guards. It makes the sterile lab feel more like a real, lived-in (or at least worked-in) place. It’s great to have real physics here as well – after Half-Life 2 it’s hard to imagine a Half-Life game without them – even though they’re very rarely used in puzzles or combat. One addition I’m not wild about is the original music, which chimes in to mark most occasions in which you achieve a major goal. It’s not bad music, by any means, it simply strikes the wrong tone for Half-Life. At least, until you reach the alien homeworld of Xen, at which point it feels much more appropriate. dir=""ltr""  dir=""ltr""     A few times I’ve gotten pretty thoroughly stuck and have had to resort to consulting YouTube walkthroughs. Only a handful of those instances made me facepalm over how obvious the solution was – much more often it’s been more like, “How the heck was I supposed to figure that out?” Fortunately, the puzzles themselves are generally smart and varied, outside of a few obnoxious jumping sections that had me making extremely frequent use of the quick-save button. Black Mesa saves its biggest and most impressive revision for last: the completely reimagined Xen section is definitely the best looking of all of the levels – which makes sense because it’s the most recently constructed. It’s very much its own, distinctively alien setting, and exploring it was novel even for someone who’s played all the Half-Life games. Plus, it can only really be an improvement over the lifeless, floating rocks of the original. It’s definitely worth checking out. Finally, Black Mesa even includes several multiplayer modes… but basically no one is playing them at this point. Whether you played Half-Life back in the day or not, Black Mesa is definitely the best way to experience one of the crown jewels of first-person shooter history. It doesn’t look like a 2020 remake – because it’s not, really – but it still makes great use of the distinctively creepy atmosphere and excellent combat that left such a mark on this genre. And what better way to get ready for Valve finally returning to the Half-Life universe? "
403,Murder by Numbers ,8.0, A detective, a robot, and a drag queen walk into a bar. That’s not the start of a joke, it’s an actual level in Murder by Numbers, a charming visual novel/mystery-puzzler that’s chock-full of charismatic characters and colorful locations. It may land just shy of reaching the admittedly high bars set by its inspirations, but I still had a great time solving this series of ‘90s-style whodunnits. Murder by Numbers’ premise can be quickly summed up as “Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney mixed with Picross,” and if you’re the kind of person who read that and immediately let out a thirsty “Ooo,” then chances are you can probably just stop reading now and buy this game. It accomplishes that simple brief with flying colors, to the point where I can easily recommend it for either of its parts, let alone the sum of them together.  You play as Honor, a TV actress unexpectedly thrust into life as a detective, accompanied by an adorable, scan-happy robot named SCOUT. Honor is an excellent protagonist: smart as a whip but a touch too overzealous for her own good. Watching her grow into a more confident person and adapt to an unexpected new profession as she helps solve a series of murders is genuinely rewarding. Meanwhile, the way in which SCOUT’s strange story unfurls is a little more hamfisted (it is a robot nonchalantly flying around Hollywood, after all), but their peppy and endearingly naive demeanor brings vital levity to some otherwise heavy scenarios. All of Murder by Numbers is set during the ‘90s, and developer Mediatonic has done a fantastic job of capturing and then intentionally exaggerating the iconic look and feel of that decade. Neon colors and wild geometric patterns brighten every area you visit, even defining the style of its UI and menus. Be it a TV set, a fancy award show, or just Honor’s messy apartment, every location backdrop feels distinct and lively – despite actually being conspicuously devoid of any characters who aren’t taking part in the foreground conversation. Thankfully, the characters you interact with are also beaming with personality. Most of them – and there are quite a few – are dressed like they could be walking down a Fashion Week runway that same day, and I don’t think I saw a single character I didn’t love the look of. The character designs, both visually and how the roles they play are weaved into the story of each case to guide you along or throw you off the scent, are top notch. That said, Murder by Numbers does make the somewhat tiring decision to have a majority of the people you interact with be strangely agitating. I know you’re investigating a murder, but so many of your conversations will either be angry, impatient, or flippant, often making SCOUT’s charming jokes an oasis of optimism in a dessert of negativity. There are certainly pleasant and empowering moments, but like in life, you gotta go through the lows before you make it to the highs. Overcoming life’s lows is a running theme of the overall plot, a story that’s more mature than the generally lighthearted Phoenix Wright games. We join Honor at what is essentially the darkest point of her life and watch as she struggles to find her footing again – dealing with a shitty ex-husband, gaining confidence in a new job, and unpacking lots of well-traveled baggage. The smaller stories that make up each of Murder by Numbers’ four cases follow similar themes, intertwining with Honor’s journey while being independently entertaining (if somewhat predictable) mysteries to guess at as you interview suspects and gather evidence. While the Phoenix Wright DNA is undeniably clear here, there’s certainly a lot less of its actual active crime-solving. The story is more on rails in Murder by Numbers, and your job is mostly to find evidence and show it to the right person to move that train along. It’s still fun, but you won’t be given those high-stakes opportunities to yell “OBJECTION!” in the same satisfying way, making most of the big revelations feel like the script’s instead of your own.  Instead of cleverly connecting evidence, you’ll be doing some quite literal puzzle-solving in the form of Picross challenges. SCOUT will occasionally be given the option to scan for clues, which is a fairly uninteresting task that puts an ugly green filter over a location’s otherwise lovely backdrop and has you hunt for an arbitrary spot where your cross hair turns red. It’s a boring but mercifully short process, and finding something launches you into a Picross puzzle where the real fun begins. Full disclosure: I flippin’ love Picross, and this is some good Picross. If you’re unaware, Picross is a visual puzzle in the same realm as Sudoku – you are given a grid with numbers on each line and have to use those numbers to fill in the grid and reveal an image – in this case, a piece of evidence SCOUT is scanning. That “scanning” flavor is really just an excuse to shoehorn in these puzzles, but it’s a cute excuse all the same. While Murder by Numbers is missing a couple of the desirable features I’ve come to rely on from developer Jupiter’s best-in-class Picross S series (small things, like a timer or a way to easily count squares), it’s the closest competitor that I’ve played in terms of polish. It does a decent job of teaching newcomers as well, with plenty of helpful hint systems if you’re more interested in the story and want to breeze past the puzzles. However, one area it absolutely surpasses Jupiter is music. The songs here are fantastic and varied enough to keep me listening for a long time – by contrast, I rarely play Jupiter’s Picross games without unplugging my headphones and listening to Spotify instead. The best way I can describe Murder by Numbers’ bubbly soundtrack is that anyone who unironically loved the Sugar Rush theme song from Wreck-It Ralph will likely be obsessed. I certainly am. You’ll be listening to these songs a lot too, as there are dozens and dozens of puzzles to solve spread across the four cases and beyond – it took me about 15 hours to beat the story, though a few of those were spent doing optional puzzles as well. After an easier introduction, their difficulty stays in roughly the same neighborhood throughout too. Its 10x10 to 15x15 grid size range is the perfect sweet spot for providing puzzles that were big enough to make me think without ever threatening to stop me dead in my tracks when I was eager to continue the story. On the flip side, if I just wanted to solve some Picross puzzles, progressing through the cases unlocks loads of optional ones in the main menu. I’d often dip into these when I needed a break from the dialogue, which made for a welcome retreat. However, unlocking them is strangely tied to a “score” for each case puzzle, which is basically determined by whether or not you use hints. I wish I could revisit specific case puzzles after finishing that case, or see any I may have missed within it, because otherwise unlocking the last of the optional puzzles means annoyingly replaying the entirety of that case. Murder by Numbers successfully blends a Phoenix Wright-style visual novel with a Picross-style puzzle game by making each aspect great in its own right. It may not be the game to dethrone Jupiter from its Picross pedestal, and its somewhat overly linear detective story doesn’t quite reach as high as its Ace Attorney inspiration, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a mystery worth solving. Honor and SCOUT are a wonderful duo to watch grow, and their detective adventures are a heartwarming and undoubtedly fun time. "
404,Nioh 2 ,9.0, I’m not ashamed to admit it, I died a grand total of 409 times during my first playthrough of Nioh 2. Every death is a lesson, which is appropriate because there is a lot to learn in this excellent sequel to one of the first great non-FromSoftware Souls-like games. Nioh 2 takes everything the original game built and evolves it magnificently, adding all sorts of new nuances to the combat – but every gift it gives you is balanced with a stiff backhanded slap of difficulty to keep your ego in check. While Nioh put you in control of a fictionalized version of real-life sailor and Western Samurai (and professional Geralt of Rivia cosplayer), William Adams, Nioh 2 instead goes the route of the mute, custom-created character. It’s a change that actually works well. William was already basically a mute in the first game, so not much on that front is lost, and the character creator in Nioh 2 is amazing, allowing for some truly impressive looking protagonists. But while the story fares better than the first, that’s still not a glowing endorsement. Nioh 2 struggles with making its characters anything more than a means for exposition dumps. The only bright spot is the alternate-universe version of real-life Japanese historical figure Toyotomi Hideyoshi, as his journey from goofy adventurer to fearsome leader and his relationship with your character is actually quite compelling.  Nioh 2’s combat is the star of the show here, and like its predecessor, it is phenomenal. The first and most substantial addition is the ability to use several equippable yokai skills. Borrowing one of the best elements from Castlevania: Aria/Dawn of Sorrow, along with the more recent Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, enemies in Nioh 2 have a chance of dropping a Soul Core. That can be picked up, purified at a shrine, and then equipped to let you use their own move against your foes. It’s an extremely cool addition in a number of ways: First off, it adds rare, exciting loot drops in a way Nioh 2’s equipment system desperately needs, since exotic weapons are dropped like candy; it brings even more tension to the very act of staying alive since you drop your Soul Cores (along with your accumulated Amrita currency) when you die; and most importantly, the moves you get from Soul Cores are fun to experiment with and offer a ton of variety in terms of how you’re able to approach different combat scenarios. Some of my favorites include the universally useful Enki spear throw, which remained my go-to ability when it came to dealing that extra bit of stamina damage required to stun an enemy; Ippon-Datara’s simple hammer slam, which synergized with my magic build as it dealt more damage to scorched enemies; and Ryomen Sukuna’s attack where he would spin forward with his fire and ice swords out, dealing both types of elemental damage at once. While Soul Core abilities are very powerful, they’re kept in check by leaving you extremely vulnerable to follow-up attacks after use. They also drain your Anima meter, which is needed to use Nioh 2’s second most substantial new addition: Burst Counters. Burst Counters aren’t functionally much different than the usual parries that you’ll find in similar games – you time a Burst Counter right before an enemy hits you to stun them momentarily and deal a hefty amount of stamina damage – but what makes them special is how they can only be used against specific, extraordinarily dangerous red-aura attacks, and how just about every enemy has at least one of these attacks to throw out at you with only a second’s notice. These attacks were terrifying when I first started playing, turning even weak enemies into huge threats that could kill me in one belly flop (contributing to that 409 body count), unblockable grab, or flurry of blows. But as I gained experience dealing with them, learning the timing of when to Burst Counter, these once-terrifying attacks became some of my best opportunities for inflicting damage. Reaching the point where something you feared is now something you look forward to is immensely satisfying, especially when dealing with Nioh 2’s many fantastic bosses. There are three different types of Burst Counters: Brute, Feral, and Phantom, and the one you’re equipped with is dependent on what type of Guardian Spirit you equip. The Brute counter has a very slow start-up, but once it gets going it can power through just about any attack and deal massive stamina damage even on its own; the Feral counter is a dash that is especially good at countering other dashes by meeting them head-on; and my personal favorite, the Phantom counter, is a standard parry with an extremely fast start-up, allowing you to react to quick attacks much more easily than the other styles. Certain counters work better against certain bosses, but thankfully Nioh 2 has the flexibility to allow you to change out your Guardian Spirit at each shrine.  At the heart of Nioh 2 is customization. I already briefly touched upon the excellent character creator, but beyond looks, the amount of options you have with regards to every single one of its systems is staggering. There are a total of nine different types of melee weapons, each with their own playstyle and gigantic skill tree, two different types of magic that also have their own gigantic skill trees, and of course, eight stats that scale differently with each weapon and form of magic. In addition to that, every item you get can have its stats rerolled until you find modifiers that suit your playstyle, you can easily change the look of any piece of gear and play “Fashion Souls” to your heart’s content, you can choose from a veritable zoo of guardian spirits, you can customize the look of your hut, and hell, you can even customize the look of your tea collection and have it appraised for some reason. The point is, Nioh 2 is deep as an ocean, and while that’s great in many ways, it can also often be overwhelming and lead to some loot-related issues. Playing the menu game of Nioh 2 is just as important as the one that’s played while in combat, and it can be exhausting sometimes to spend 30 minutes or more going through literally hundreds of pieces of gear, deciding what should be dismantled, what should be sold, what should be saved and offered to a shrine for extra health elixirs, what’s worth keeping around to feed into another item and level it up, and so on. Nioh 2 essentially turns loot into its own currency, which cheapens the excitement of gear-based rewards from boss battles, quest rewards, and treasure chests because the loot is almost never special. Even when exotics drop, it feels like opening a chest in Diablo and just getting a bunch of gold. All of this inventory management is important because – boy let me tell ya – Nioh 2 is hard, and you’re going to need every stat-based advantage you can get. New to Nioh 2 are Yokai Realms, which are areas shrouded with a demonic fog and populated by several powerful enemies. To make matters worse, while fighting in Yokai Realms you have reduced Ki recovery, making it much easier for you to run out of stamina and get your guard broken, which is almost always a recipe for death. On the plus side, you gain more Anima in Yokai Realms, encouraging more liberal use of your Yokai abilities. Once you kill the source of the Yokai Realm, the field will disappear and the enemies within will mercifully no longer spawn even after you rest at a shrine. Even though I’ve shouted my fair share of curses while inside a Yokai Realm, they’re always a satisfying challenge to fight through and the reward of essentially clearing a big area of enemies is always worth the effort.  One of the really smart things about Nioh 2’s approach to difficulty, is that for everything Team Ninja made notably harder, they balanced it with something that makes it notably easier – if you’re able to take advantage of it. Enemies have more dangerous attacks that they use more frequently, but you can turn those attacks into opportunities with the Burst Counter. There are Yokai Fields that dramatically inhibit your Ki recovery, but you can now easily summon AI companions left by other players via Benevolent Graves. Bosses will turn the arena into a Yokai Realm every time you deplete their stamina, but you now have powerful Yokai Skills that regenerate faster while there. It took me about 55 hours to beat Nioh 2, and while every single hour of gameplay was challenging, none of the main missions ever felt insurmountable or made me think that I needed to grind in order to overcome them. However, some of the sub-missions definitely skirted a little too close to the line between difficult and unfair. It’s in these sub-missions where I frequently found myself having to run a gauntlet of tough battles against multiple powerful yokai at once in wide-open arenas where I’m almost always getting hit from off-screen. Or having to fight a boss that was already hard one-on-one, but now I have to deal with it alongside several gun or bow-wielding enemies that like to make my life a living hell. Fortunately, these sub-missions are entirely optional, and none of these situations ever came up during any of the main missions. In those, you can avoid being overwhelmed through careful planning and taking out enemies from afar with your ranged weapons. That leaves many sub-missions as punishing challenges for those who want to take them on for extra rewards, or they can be comfortably skipped and returned to later once you’re sufficiently powerful. Like its predecessor, Nioh 2 also has an exemplary New Game+ mode in the form of its “Dream of the Strong” difficulty setting, which ups both the challenge and the rewards substantially. It even allows you to offer up Ochoko Cups, an item used to summon help into your game, in order to increase the drop rate of Divine items – the rarest of all gear types in Nioh 2. While I didn’t have another 55 hours to push through New Game+ in time for this review, if this sequel is like the first Nioh, it’s safe to assume that further difficulties await. Apart from New Game+, you can also set up expeditions to play cooperatively with two friends, or queue up for a random expedition. Expeditions are essentially standalone missions that you can play with friends that use an assist meter; whenever a player dies, the assist meter goes down, and once it empties, the mission ends in failure. Unless, of course, you’re up against a boss, in which case the mission only ends in failure once everyone dies. Basically, as long as you’re still enjoying playing Nioh 2, there will be more Nioh 2 to play. Also before I wrap this up, can I just say how great it is that Nioh 2’s load times are super fast, even on a base PlayStation 4? In a game that has you dying this much, Team Ninja deserves some sort of medal for putting you back in the action so quickly. Nioh 2 is an impressive evolution of its predecessor, strengthening everything that was already great, while mostly leaving its already existing issues alone. Its stellar combat is elevated by the addition of Soul Cores, Burst Counters, and the ways in which those two main new mechanics affect enemy AI and how you approach battles. It’s depth is impressive, even though that can also make it feel a little overwhelming due to how much time must be spent managing Nioh 2’s many systems. If you’re up to the challenge, Nioh 2 is no doubt one of the most difficult and rewarding games of this generation. "
405,Tom Clancy's The Division 2: Warlords of New York ,8.0, My experience with the Warlords of New York expansion to The Division 2 started out strong thanks to an excellent standalone campaign and a host of very clever revisions to existing RPG systems. The first dozen or so hours were far and away my favorites with the series to date and I can recommend it on the merits of that time alone. Unfortunately, this excellent momentum was slowed considerably by hordes of comically bulletproof bad guys in the heroic and legendary difficulties later on. So while I can’t see Warlords holding my interest long-term, getting to endgame in the first place was still an enjoyable fight.   After landing in the Big Apple you’ll be sent to eliminate a group of rogue Division agents headed up by Aaron Keener, who turns out to be the most interesting villain in the history of the franchise. Granted, that isn’t saying very much at all, but his antics at least begin to scratch the surface of something interesting before quickly falling back into the realm of cliche.   The Rikers and Cleaners make a return from The Division 1 with some formidable new tech, including a firebombing drone and some satisfying old gear like that ever-so-flammable gas tank. I had a blast cutting down old enemies and hunting the titular Warlords who’ve each carved out territory in a different part of the city. Since they can be tackled in any order you’re effectively loosed upon the whole of Lower Manhattan after the introduction, this formula works wonderfully with the familiar and enjoyable open-world distractions like capture points, chests, deviously hidden SHD tech caches, and the collectibles that litter the island. One of my long-standing criticisms of The Division is that its version of challenge relies too heavily on huge enemy health bars and damage outputs and not enough on thought-provoking mechanics. While this unfortunately ultimately rings true once again in the endgame during the campaign I was pleasantly surprised to find that encounters with Keener’s rogues each came along with a unique and bespoke mechanic. While none of their gimmicks had me breaking a sweat, I still enjoyed the novelty of attempting to differentiate Theo Parnell from his many decoys or melting James Dragov with a temporarily activated minigun. This astronomically high time-to-kill coupled with an instantaneous time-to-die has far-reaching negative effects beyond the obvious. It limits the number of viable playstyles, removes any semblance of intuition from combat, and – perhaps – worst of all rewards boring behavior. It’s disappointing to see that even the red-bar enemies, which have historically been easy-to-kill fodder in The Division 2, are now as tough in legendary difficulty as yellow-bars are in hard mode. I revel in a challenge, but this ain’t it. Tuning enemy stats to absurd percentages just doesn’t cut it when so many other shooters are present meaningfully difficult hand-crafted challenges. The frustrations inherent to fighting a roving band of bullet sponges aren’t helped along by the presence of bugs that impact gameplay either. As late as March 9, I’ve encountered unkillable enemies stuck behind walls, capture points or objectives that refuse to progress, and – most annoyingly – the aforementioned inability to revive or be revived by teammates. Needless to say, that last one has ended multiple heroic runs prematurely and unfairly.   The recalibration station may steal the show but there are big improvements to loot elsewhere, too. The way an item’s qualities are conveyed visually has been significantly simplified, there are more exotics to chase and many existing exotics have been revamped, and you can now hunt specific gear by opening your map to see what activity will reward the targeted loot you’re looking for. Unfortunately, the more I played of heroic and legendary difficulty the less interested I became in otherwise fun-to-use weapons like shotguns, DMRs, and sniper rifles. My zealous desire to output the most damage per second in order to cut down the absurd time-to-kill won out over my affinity for these weapons when it became clear that most were simply non-starters on higher difficulties. Much like my initial endgame experience with The Division 2, I quickly found myself listening exclusively to the rhythmic thumping of an LMG. dir=""ltr"" Warlords of New York delivers a mechanically memorable campaign and a beautiful urban backdrop that fits perfectly into The Division 2’s already engrossing open-world gameplay. The excellent changes it brings to loot and progression are sure to have lasting positive effects on the series' future, but they’re currently hamstrung by the oppressive presence of over-the-top spongy enemies in heroic and legendary difficulty, particularly when playing in a group of four. Still, it's hard to ignore that Warlords’ campaign and subsequent activities provided me with about 12 of the best hours I’ve spent playing a Division game to date, even if I can’t see many more of them in my immediate future.
