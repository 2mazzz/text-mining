Lethal Company Early Access ,7,"It’s a heck of a time, running through an abandoned bunker in the dark with nothing but a hazmat suit on your back and three of your closest buds at your side. Oh wait, that’s not your closest bud at all – it’s a grotesque, white-eyed monster eating their corpse and using their body like a puppet. Welcome to Lethal Company, a co-op survival horror game that’s all about digging deep into the (procedurally-generated and largely haunted) crevasses of exoplanetary human history for loot, which your party of up to four companions will need to figure out how to safely transport back to your ship and eventually sell to your eldritch bosses at the end of each round. This is a simple but highly enjoyable premise, and thankfully, there’s enough chaos decking the halls of its current early access version to sink an entire weekend into its depths without realizing you’ve done so. But, even with such a riveting loop and plenty of monsters to make it satisfyingly treacherous, Lethal Company does still feel like the work-in-progress it is thanks to its janky graphics and having little-to-no story to carry it. Each successful run through these abandoned lunar tunnels lets everyone in your squad invest in better gear – like flashlights and eventually high-powered jetpacks – so that you can take on higher-tier expeditions to places like the elusive and extremely dangerous moon of Jupiter, Titan. Inventory space is rather limited – you’re given only four slots in total, and they’re quickly strained when you factor in that you effectively need to carry a flashlight or a walkie-talkie. Both are crucial to survival but difficult to recover if something goes wrong deep inside of a dungeon, where your teammates won’t easily be able to recover your body. At least those items aren’t too expensive to replace.  Regardless, everything in your inventory weighs you down, making it appropriately tough to get away if you’re carrying a heavy load of loot. Thanks to Lethal Company’s plethora of challenges and secret dangers, it’s an absolute blast to try to escape, even when you die horrifically. Even after being blasted to bits by a hidden turret or getting chomped on by one of the many cosmic horrors awaiting me in the twisting corridors, it was still a joy to watch my surviving teammates outrun death. My favorite comic relief moments even took place from the comfort of the death cam – for instance, when one of my teammates tried to haul a big piece of scrap, screaming from the top of their lungs in sheer terror while something chased them across the map. I’ve deeply enjoyed learning how Lethal Company works, getting a little savvier with each run – and even after spending about 15 hours with it, I still feel like there’s plenty left to discover. What’s hiding on the frozen moon of Rend? Has anyone heard about the mysterious ghost girl who only appears to one crewmate at a time before she kills them? How did that guy just get eaten back at base? And, on a side note, why am I gaining experience points and leveling up when there are no unlocks? It’s a little frustrating that Lethal Company raises a few questions like that that it doesn’t yet have answers to. Right now, progression does absolutely nothing, and virtually nothing is carried between save files. That means you’ll need to restart often, even if you survive long enough to reach the endgame in a public group and have to dip out for some reason. But hey, at least there are no microtransactions. Still, Lethal Company already instills a sense of wonder, subtly mimicking the early days of <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/11/24/minecraft-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Minecraft</a> in the way I had almost no clue what I was going to find whenever I selected my destination at the beginning of every in-game day. There are eight different explorable moons, each varying in difficulty – with higher-difficulty moons costing more currency to land on, so you effectively have to ante up before you make your run. The surface of each moon is static, so it’s possible to familiarize yourself with their maps and attempt to plan your route ahead of an excursion. But the real excitement begins once you and your crew enter the labyrinthine underground complexes. Everything from outdoor weather to the interior layout to enemy spawns and loot locations varies between runs, so there’s enough unpredictability to keep you on your toes. For every run, you’re only given three in-game days to find enough scrap to reach your profit quota, meaning there’s a baked-in deadline and you’re racing against the clock. Once it strikes 5:30 PM you’d better be ready to blast off, because the entire landscape becomes a living threat. Luckily, each in-game day is reasonably long, around 10 minutes or so, and I’ve encountered countless moments where I became separated from a teammate as they faced what seemed like a certain death, only for us to rendezvous back at the ship and share our wildly differing stories of how we individually survived and made our way back to safety. But it loses some momentum because there isn’t too much to carry you forward from one run to the next. There’s zero story to follow; progress through the campaign is entirely about surviving to meet the next quota, and that’s it. And even with procedural generation, or maybe because of it, the endless bunkers and basements of Lethal Company’s lowest-tier planets all look alike… and this means they can get stale very quickly. It’s nice that there are a few different types of interior environments later on, but they’re locked behind higher-tier zones that require a bit of time and grinding to earn access to. This means you’ll scrounge your way through tens or even hundreds of abandoned bunkers before you find your way to an abandoned mansion, and I wish those alternative locations showed up earlier. Most of the enjoyment in Lethal Company comes from multiplayer antics. Like any co-op game, communication and coordination are key to carefully planning and executing the safe extraction of loot from the bowels of a dungeon – with all of your party members intact, at least – and all that underlying tension truly reaches its zenith when your initial plan goes awry, scattering your team and sending you running for your lives. Each of these terrifying adversaries have different tricks and strategies, forcing you to adapt accordingly. For example, the shadowy Brakken stalks its prey while shying away from direct light, but it has a knack for easily skirting around corridors in the dark and flanking unaware adventurers. At the same time you have to keep an eye out for the creepy doll-esque Coil-Head, which rushes toward you at lightning speed unless you’re looking directly at it, in which case it freezes in place like a Dr. Who Weeping Angel statue. Most of these opponents range from fairly difficult to impossible to kill, and this is partially because Lethal Company rarely equips you with conventional weaponry. There are no guns here; your best bet is a melee weapon like a yield sign. Thus, combat is largely untenable. Especially against the most challenging enemies, like the giant Forest Keeper or the terrifying jack-in-the-box-like Jester. Most of the time, it’s best to lighten your load and run in the opposite direction. Spicing things up even more, sounds attract the attention of these nefarious monsters – including any noises picked up by each player’s microphone. Setting up Push to Talk is a good way to stay covert when you don’t need to speak, but chatting with your teammates is a fundamental survival tool. This built-in limitation makes every bit of communication significantly more important – you have to keep chatter to a minimum, especially around sound-sensitive monsters like the Eyeless Dogs that prowl the outskirts of your ship at night. Inversely, talking to your teammates over walkie-talkies or while huddled in a group can keep your avatar’s sanity meter from filling up, lessening the chances of monsters spawning in the first place. This mechanic keeps Lethal Company interesting at all times, especially since you can use a particularly loud teammate as a tool to, for instance, draw monsters away from a valuable piece of loot. It’s all made a bit simpler once you’re able to equip multiple party members with walkie-talkies, including at least one who can stay behind on the ship – directing your expedition over radio comms while opening doors remotely and helping you navigate around potential threats by telling you where to go. That said, I found it’s a bit of a chore to sit in the ship and direct everything instead of venturing into the dungeon. At least it gets a bit more interesting after dark when monsters spawn near the ship. This forces the operator to be quiet, otherwise, they’ll invite the unwanted attention of passing creatures who can break in and eat them. Darkness is as much an antagonist as any of the marauding creatures stalking Lethal Company’s hallways. Everything – even the interior of your ship – is dark, dreary, muddy, and deeply unsettling. Most of the time, unrelenting darkness obscures potential threats or even portrays distant team members as oncoming monsters. As in other survival horror games like <a href=""/alan-wake-ii/74598/review/alan-wake-ii-review"">Alan Wake 2</a>, the most powerful weapon at your disposal is often a flashlight, which cuts through darkness and allows you to safely navigate out of harm’s way. Also, it’s smart that Lethal Company’s flashlights both hold a limited charge and can potentially attract unwanted threats when turned on or off, forcing you to be tactical about how and when you use them. To conserve light during one session, all four of my crewmates huddled together and took turns walking in front with a single flashlight, guiding all of us toward the exit like we were a delightfully doomed version of Scooby and the gang. Lethal Company’s constant tension is partially due to its low-fi graphical style, which obscures details and makes everything look like it was rendered on a PlayStation 1. That’s a double-edged sword – especially when low-resolution art, inelegant character animations, and chunky monster designs work against its otherwise gripping atmosphere. Sometimes, what would’ve been a scary moment rapidly devolves into a less welcome kind of comedy when a creature glitches through the geometry of the map. That’s a shame, because the way Lethal Company blends built-in voice chat into its 3D-positioned audio system makes it deftly effective as a survival game with rich horror elements – everything from stomping monsters to the terrified screams of your teammates to a rusty door jarring itself open somewhere down the hallway behind you is all skillfully attenuated to up the spooky ante. There’s nothing quite like a multiplayer survival-horror game that’s as unceasingly spooky as it is hilariously chaotic – and there are few that manage to balance horror and comedy as well as Lethal Company. Even in its early access phase, this co-op loot hunt manages to transcend its limited content and missing systems, making it a good time for those willing to brave its haunted halls – especially with the volume turned up. Still, there’s no real story to speak of, and its tension is deflated a bit by an unappealing and jankily animated art style, overused dungeon templates, and an unrealized progression system that feels as cold and lifeless as the void. We can expect to see a lot of that get improved on during early access, of course. But what it lacks in features right now, it makes up for by offering a strong survival loop that’s satisfying enough to make me want to stick around and see it get built upon. It’s already well worth trying out with a group of buds. "
The Walking Dead: Destinies ,2,"Zombies can be fun to mow down, but they also run the risk of being one of the least interesting monster enemy types around: a slow, lumbering, decaying husk that’s better off buried than occupying our attention. If nothing else, <i>The Walking Dead: Destinies</i>, based off the otherwise fantastic early seasons of the TV show, succeeds in embodying all their worst qualities. In its ugly, shuffling attempts to stand tall even while looking like rotting husk of a game from the Xbox 360 days, Destinies deserves neither your attention nor access to your wallet – and we would be better off if this boring mess had stayed buried in the past, from which it seems to have exhumed its broken mechanics. While it earns a small amount of credit for at least attempting to play with plots that diverge from the TV show, little else is done to elevate it above the muck of banal design, awful character models, and the laughable sense that this is barely a rough draft of a game. Longtime fans of the TV show are clearly the target audience here, since the characters poorly mimic the visual likenesses of their real performers. But aside from trying to strike a chord through recognisability, Destinies presumes you know the entire melody as you’re unceremoniously thrown into the shoes of Rick Grimes after he wakes up in the hospital alone.  It is here – right at the beginning of what became eight to nine painful hours – that everything falls apart. The hospital is, naturally, filled with zombies and Rick must find his way out with some basic mechanics like pushing, sneaking, and healing that we’ve seen in essentially every third-person post-apocalyptic horror game ever, but worse. Zombies are, of course, mindless by design, but these are some of the most incompetent enemies you will encounter in any video game. Aside from there only being about three zombie models, they also get stuck in walls, glitch through the ceiling, collide with each other, and pose about as much threat as a wet sock on a carpet: annoying and unsightly, but otherwise forgettable. Destinies is ugly as sin, with hideous character models, terrible lighting, and homely environments that themselves are re-used multiple times. I have been playing plenty of games out of my backlog from the Xbox 360 days on my Series X lately, and I can tell you this current-gen game looks worse than the nearly 20-year-old GTA IV. The texture resolution reminds me of bad webcams we all endured during early COVID-19 Zoom calls. At the very least, the frame rate seemed consistent at 60fps on PS5, when it wasn’t crashing or failing to display its so-called cutscenes. I also hit several game-breaking bugs, one of which required a full restart. Also, during a boss fight, my character refused to interact with the enemy to initiate a cutscene. Not to mention sound and music would vanish for no reason, until I restarted. Speaking of, the cutscenes themselves are consistent with those cheap-looking placeholder types we’ve seen in games like Redfall and Rise of Kong (which Destinies publisher GameMill was also behind). Characters are displayed in static poses while their voice actors deliver lines, giving you the opportunity to see their terrible designs in full glory. They are clearly meant to vaguely resemble their TV counterparts, but they look like what you’d get if you asked me to draw them from memory. Strangely enough, the voice performances are actually not atrocious, but the actors didn’t have much to work with. For example, they all have one-liners when taking down enemies or fighting them off – “My blood’s boiling!” “Get off me!” and so on – all of which repeat endlessly. In the context of a dangerous world of constant terror, hearing weird action movie one-liners from both an ex-cop and a 70-year-old farmer was jarring. Destinies doesn’t even retell the show’s story well. For example, early on when Rick’s son Carl is shot, it is never explained who shot him, and no one seems to know or care. At all. In fact, Otis, the culprit in the show, never even appears in Destinies. Instead, the survivors simply grab the boy and run off to the Greene farm story arc that infamously slowed the series’ pace down. The only thing Destinies has going for it is being able to play with the titular dynamic: the fates of its characters. There are many occasions where you must make a binary decision that leads to the death or abandonment of a survivor. If you know the show, it is of course enjoyable to make the decision that runs against the established plot. Most notably, you can basically recast the main character, choosing who wins the fight between Rick and Shane after they spend some time on the farm, letting Shane can take over as husband and father to Rick’s family. That’s a pretty dramatic, fundamental change! It's clear the developers had some love for the show, given the work put in to portraying Shane as we’ve never seen him. His hair and beard grow out, he forms relationships with characters he never met, and so on. Another good example of an impactful decision involves changing who becomes the final boss’s right-hand man, flowing from a decision you make in the first few hours. But, unfortunately, this is only interesting conceptually, since it still fails miserably in execution, and naturally most decisions do little to affect the actual plot. The survivors move through different camp areas in their grand road trip, such as the previously mentioned farm and later a prison. These become hub areas where you do three things: start the next main and side missions, resolve a meaningless conflict between two characters, and “talk” to other survivors. And by talk, I mean each person will say one arbitrary, generic line whenever you go back to the hub area, offering no reflection on the events happening around them. For example, Rick's wife Lori will tell the man who blew her husband’s brains out about how she enjoys making pancakes for the family on Sundays. Each main mission usually sees you playing as a different survivor. Often this makes little sense, since you’re generally by yourself or playing as the worst person for the task at hand. For example, a few hours into Destinies, Lori gives birth in the prison – but a few minutes later you’re playing as her to recover items from a nearby department store. There were <i>many </i>other survivors who did not just endure a birth in a zombie apocalypse who could have gone, but sure, let’s send the new mother. No explanation is given. Another time, a 70-year-old farmer is sent – alone – to recover an assault rifle and ammo in the basement of the prison. You’re never told why someone who actually handles weapons – like a younger, more agile police officer, for instance – could not have gone instead, or at least accompanied the old farmer. Destinies attempts to shake up the scenarios in its main quests, but they all come down to either getting to a specific part of the map or collecting items. Very rarely will two characters be together, assisting one another – which was a central focus of the entire show and its spinoffs. There was an opportunity to have one character make decisions that a second character would have to endure the consequences of, but Destinies does nothing with this. In fact, it’s just not very good at consequences in general. The central and titular dynamic of Destinies is watching your choices define the lives of these survivors, but it doesn’t function well enough to maintain the illusion. More than once, I saw characters I had killed – deliberately or inadvertently – appear during cutscenes. Rick’s son, who died from a gunshot in my playthrough, was running from the farm in a static cutscene; Rick himself, who I had Shane kill, appeared for a solid few seconds battling the horde in the final fight. This may be a universe where the dead return from the grave, but I don’t think Destinies is doing it right. Each survivor has various unique skills that can be upgraded by acquiring skill points, either through completing tasks or… finding radios, for some reason? For example, the pizza delivery guy can upgrade his sneaking movement speed to avoid conflict with zombies, or Rick’s revolver can do more damage. The skill tree is a massive eyesore, and ultimately meaningless – in the first two hours, I had already maxed it out for everyone. Even fully upgraded, combat in Destinies is some of the worst you will experience, and feels as though it might’ve been lifted from shovelware of previous console generations. There is no kickback or feel to guns or melee weapons. Shooting is floaty and unresponsive, with terrible auto-lock that has you targeting enemies nowhere near you. Every character has the exact same set of moves, whether they are a fit hunter or a new mom. Characters can use a kind of super move when they’ve built enough “adrenaline”, which restores health and kills enemies instantly, but that also feels pointless when you’re fighting zombies that are so slow and die in two hits. You do eventually begin to encounter tougher human enemies, but their armor and agility just means they are more irritating and take longer to kill. Oddly, they are also introduced out of nowhere and not spoken of at all. They first appear during Shane’s only flashback sequence to when he was trying to rescue Rick from the hospital – who are they? What do they want? Why are they attacking Shane? Sorry, you’ll never know if you haven’t watched the TV series. Shane himself never reacts to it. A boring, ugly mess of a game to be avoided at all costs, The Walking Dead: Destinies fails to do anything interesting with the story and characters of the popular TV show it’s based on. While the ghost of a promising concept haunts the periphery – that of making choices different from what happened i the early seasons of the show and watching them play out – its horrendous graphics, weightless combat, repetitive mission design, and as many bugs as zombies reduce Destinies to the gaming equivalent of a biological hazard.

SteamWorld Build ,7,"I'm not sure I've seen a more original premise for a city builder than ""grow a frontier boomtown populated entirely by retrofuturistic steam-powered robots"" in a long time. That makes SteamWorld Build a refreshing drink of water in a trackless desert compared to the many, <i>many </i>trend-chasing builders we've seen over the last few years – and while you build a town above, it sets itself apart further by having you simultaneously excavate a mine below in search of both mineral resources and pieces of ancient technology that can be used to escape your dying planet. It's a short, sweet city builder that doesn't do too much new beyond that setup, but uses the parts it has to make a fun whole I know I'll revisit in the future. As has been the case for a decade, the SteamWorld games have a really well-established palette of character designs, colors, and even sounds to draw from. The result is a game world stylistically on par with much larger, more established franchises — like the Warcraft universe — that adapts really well to different genres without losing its visual distinction, personality, and setting. That’s still true in SteamWorld Build, where the goofily stylized robots that chug along to the same twangy country-western guitar tracks with the same silly voices are as charming as ever. It's a planet of steam-powered robots that all have accents like a Scandinavian person pretending to be from the old west, and by God does it still work here.  SteamWorld Build's central rules are nothing new in a city builder. You provide citizens with services and produce goods, both of which let you eventually upgrade those same citizens to higher tiers – Settlers to Engineers to Aristobots to Scientists – and unlock new buildings that offer even more stuff for that next tier of bots. If you’re looking for a deep simulation of each citizen's needs, you won't find anything like that here, but the simplicity is a strength in its own ways. Fans of series like Anno will pretty quickly get what SteamWorld Build is doing and almost surely enjoy it, as will those like me who remember the older Impressions City Building series. Services are routed to your metallic folk through a basic system of distance: Everything moves over roads you’ll lay down, and any house in range of a service building immediately has access to it. Goods are produced at a specific rate, and you can stockpile some, but mostly you'll rely on having just as much coming in as going out, trading excess away at your town’s train station. But it’s not entirely cut and dry, as your town simultaneously spreads underground. You’ll recruit miners, prospectors, and mechanics to excavate, extract, and improve your mining works. At first you’ll focus on finding easily-removed chunks of ore in dirt and rock, but later you have to supply expendable tools like pickaxes and drills to remove harder stone obstructions. And while the resources you find above initially support the mine works, eventually that flip-flops as the town needs the oil, water, and old tech you excavate below. There’s a simple yet satisfying loop as engineers from the town help you recruit mechanics to work underneath it, who then install and maintain auto-extracting machines on resource veins you find, growing your tunnels further so you can expand more, and faster, both above and below. You'll eventually need security bots to keep the underground works functional and safe from whatever monstrous bugs and ancient threats you might dig up. They’ll help protect your miners proactively, but you can also build traps and turrets to scare off enemies and defend your static base. It's a sort of Dungeon Keeper lite, where the threats generally aren't threats at all until you dig them up on purpose, letting you take on fights at your own pace – at least, at first. That's on top of a welcome range of difficulty settings that can make enemies anything from pushovers to a real, consistent threat. That’s a strong design decision for the kind of lowkey city builder SteamWorld Build is, where disruptive attacks could end up feeling more annoying than challenging. The fact that it uses enemies as speed bumps to smooth out the pace of progression instead of a constant gauntlet to worry about is nice. As you dig and build, the train station aboveground also gets regular visits from out-of-towners. In classic old west fashion, this is a source of both money and things you can't otherwise make yourself: Building upgrades. Most buildings have an open slot or two to boost them, such as warehouses getting more storage space and workers to haul goods, resource producers getting a chance to make bonus items, or even just new picks and guns for the bots in the mines. You can also trade away excess goods for cash, which is nice. These upgrades are very simple, not complex enough to provide diverse build strategies to each new run, but they support your experience in a key way: If you don't enjoy figuring out ideal production rates, for example, you can just invest in bonus production and not think about your underperforming cactus juice farms ever again. From start to finish, it only took me about eight hours to build a town, excavate the mines, and construct a rocket to escape SteamWorld. This is a quick and simple city builder, which is both its greatest strength and what holds it back from being so much more. There are five maps with different terrain to work around, but the decisions you have to make while doing so aren’t otherwise going to change very much. You'll build the same stuff every time with little variation. Making your way through the production chain and exploring those maps is plenty of fun – but it's just the one kind of fun, not a deep and engaging puzzle that unfolds and draws you deeper over time. It does get a lot of beginner-friendliness and approachability from its decision to embrace simplicity. That's evident, for example, in the fact that developer The Station has actually managed to deliver competent controller support, unlike a lot of other city builders that only vaguely succeed at it. That's not to say there aren't any unpredictable elements or new things to unlock and do the longer you play, either. Each map can be played with a randomly generated underground layer, which is a nice touch that keeps the mine-building fresh. Beating a map also unlocks a permanent upgrade to future towns' infrastructure, like a boosted train station that has shipments come more often. Nothing too special, but it is a bit of a victory lap that cuts down on busywork that'd be annoying to repeat. It's also a space-saving convenience that frees up time to make your towns pretty with decorations. Nothing like a neatly-appointed rail line to keep up steambot morale. SteamWorld Build is an enjoyable little city builder that doesn't give you grindy busywork or overstretch itself with bloated padding, focusing on a solid foundation of laying out a city and providing it with supplies. Its underground layer is a cool additional system that has you expanding, improving, and defending your mining operation in a way that matches the laid back pace of the surface nicely. At the same time, SteamWorld Build’s simplicity cuts both ways, and there isn’t much variety on return trips aside from fitting the old bits into new maps. That makes it a refreshing city builder worthy of a few fun weekends, but not a particularly deep one I’m likely to boot up year after year. "
Bluey: The Videogame ,4,"The very same weekend we received Bluey: The Videogame, Australia’s ABC broadcasted a countdown of the top 100 Bluey episodes, as voted by the public. Tuning in for the final 20-or-so, it was the perfect opportunity to catch up with any of the very best ones I’d managed to miss over the years ahead of this review. One of those was Onesies, and I was floored when the theme was revealed. Seriously, the ability of this children’s show to tackle a concept as complex as infertility for an audience of any age, and with such an expert balance of levity and empathy, is nothing short of remarkable. There is so much to this show beneath the surface. I do wish I could say the same about Bluey: The Videogame – that it, too, is quite remarkable in its own way. Unfortunately, it is not. It may look like a spot-on recreation of Bluey’s gorgeous and distinct 2D animation, but beneath the surface there isn’t much more than an hour or so of mild multiplayer fun and moderate frustration. As I’ve touched on, Bluey the show is a rare breed; colourful and cute enough to entertain its core audience of preschoolers, witty enough to hook older kids and deliver valuable lime lessons without ever patronising either audience, and regularly profound enough to make their parents cry. On a more superficial level, though, it’s rare because it’s also beautifully animated in 2D. While I admit I probably don’t quite have my finger on the pulse of pre-schooler TV these days, if it’s still anything like it was a few years back this is in stark contrast to most shows for four-year-olds – which tend to look like time capsules of PS1 game cutscenes exhumed from 1997.  Bluey: The Videogame does an admittedly terrific job of emulating the bright and chunky look of the show, and it effectively converts the four available backdrops into 2.5D environments that bring depth to places like the Heeler home without jarring with the show’s usual look (which is typically staged on a single plane). The characters and animations are equally accurate, and they’re more or less indistinguishable from the show itself. It helps a lot that the cast is also aboard to provide the voices. Unfortunately, that’s largely where the good stuff stops. Perhaps the biggest problem of all is the absurdly short length for what <i>isn’t</i> some two-dollar tablet game you download on a whim to keep a toddler busy while you’re waiting for your spring rolls. At £35 in the UK, $60 Australian, and $40 US, it is <i>brazenly expensive</i> for a game that can be completed in under an hour, and picked clean of collectables in less than two. We try to keep price out of the conversation in a review because games don’t get better when they go on sale, but exceptions must be made in cases like this where it’s just a ripoff. There are just four maps – the Heeler house and backyard, the playground, the creek, and the beach – and a short story arc split into four 10- to 15-minute episodes. Developer Artax Games has divided the Heeler backyard and house in the menu to make it appear there are five maps, but that’s not the case; obviously, the house and backyard are connected. It is a tiny amount amount of extremely modestly sized maps. No shops, no succulent Chinese restaurants, no school, no Hammerbarn – it’s the bare minimum all the way. The setup is cute enough; it’s the school holidays and Bluey and Bingo are spending it on the hunt for a forgotten treasure buried by Bandit and his brothers when they were kids. As such, there are appearances by Uncle Stripe and Muffin, Uncle Rad, plus Chilli’s father Grandad Mort. There’s even a low-hanging moral brushed against in the fourth and final episode, which culminates at the creek, but then the story just… ends. The beach is unlocked, but there’s no story component here – even though there feels like there should be. It just doesn’t actually feel finished. It doesn’t feel particularly well-finished when it comes to how it plays, either. I played through in co-op with my kids and our experience was mostly fractured, finicky, and frustrating. There were times our characters were frozen and only returning to the character screen to re-select our characters would fix it. Lining up objects to interact with and pick up is a hassle, which is doubly annoying considering the solution to every puzzle is pushing or pulling a piece of furniture. Or maybe a rock. Platforming is imprecise and inelegant in the 2.5D spaces, and while it does seem to only need one of you to succeed, this is a pain in groups of three or four players. In bigger groups, progression is messy – it’s really just a melee of everybody spamming the interact button to gather junk and getting teleported along by the first person to successfully make a few jumps. Each of the four episodes also introduces a separate minigame that can be started and played from a dedicated game wheel, including Keepy Uppy (keeping a balloon off the ground, which is dreadfully underwhelming in practice), the platforming-based Ground is Lava (which had a habit of trapping me in a glitched state where I couldn’t move), Magic Xylophone (which is basically freeze tag with an extraneous musical instrument), and Chattermax Chase (which is essentially Baby’s First Oddball. You kids know what Halo is, right?). Unfortunately, these minigames are scrappy and rudimentary at best, and we really didn’t find ourselves drawn back to any of them. If anything, we gleaned the most fun out of exploring the Heeler home in free-roam and hunting through all the recognisable rooms, but even that was short lived. With 151 episodes of Bluey in the can, the list of places and pooches Bluey: The Videogame could’ve featured is extensive. What we have feels like barely half a game. It’s a bewilderingly unimaginative take on the most canny, creative, and considered kids show I’ve ever seen, and it’s extremely trifficult to recommend. Wedged somewhere between Wi-Fi and The Wiggles as one of Australia’s greatest exports, Bluey has been a staggeringly successful animated series. Tens of billions of minutes of the show have been streamed into households in more than 60 countries, and the Heelers have subsequently been transformed into over 1,000 bits of merchandising tat. In an unfortunate turn of events, Bluey: The Videogame feels a lot like another forgettable piece of the latter, hovering somewhere between the countless toys and the tubes of licensed toothpaste. Low on innovation and high on what feels like contractual obligation, Bluey: The Videogame is really a low-effort mobile game masquerading as a mid-price console and PC product. It may absolutely look the part compared to the show itself, but with its assortment of shallow minigames rife with annoying bugs, frustrating controls, and a bafflingly brief runtime of a little over an hour, everywhere else it’s a dog’s breakfast.

Naruto x Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections ,5,"Like the four Ultimate Ninja Storm games before it, Naruto x Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections is a comprehensive ode to the world and characters created by Masashi Kishimoto. Its immense cast of playable characters, each with exceptionally well-animated movesets, and a heaping handful of maps ripped straight from the anime with loving detail look better than ever before. But no level of source material accuracy can save this absolute mammoth of a game from hollow single-player content and a stale combat system that hasn’t meaningfully changed in fifteen years. As far as Naruto fans go, I’m a bit of a weirdo. I was actually first introduced to the series ten years ago through <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/20/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-3-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Ultimate Ninja Storm 3</a>, and I still vividly remember marveling at that entry’s shockingly big roster compared to most fighting games. That spurred me to get caught up with the show, and then I found myself further hooked thanks to the story mode’s faithful recreation of that fictional world. But while I stayed a Naruto fan, my friends and I eventually moved on to games with more depth, like <a href=""/super-smash-bros-for-nintendo-switch/21125/review/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review"">Super Smash Bros</a>. That’s because in order to support a roster that’s aptly described as a literal storm of ninjas, the combat has to stay pretty simple. This makes it approachable and easy to master, but there’s also no pot of gold to chase at the end of this learning curve like there is in better fighting games.  Combos flow like a watered-down version of Devil May Cry or Bayonetta; you can add variations to your moves, but most of the time you’ll be pressing the single attack button until your combo ends with a flashy finisher – unless you’re quick enough to cancel it into a special move or a dash before rinsing and repeating. Combo finishers usually end by launching your opponent across the map into the ground, putting them out of reach from a follow-up dash. This is where the real game begins: you’ll need to master and understand the ebb and flow of blocking, attacking, grabbing, and moving to get up close and personal so you can lock your opponent into yet another devastating flurry of blows. Most of the characters in these games are (unsurprisingly) ninjas, which means they’re highly agile and each have three magic abilities to show off in the heat of battle. Just about anything goes here: Kiba teams up with his trusty pooch Akamaru to rush down and drill his opponents into a pulp, Kisame shoots shark-shaped water bombs from a safe distance, and Raikage Ay slams with thunderous force, creating a massive shockwave. But the drawback of that shared ninja DNA is that, aside from the stray puppet user like Chiyo or Sasori, most characters draw their movesets from the same small pool – albeit with different coats of paint. With 130 playable characters (though many of them are duplicates of main characters, with one or more extra variations of the same person taking up a lot of real estate), choosing a character based on their playstyle is less important than choosing a character you like from the show. That roster sounds impressive, but it actually feels barren as a fan, with only a few characters from Boruto, most of whom are just grown-up versions of other playable fighters. For something that’s billed as a definitive celebration of the whole series, Ninja Storm Connections falls disappointingly short. Playstyles are generally so similar too that you could swap most characters’ voice lines and models with another and not see a huge difference. That said, using each character to their fullest potential takes a lot of savvy resource management and patient play, which is where Ninja Storm games shine. Using these special techniques consumes chakra, the Naruto series’ life-granting spiritual essence. On top of that, you’ll also need to keep an eye on your substitution gauge, which allows your character to escape any combo or attack at the push of a button. But you only have four substitutions at your disposal, and using multiple will cause your gauge to refill very slowly. This all adds some extra sauce to the otherwise one-note combat as players dash and jump all over its 3D arenas. Ninja Storm Connections seeks to further streamline the series’ combat for people who want a more forgiving fighting system by adding in the Simple control mode. By pressing a single button, your character will control itself, deciding when to dash, use special moves, and execute combos, leaving you to simply move and block. It’s great for people who love the show but aren’t into fighting games, but not something that will ever match up to an experienced player. It’s also highly customizable, allowing you to select what’s automated and what isn’t. Playing online has been pretty smooth thus far – though results will vary depending on your own and your opponent’s internet connection strengths and speeds since Ninja Storm Connections disappointingly doesn’t use rollback netcode like a majority of other contemporary fighting games do, instead opting for a peer-to-peer connection. In most cases, this makes for a less reliable option that often results in a worse online experience. Netcode aside, the multiplayer options offer a solid range of online features including multiple opponent rating systems, with fail-safes for players who disconnect during a match or engage in toxic behavior. For a fighting game with such broad appeal, that’s a fantastic approach to curbing the poor behavior that permeates a lot of the casual arena fighting genre. Its single-player story options, on the other hand, are something of a letdown. The History Mode lets you poorly relive the story of Naruto and friends from the beginning of the original series, which follows him as a kid through the end of Naruto Shippuden three years later. Special Story Mode, on the other hand, is a predictable and rarely exciting original story written by series creator Masashi Kishimoto set in the time of Naruto’s son, Boruto, whose own manga series is still ongoing. I love the world and story of Naruto. Its complex politics, incredibly fleshed-out history, well-defined characters with rich backgrounds, and interweaving relationships are the foundation of why this series has remained so popular over the years. Unfortunately, Ninja Storm Connections’ approach to that story does it no favors. Parsed out like a half-baked flashback, History Mode truncates the events of Naruto and Shippuden in slapdash fashion. Yes, these games are designed with the fans in mind and most of the people playing through its roughly seven-hour recap will probably already know these events like the back of their hand, but that doesn’t excuse shoddy storytelling. Instead of cutscenes, subtitled stills from the anime pop up in-between the occasional fight, with sound effects like clashing kunai and some sporadic screen-shaking as the only attempts to add flavor. I’m sure it’s challenging to condense entire arcs spanning dozens of episodes into roughly 40-minute-long chapters, but I’m equally sure it could’ve been done in a more interesting way than this. These “movies,” as the game refers to them, are narrated by the Naruto world’s god-like figure, The Sage of Six Paths. This detached perspective, delivered in English via voice actor Michael McConnohie’s hypnotic rasp, is great in a vacuum, but boring in the broader context of a series that involves so many distinct characters and performances by talented voice actors. And that’s if a given movie is fortunate enough to have <i>any </i>voiceover whatsoever. You’ll rarely hear from the actual characters involved in these moments, which play out more like YouTube lore videos than interesting scenes. Instead, whenever a memorable quote comes up, our disembodied narrator reads it like he’s a teacher reading a book to a group of kindergarteners. In the same way that a poorly-placed repeated flashback can deflate the tension of an intense moment in an anime, so too can a comically offbeat line read. This isn’t through any fault of the narrator’s performance – he’s doing his best with what’s been given to him. This is a fault that sweeps this entire mode’s framing, which is just not a good way to retell this show. That’s especially true compared to past games, which saw you take a much more active role in playing out these stories. In the case of the first three Ninja Storm games, you controlled a character through an entire open overworld that represented a smaller-scale version of the shinobi world where Naruto is set. It helped reinforce the sense of place that makes the world of Naruto so noteworthy. Layering extra side missions and hidden collectibles on top of that open world further established the sense that you were actually part of it, not just looking on as a passive observer who occasionally picks up a controller to shoot out a Rasengan. That all changed in Ninja Storm 4, and Connections picks the disappointing mantle right back up. All side objectives and collectibles now come in the form of samey battle objectives, which include a very limited range of tasks like ending a battle with a certain amount of your health bar remaining or finishing your opponent off with a specific type of move. Considering just how many battles you compete in throughout Ninja Storm Connections’ single-player content, you’re likely to see every possible special challenge within the first hour or so. Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 refines the gameplay to the absolute best of the series and offers a large roster of playable characters. Unfortunately, it squanders all of that potential with a short and poorly presented campaign fought against buggy AI, a forgettable Adventure Mode and online matches that are plagued with connectivity problems. - <i>Jakejames Lugo, February 9, 2016</i Read the full <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/10/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-4-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 review</a>. Reducing the History Mode down to dialogue sequences with random fights was bad enough in the last Ninja Storm game, but Connections adds insult to injury by passing up the opportunity to retell Boruto’s story in order to spend time on a middling side adventure instead. Part of the Special Story mode is set within ‘Ninja Heroes,’ a fictional, in-universe video game based on the characters and events of Naruto, and that’s where things really go off the rails. It’s an online multiplayer game where Boruto and all of his friends gather to hang out; think Fortnite if it featured skins based on war heroes instead of Master Chief and Chun-Li, but for this fictional world. There’s almost no discernible story in Ninja Heroes, and the only thing Boruto &amp; company do in it is fight – but you’re not even forced to use these newbies. In fact, you could play most of this mode’s fights as any character you want because the full base roster is available. Peeling away the layers behind this game’s existence only adds to the confusion; for example, one of Boruto’s friends makes his in-game avatar that of Deidara – a former member of the Akatsuki, a murderous terrorist organization that was responsible for killing droves of people – and nobody bats an eye. It’s as confusing as it is strange, but never strange enough to be compelling. Ninja Heroes is quickly revealed to be a Trojan Horse that’s part of a greater plan to take over the world, but there’s just nothing interesting about it until the characters leave this digital space and realize something’s amiss. It’s about as silly as it sounds, and mostly just acts as an excuse to toss loads of purposeless fights at you for a large chunk of this story. In fact, there’s even a section that tries to make fun of how unapproachable and content-dense some MMOs can be by throwing a long series of fights at you, but the joke misses its mark and inadvertently becomes the very thing that it sets out to make fun of. Part of what makes the fights in other Ninja Storm story modes so fun is re-living the dramatic character moments that bookend these same fights in the anime and manga. Playing a bad fictional video game that doesn’t have a story as a part of real life video game’s paper-thin story mode is about as dry as you’d expect. Thankfully, this side adventure doesn’t swan dive headfirst into that empty swimming pool. Instead, it does eventually get somewhere more interesting, with real stakes, political intrigue, and plots to plunge the world into warring chaos, but its first third is such a painfully dull slog that nothing can truly redeem it. One bright spot opposed to the History Mode, however, is that characters are fully voiced, and there are several well-animated cutscenes. The opening one, in particular, is a stunning display that cleverly left me excited to see more. Seeing Naruto and Sasuke fighting is nothing new, but using it as a way to set up a mystery involving a role reversal between the two, with Naruto seemingly turning coat, left me wondering more about where this story was going and how things had led to that point. I just wish it never dropped that initial sense of action and intrigue. Naruto x Boruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections may have the biggest roster and flashiest graphics in the series, but its unenthusiastic re-telling of the source material in what should be a celebration of Naruto, Shippuden, and Boruto falls flat. Even when it’s fun and nostalgic, there’s almost nothing here to make me seek it out over past entries with basically the same fighting system and better single-player stories. If all you want is the newest, biggest, and shiniest way to watch your favorite shinobi battle it out, Ninja Storm Connections at least delivers that. But just because it understands the assignment doesn’t mean its execution gets high marks. Even as someone who dabbles in annual series like Call of Duty and FIFA with friends from time to time, this is the most “just another one of these” games I’ve played in a long time. "
Super Mario RPG ,8,"Odds are good you’ve seen Mario stomp a goomba or kick a koopa shell before, but you might not have seen him punch a giant lady with a parrot for hair right in the shins while she sips a cocktail and rides a floating banana. Super Mario RPG is easily one of the quirkiest adventures the mustachioed plumber has ever been on, rightly becoming a standout when Final Fantasy developer Square first released it nearly three decades ago. Its 2023 remake is an incredibly faithful recreation of that already awesome RPG, with a fresh coat of paint and some small but smart combat updates. Those changes can’t completely shake off 27 years of dust, but they do provide a fantastic way for fans like me to revisit this classic while also letting new folk better enjoy just how wild it is firsthand. Bucking the usual setup, this entertaining story kicks off with Mario rushing to Bowser’s keep and immediately rescuing a kidnapped Princess Peach – but before they can return home happily ever after, a giant sword with a face crashes through the castle roof and sends all three of them flying. From there, Mario has to fight lots of living weapons up to no good and collect seven Star Pieces in order to save the Mushroom Kingdom. It’s not a long tale, taking me just about 12 hours to finish (though I’ve done so on SNES before), but the writing is so consistently funny and often off-the-wall that this essentially-unchanged script still had me frequently laughing out loud.  Super Mario RPG’s turn-based combat is extremely straightforward, pitting your party of five against all sorts of weird and creative enemies – from your standard Mario monsters like goombas to the skeletal corpse of a mastodon that has literally zero explanation. It fuses timing-based button prompts into your otherwise recognizable mix of basic attacks and resource-limited spells, satisfyingly giving you an extra boost for a well-timed A-press on offense and reducing damage (or even negating it entirely) on defense. This system still rocks, and it’s easy to see why it influenced so many games that came after it – be that Mario’s own RPG outings in the Mario &amp; Luigi and Paper Mario games, or more recent successors like the <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/04/south-park-the-stick-of-truth-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>South Park RPGs</u></a> or this year’s <a href=""/sea-of-stars/72039/review/sea-of-stars-review""><u>Sea of Stars</u></a>. That said, it’s worth mentioning that while it’s always very fun, combat is also borderline comically fast a lot of the time, sending you into super-easy fights just as quickly as you’re likely to finish them, with the really interesting encounters reserved for a fairly wide array of inventive bosses. That includes a strange sort of dog monster that creates clones of your party members, as well as a living bow who cleverly disables buttons on your controller to prevent specific types of moves, shaking battles up nicely even if they still don’t usually pose much of a threat. Combat is also definitely the place this remake has been altered most substantially, largely for the better. Button timings now give an even bigger bonus for a super-precise press, even adding a splash damage effect to your basic attacks that made me more thoughtful about how I distributed damage in standard encounters than I ever was in the original. Chaining together well-timed presses also fills up a gauge to use on powerful new Triple Moves, each of which comes with an awesome 3D cutscene. These updates don’t necessarily make the combat feel as modern or as deep as many of the games inspired by the original, but they do help breathe plenty of fresh life into a system that certainly benefits from it. One part of that system that is still a ton of fun is its varied selection of weapons. Rather than only being a statistical increase, the weapons each of your party members use are tailored specifically to them, and their animations – and, as a result, attack timings – change whenever you find a new one. Mario could be kicking a koopa shell or smashing baddies with a hammer, while the totally lovable “tadpole” Mallow can go from swinging a stick to crashing together cymbals. Bowser (who rounds out your party alongside the mysterious Geno and Princess Peach herself) has probably the best weapon option: a glove that lets him pick up and hurl Mario as a projectile like Colossus tossing Wolverine. I loved that each time I switched weapons I had to retrain my muscle memory, which is made easier here by a smart new prompt that guides your timing only until you nail it a few times (and then comes back if you start to slip). The rub of this extremely amusing weapon system, however, is that you don’t have much control over it. This is a very linear game, and each new weapon you find will almost always just be statistically better than the last, with no comparable alternatives to choose from. That’s true of your defensive items too, leaving the RPG part of Super Mario RPG a little bit thin as you don’t really customize your characters much past a single accessory slot for things like small stat boosts or status resistances. Instead, the lifeblood of this campaign is its variety – it’s easy to enjoy some fairly simple combat and progression when you’re never in the same setting long enough to ever come near getting bored. You’ll jump from classic Mario sewers to a ghost-filled sunken pirate ship, from a minigame where you’re barrelling down a waterfall collecting coins to one where you’re running up a hill trying to save Princess Peach, from fighting a crazed bomb person to a living wedding cake. This world could so easily have crumbled into a hodgepodge of disparate ideas, especially when you occasionally remember that this is <i>somehow still a Mario game</i>, but instead they come together to make a strangely coherent and delightfully unique whole. All of the things I mentioned and more have been lovingly recreated with true 3D graphics faithful to the original’s pre-rendered 3D art style, and the new look is… I dunno, it’s fine. I don’t mean to undersell what this remake has done, it really does look quite nice, especially in its brand-new and often super-cool cutscenes – but I can’t help but feel like some amount of the original’s personality has been lost in the translation here. Models and environments are updated almost one-to-one, leaving them looking shiny and new, but removing some of the charm the pre-rendered look naturally had. When I look at other Switch remakes, like <a href=""/legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-switch/29356/review/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review""><u>Link’s Awakening</u></a> or <a href=""/live-a-live-hd/58390/review/live-a-live-review-live-laugh-live""><u>Live A Live</u></a>, I end up wishing this one had found a bit of its own flavor inspired by that SNES look rather than just making the closest approximation it could manage. One area that has been masterfully modernized, however, is the soundtrack. Super Mario RPG’s music has been burned into my brain since childhood, and while the rose-tinted glasses that come with that adoration initially had me thinking the updated versions were just okay, all it took was swapping between new and old (which you can conveniently do at will in the menu) for me to appreciate just how great these new tracks are. They are perfectly reverent while adding impressive layers of instrumentation and nuance to every song, capturing their spirits and all the little accents that make them so catchy while bringing something new to the table in the exact way I wished the graphics had. And speaking of new, this isn’t <i>just </i>the adventure oldies like me might remember. The base campaign has remained relatively untouched in terms of content, but an entirely new post-game lets you explore for secrets you may have missed after the credits roll, while also including some impressive extra challenges to push your limits. Avoiding any specific spoilers, that includes extremely clever twists on some fights that require a deeper use of the combat system and its various mechanics in a way I appreciated. I sort of wish these encounters hadn’t been saved exclusively for an endgame grind, but I like that the added difficulty is there for those left hungry by the main story. There’s also a comprehensive Monster List to fill out, with checkmarks and funny little quotes for every enemy you manage to successfully time Mallow’s Thought Peek ability on, giving me a completionist goal to chase even as combat got overly easy. However, this list exposes perhaps the most surprising issue with Super Mario RPG’s remake: about a third of the way through the campaign, the menus started suffering from serious framerate drops that made everything from shops to equipment juggling to that exhaustive Monster List a chore to navigate. I didn’t run into any technical issues besides this (apart from some similar lag in one specific map area), but it was bad enough that I actively disliked managing my party, checking my items, or revisiting all of those silly quotes I had collected, which is a bit of a bummer. Super Mario RPG is considered a classic for a reason, and this wonderfully faithful remake makes it easy for anyone who missed it in the SNES era to see why. It’s unabashedly odd, reveling in the unexpected with writing that constantly had me bursting out laughing at jokes I’d heard a dozen times before. Its turn-based combat is fairly simple outside of its very clever boss fights, but it’s also ultra satisfying to keep your timing string going even when you’re plowing through pushovers. And while the updated graphics are equal parts pretty and sort of unambitious when it comes to interpreting the original’s style (with some unfortunate menu lag), the new takes on its excellent music are truly exceptional. Super Mario RPG already held up pretty well if you didn’t mind a bit of dust on its different systems, but now there’s no excuse not to see why Mario’s most unexpected adventure is still so beloved. "
Persona 5 Tactica ,8,"Persona 5 Royal is the kind of complete experience that left me wanting for nothing, and so I have some mixed feelings about its spinoff games. And Persona 5 Tactica, which moves the groovy action to a satisfying grid-based combat system, doesn't fully succeed in making me feel the way the original, epic JRPG did. But still, it's nice to get to see some of my favorite characters again. And Atlus' combat designers have shown that their skill at making fast-paced, punchy battles that reward clever planning translates nicely to the turn-based tactics genre. In terms of the timeline, Tactica takes place between the second and third semesters of Persona 5 Royal. And I definitely would not recommend picking it up if you haven't played at least that far into the story. For one, the in-game encyclopedia contains some fairly huge spoilers for Royal. And for another, it doesn't really spend much time introducing you to the characters or the concept of the otherworldly Metaverse. I can only imagine someone coming into this adventure with no previous Persona knowledge would wind up highly confused.   The art style took a little bit of warming up to, as well. The entire cast has been partially chibi-fied, if that's the correct term – though Morgana, hilariously, doesn't really look much different. That threw me off at first, but eventually I more or less stopped noticing. The art direction is definitely very Persona 5, from the menu screens to the mysterious, sprawling Kingdoms that take the place of palaces this time around. Leblanc looks a bit too bright and cheery; I barely recognized it. But all the new friends and foes show off the sort of zany imagination I've come to expect from this universe. And of course, you can't call yourself a Persona 5 game without a hard rocking, energetic, jazzy soundtrack. Composer Toshiki Konishi pulled me back into those immaculate vibes immediately with toe-tapping new tracks for hanging out at the hideout, investigating strange new worlds, and general ass-kicking. Vocalist Lyn Inaizumi is back as well, with some memorable performances, including a new boss fight track. These jams aren't quite on the level of  ""Beneath the Mask"" or ""Rivers in the Desert"" from the main game. But what is, right? Overall, I was impressed with Altus' ability to translate the feel of the Persona combat system to a tactics game as well. Every turn is still about trying to set up combos, but now you'll be darting around the battlefield, taking cover, pushing or luring out enemies, and finishing with a flashy team-up maneuver. It's engaging in a lot of the same ways traditional Persona JRPG battles are, in that you can't get far simply by charging in and focusing your strongest attacks on the first thing you see. Success takes observation, planning, and experimentation. The ability to rewind to your previous turn is very welcome, too. At first, I was afraid it would make things too easy. But each of these missions is pretty short to begin with, rarely taking more than 10 minutes, so even starting all the way over isn't terrible. And being able to change up your plan from the moment you knew it went wrong just cuts back on repeating the same exact moves multiple times, since enemy behavior doesn't seem to have any randomness. Rather than specific enemies having strengths and weaknesses to certain elements, every attack type in Tactica inflicts a status effect that usually has to do with movement. Wind spells push the target a long distance away from the caster. Psy abilities lure the enemy toward you. Gravity can pull a group of enemies toward a specific point. I found lots of interesting ways to use these in combination to set up big combos, since Tactica's version of an all-out attack requires you to basically draw a triangle around multiple enemies with your three party members. But the downside of this approach is that some elements are simply better than others. Fire feels very underpowered, for instance, since it doesn't have a movement effect and you'll never run into an enemy that's weak to it. Sorry, Ann, you're on the bench for this one. I also wish there were more finishers available. Party customization is definitely much simpler than a mainline Persona game, but it's still fairly extensive. The only equipment you can upgrade are guns, with melee damage increasing automatically as your party levels up. But there are well over 100 fusible Personas to unlock and, for the first time, anyone can equip them as a ""sub-Persona,"" not just Joker. So if you want to give Panther a gravity spell… looks like you're back on the varsity squad! Everyone will still be best at a certain thing, though, since they can only upgrade their main element through personalized skill trees. Persona 5 was already a strong front-runner for being the best JRPG ever made, and Royal really gets me wondering what else could even compete. The excellent story and its lovable, multidimensional characters along with the challenging, tactical combat are all refined and back for another round with new surprises and new friends in tow. There are new areas to explore and new twists to leave your jaw on the floor. Very little has been left untouched, and just about everything that has been touched is better off for it. The Phantom Thieves have stolen my heart all over again, and I don’t really want it back. <i>– Leana Hafer, March 31, 2020</i Read the full <a href=""/persona-5-the-royal-ps4/35300/review/persona-5-royal-review"">Persona 5 Royal review</a Joining the familiar cast of Phantom Thieves is Erina, a fiery freedom fighter from this new corner of the Metaverse. The writing for some of the other characters feels a bit stiff, and without social links to give me mechanical rewards for dialogue choices, I <i>really</i> felt how long I spent in overly-wordy conversation scenes. It's way more chatter than would have been needed to tell this story effectively, and a lot of it comes off as meaningless filler. But Erina is a high point, with newcomer Leeanna Albanese bringing depth and determination to the revolutionary leader. The story takes a while to get going, but it eventually builds up to some interesting philosophical questions as it explores a different kind of cognitive world over the course of about 40 hours. If you're familiar with the basics of the Persona series, I don't think it will take you too long to figure out roughly what's going on. But the journey is still worth it, with each of the kingdoms you'll conquer offering a memorably malevolent ruler, a distinct visual style, and varied tactical encounters. I especially liked some of the Fire Emblem-style side quests, which feature one or two characters and must be completed with a set of unique restrictions, like getting across a large map while only taking damage twice.  The boss fights, on the other hand, I found a bit disappointing. While they're normally a highlight of Persona games, putting your skills to the ultimate test in unique ways, the ones in Tactica didn't really make me sweat. It's usually pretty obvious what you need to do to win. Sometimes you're even told the solution outright. And rarely did I feel like I had to put my squad in serious danger to execute that dance. The Shin Megami Tensei franchise is known for its difficulty – that's part of what I like so much about it. But Tactica just isn't on that same level, even if you're going for all of the optional bonus objectives on every map. It's also missing a meaningful resource management angle, since there's no ticking clock on the campaign, you have fewer tough choices about what to do with your hard-earned cash, and you get back all of your SP after each battle. When all is said and done, I had a really good time with Persona 5 Tactica. It's a smaller, easier, less epic experience than its JRPG big brother, but none of that spoils the adventure too much. The combat is quick, clever, and exciting, even if – along with the writing and art style – it seems geared toward younger players or an overall more casual experience. Getting to spend another 40-some hours with my beloved Shujin classmates and bob my head along to some of the best music in video games is well worth my time. Long live the revolution! "
Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 ,9,"It’s nothing short of a miracle that a sequel as well-made as Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 managed to arrive just two years after the original. Developer Fair Play Labs’ second attempt at a Nickelodeon-based platform fighter is a massive leap forward from the first, with a more polished feel, more vibrant characters, and the <i>coup de grace</i>: its envelope-pushing Slime meter. It took me a minute to get comfortable with its slightly buffered movement and wildly expressive Slime mechanics, but after a handful of late nights with friends – both online and off – I couldn’t put it down. While comparisons to the <a href=""/super-smash-bros-for-nintendo-switch/21125/review/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review"">Super Smash Bros.</a> series can cast an obnoxious shadow over this genre, it’s not an exaggeration to say that the only other platform-fighting sequel to improve, rework, and refine what came before it to this impressive degree was the legendary <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/12/03/super-smash-bros-melee"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a> itself. I’ve spent literally thousands of hours in platform fighters like Super Smash Bros. and Rivals of Aether, and  classic Nickelodeon cartoons like <a href=""/spongebob-squarepants-the-cosmic-shake/63710/review/spongebob-squarepants-the-cosmic-shake-review"">Spongebob SquarePants</a> and <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-quest-for-balance-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a> are some of my all-time favorite shows – so I was very disappointed by how much I didn’t like the original All-Star Brawl in 2021. It had the usual platform-fighting structure of damaging up your opponent before knocking them off the screen for a kill, but the animations and sound design were flat, it didn’t seem particularly polished, and most of the characters felt the same. Deeper than that, I found it mechanically unrewarding, with poorly tuned movement that prioritized hollow speed over precision. Instead of weaving a combo together based on my opponent’s damage, the attacks at my disposal, and my position on the stage, I felt more incentivized to string together the same busted attack over and over again until I could spike my poor opponent into the blast zone.  Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl is a very respectable platform fighter that serves as a fun, though far less polished and less fully featured alternative to its competition. The characters and stages feel soulless without the iconic Nickelodeon voice acting and music of its source shows, but All-Star Brawl lands its hits where it matters the most: in the fights themselves. If you can look past its underwhelming audio and visuals to see the surprisingly nuanced fighter just beneath the fog of nostalgia, then you’ll find some real treasure in this pineapple under the sea. - <i>Mitchell Saltzman, Oct 7, 2021</i Read the full <a href=""/nickelodeon-all-star-brawl/50359/review/nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-review"">Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl review</a>. It’s incredible, then, that All-Star Brawl 2 takes nearly every frustration and complaint I had with the first one and inverts them. Combos are deeper and more fleshed out thanks to multiple revamped mechanics, hits feel more substantial and satisfying thanks to beefed up sound design and improved animations, and movement strikes a much better balance between speed and precision. And perhaps most exciting of all, its excellent cast of characters shine thanks to their updated, more cartoony models and well-acted voice lines delivered by many of their original voice actors. Fanservice and nostalgia are often wielded with all the tact of an ill-fated Krabby Patty secret formula attempt – using them as seasoning, rather than the main ingredient, is almost always important. Not so in a crossover fighting game, however. Games like Marvel vs. Capcom and Super Smash Bros. rightly revel in nostalgia, and All-Star Brawl 2 similarly dives straight into the deep end. Every animation and attack for every single character cleverly references something from the original cartoon shows. For example, SpongeBob’s neutral weak aerial is a pose he does during the radical Goofy Goober Rock scene from The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, Ren and Stimpy throw out the iconic Log from their show’s parody commercials, and Aang rides around on his signature ball of air. But these referential movesets aren’t just hollow, with most characters having different gameplans, specialized meters, and other bespoke mechanics that add a fun, necessary level of diversity. SpongeBob, All-Star Brawl 2’s all-around character, is pretty good at everything, but isn’t especially strong at one particular thing more than any other fighter, and he’s a bit floatier in his movement. Compare that to the devastating damage and heavy-hitting combos of Reptar and the difference is clear, with momentum-based movement that feels like controlling a hulking dinosaur should – but that raw power means you won’t have a prayer when you’re trying to get back on the stage. Meanwhile, Garfield has a decent combo game, but doesn’t have many reliable options for killing until his lasagna meter (yes, you read that correctly) gets filled up and he becomes faster and stronger. It’s hard for me to talk about the different ways characters function without going on an overexcited rant about each and every one because they all offer something unique and interesting. Where it took me forever to pick a main in the previous game because I just couldn’t find a character that stood out to me, it’s taken me a long time to find one in All-Star Brawl 2 because I like so much of its cast. After putting every fighter through the motions in the single-player Arcade mode, I found myself excited to explore a whopping half of its 26 characters further. I can’t remember the last time I was this torn and this excited to spend time playing as such a wide swath of different characters in a platform fighter. This is the kind of diverse cast that puts a fighting game into the next stratosphere. Zim is a puppet character now and has the ability to control Gir with greater accuracy, the Angry Beavers work less like Ice Climbers and more like a team from a tag-based 2D fighter with moves that may remind you of some well-known assists from games like Dragon Ball FighterZ, and Plankton is a weird mix between a grappler and a zoner with ranged grabs and wonky projectiles. That cast hasn’t come without sacrifices, though. Not only have a handful of favorites from the previous game been cut, including CatDog and Toph Beifong, but it’s a little weird to see main characters from their own series not show up. Grandma Gertie and Gerald from Hey, Arnold! are playable, for example, but Arnold himself is nowhere to be seen. The same goes for Reptar standing in for any of the Rugrats. While I can understand why that might frustrate some, these choosier omissions leave room for All-Star Brawl 2’s cast to have more diverse playstyles. Reptar is one of the game’s few heavy characters, and both Grandma Gertie and Gerald’s movesets bring a lot of distinct, cool flair to the cast in a way that feels worth the trade-off. While new characters may get the spotlight, even the returning cast brings something fresh and new to the brawl. Fair Play Labs has fully rebuilt every aspect of this sequel, so no character is the same as they were in the previous game. This huge rework may sound like overkill, but it’s a necessary step in making every fighter work with the new Slime mechanic, All-Star Brawl 2’s greatest innovation. I cannot overstate how much style and finesse Slime adds to this game. With just a single button press and a sufficiently filled Slime meter, you can add extra power to any of your special moves, boost your air dodge, cancel out of freefall after using your recovery, boost that recovery further, cancel out of any move’s ending animations, and even escape enemy combos. Versatile, easy to manage, and well-balanced, Slime is an effective tool no matter what character you’re playing or how good you are at All-Star Brawl 2. Slime also grants characters the ability to do a beefy ultimate attack, complete with goofy mini-cutscenes like what you might expect from a Final Smash. Cool as they are, these cutscenes do sometimes pierce the veil of All-Star Brawl 2’s otherwise strong art style. Maybe it’s the PC I’m playing on, but models and animations seem to take a dip in quality during some of these Slime attacks compared to normal gameplay. It’s not present across the board, but Aang’s super, for example, brings his model close enough to cover a good chunk of the screen. At that scale, it has a pixelated, grainy look that comes off especially rough compared to when he’s airbending across the stage. It looks like the models used for fighting are the same ones that appear in these cutscenes, but some of them don’t seem like they were designed to be seen that up-close and personal. Slime’s wide range of uses may sound overwhelming, but this mechanic blends naturally into the ebb and flow of All-Star Brawl 2’s combat, and adds an ocean of depth to the other ways it <i>already</i> improved combat in doing so. Mapped to one specific button, Slime takes the mechanical complexity granted by special meters that you might find in <a href=""/street-fighter-6/67599/review/street-fighter-6-review"">Street Fighter</a> or <a href=""/guilty-gear-2020/46833/review/guilty-gear-strive-review"">Guilty Gear</a>, and combines them with the approachability of Super Smash Bros. Heck, Slime cancels add in a little bit of the nuance that more complicated cancels bring to more traditional fighting games, but you can do them by pressing just one button. The same goes for Ex specials in a game like Street Fighter, but again, with the simpler input system found in platform fighters. This addition and its implementation are ingenious, not only as a means of adding a distinct mechanic not found in other platform fighters, but also as a way of doing so without alienating the party game ethos at the beating heart of this genre. I can confidently hand a controller to my roommate — whose last-played video game was Skyrim — and tell him that he can use Slime to beef up his special attacks confident that he’ll be able to pull it off. It slots so naturally into not just All-Star Brawl 2, but the genre as a whole, that I wouldn’t be surprised to see imitators crop up in the next few years. Lowering the barrier of entry on those more complex techniques while also adding depth makes the impossible suddenly feel possible. I’ve been playing platform fighters since before I could read, and from the moment I became good enough at them to scrape together a basic combo, I’ve always chased those tricky combo options that seem like they should work, but lie tantalizingly just out of reach. In that regard, Slime is my childhood wish fulfilled. The more time I put into All-Star Brawl 2, the more I find myself searching for the next rule I can use it to break. It’s a gripping push-and-pull that I’ve never experienced in a game like this. Slime isn’t the only new addition, though. As if to further tout its illustrious voice cast, All-Star Brawl 2 also has a Campaign mode that features even more voice actors reprising their iconic roles. The story itself isn’t much more than connective tissue written so that our favorite Nicktoons can crossover with one another thanks to Clockwork from Danny Phantom, but it does make for some fun moments. Most of the interactions I’ve found feature characters from SpongeBob encountering each other in the course of a run through this roguelite mode, but there are other surprises too. I think my favorite is an interaction where Clockwork and SpongeBob talk about whether or not Patrick has a brain. It all has the same energy you’d expect from a crossover episode during a Saturday morning cartoon block. This is where All-Star Brawl 2 takes the most direct cues from Smash Bros., incorporating themed battles and events based on the characters and stages available. Each run does a good job of rotating between different game modes to keep you on your toes and prevent even highly experienced platform-fighting fans from floating through its fights. You’ll encounter platforming challenges, fights with teams of minions, and bouts against mind-controlled members of the cast. After completing enough levels, passing through the occasional shop or upgrade area along the way (each with special guests like Hugh Neutron, Powdered Toast Man, or the cabbage vendor from Avatar), you’ll take on a boss fight against an iconic villain like Shredder or The Flying Dutchman. Like most of the other challenges found in its Campaign mode, boss fights aren’t anything too novel compared to what we’ve seen in similar games, but they’re still fun. And the upgrade systems and randomly generated nature of it help to keep things fresher than they would be otherwise. Unfortunately, this is no Hades or Slay The Spire. Running through a series of diverse challenges that put your mastery of different gameplay elements and mechanics to the test makes for a completely serviceable roguelite, but there isn’t much compelling beyond what’s already fun about All-Star Brawl 2 elsewhere. I never felt the gambling sensation that comes from balancing risk against reward in a good roguelike, where making a desperate play to get ahead might just cut a good run short. Nor did I ever get that nagging “one more time” feeling compelling me to pick away at the itchy scab left by a run gone wrong. Other single-player options include an Arcade mode, which uses the same challenge level types found in the Campaign and mashes them up with specially-themed fights, like teaming up with SpongeBob to fight Plankton. It’s a big improvement on the original All-Star Brawl’s much shorter, less curated Arcade Mode – I just wish it had more going on to distinguish it from the very comparable Campaign mode. Surprisingly, the Training mode is far and away the crown jewel of All-Star Brawl 2’s single-player options. This is probably the best training mode I’ve seen implemented in a platform fighter that doesn’t require hacking your Switch, with impressive options I’d usually expect to see in fan-made mods for training modes in other games. That includes hitbox visualization, knockback trajectories, an input display, and even frame data. It’s still years behind the training modes found in traditional fighting games that feature character-specific trials and tutorials, but it’s quite impressive for this genre. Online play is another competitive feather in All-Star Brawl 2’s cap. I haven’t been able to find any ranked matches during the pre-release review period, but online lobbies with both friends and strangers work really well thanks to its buttery-smooth rollback netcode; a must for any contemporary fighting game. I had a few problems when playing online with friends who weren’t updated to the same game version as me, and while it boggles my mind that there weren’t fail-safes for that kind of thing, it was the only issue I ran into with online play. After patching and hopping back into the fray, the gap from Chicago to Los Angeles suddenly closed and it felt so smooth that my friend might as well have been on the couch next to me. Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 finally lives up to its name, standing as an all-star platform fighter. Not only is it a fantastic sequel that takes criticisms of the first game to heart and sends them to the blast zone, it expands way beyond those adjustments. Decent (if samey) single-player options with a good amount of challenge, a training mode clearly made by people who know exactly how to construct a platform-fighting laboratory on a level rarely seen, and stellar rollback netplay bolster a supremely fun fighting system. The excellent new Slime mechanic then elevates it to a new level by introducing a huge amount of creativity to every character in its impressive roster without making it unapproachable for the party game audience. Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 belongs among the greats of the platform fighting genre – and the moment I’m done writing this, I’m going back for more. "
oboCop: Rogue City ,7,"Paul Verhoeven’s RoboCop is one of the quintessential action movies of the 1980s. It pushed the envelope with over-the-top violence, killer one-liners, and fantastic special effects, mixed with a biting anti-corporate social commentary under the surface that resonated with audiences. There have been multiple attempts to resurrect the series over the years, including an <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/05/robocop-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">ill-fated reboot in 2014</a>, but nothing has captured the ephemeral “it” that struck a chord when the series debuted. That’s what is most impressive about RoboCop: Rogue City: it’s not just a solid first-person shooter set in the RoboCop universe – developer Teyon absolutely nails the look and feel of its film inspiration in ways that nothing else has. It’s a good game, and the most authentic adaptation the series has ever seen.   The story itself is nothing groundbreaking: a bad guy who looks like he is fated to be thrown off the top of Naktatomi Plaza in Die Hard is up to no good, and you need to stop him. OCP is still an evil corporation, and drug-fueled gangs rule the streets. If you’ve ever seen an old-school action movie set in a city you’ll know what to expect. RoboCop himself is also treading familiar ground, with what remains of Officer Alex Murphy still struggling with figuring out the line between man and machine within himself, this time with the help of a therapist. That’s the most compelling thematic thread, and it felt like it could’ve been interesting to explore. Unfortunately, it exists exclusively in dialogue options and cutscenes, with no ramifications in gameplay. That’s too bad, as it relegates us to being an observer in his introspective crises, rather than sharing in it.  It also makes some degree of sense in that Rogue City is primarily a first-person shooter about blowing through hordes of criminal scum, but it is also smart about focusing on what makes the titular character unique. Robo (as his friends call him) is a walking tank. The slow, plodding bounce of his gate, with a heavy thunk accompanying each footfall, makes him feel like a juggernaut. The street gangs, bikers, and mercenaries that make up the bulk of the enemy fodder aren’t anywhere close to as powerful as he is, and it is so fun to walk right at these evil doers, shrugging off their small arms fire, and shredding them to literal pieces with the <i>brap brap </i>of Robo’s iconic Auto 9 machine-pistol. It’s exceptionally violent, as it should be. Arms and heads explode like pressurized watermelons, bodies tumble and ragdoll all around, and enemies scream about lost limbs. There are often a lot of enemies on screen at once, and turning them into a shower of crimson is a frequent and entertaining occurrence. It may not be appropriate for all ages, but it’s true to the R-rated source material, and here it is ratcheted up to a degree that is humorous and over the top rather than gratuitous and excessive. There’s a decent variety of enemies, including some that can make more than a dent in Robo, like snipers, heavy troops, and infamous big boy ED-209, and those present opportunities to get more strategic with your approach than simply charging in and busting heads. You can pick up and use guns dropped by enemies, like shotguns and assault rifles, though their ammo is limited (while Auto 9’s is not). You can also grab and throw a lot of things, like explosive barrels, motorcycles, and unlucky henchmen, which is as hilarious as it is effective.  The wonderfully destructible environment plays a key role in the combat design, too. Sometimes it’s purely aesthetic, as monitors explode, papers scatter, and shattered cement rains down from damaged structures. Other times it’s strategic, as you blast apart the cover your foes are trying to hide behind. The most exciting is the breach opportunities, pre-designated spots where Robo smashes through doors or compromised walls and takes the bad guys by surprise, offering you a few seconds of slow motion to take out enemies before they can return fire or shoot their hostages. This translation of a nearly 40-year-old action movie into a game is so detailed and strictly loyal to the films that it almost resembles something fan-made – and I mean that in the best way. There’s very little artistic license taken, favoring nearly 1:1 translations from the source material across the board. RoboCop looks and sounds like his original self, complete with Peter Weller’s piercing gaze under his helmet, and voice reprising his best-known role. Officer Anne Lewis is there as RoboCop’s partner and confidant, and looks exactly like actress Nancy Allen portrayed her. Whether it's the Detroit West precinct office, the OCP corporate office, or the mean streets of dystopian Detroit, Rogue City nails the look and feel of the movies to an impressive degree. The entire ‘80s-ness of the presentation is brilliant. The heavy use of synth in the soundtrack fits it to a tee. The dark grimy streets and mohawk-sporting gangs that were central fictional goons throughout the decade are present in force. There are CRT monitors in all the cubices, a green wireframe HUD, and police cruisers that look an <i>awful </i>lot like the old Ford Tauruses that were used in the movies. Small touches, like the visible scan lines when you zoom in and aim down your weapon sights (which also highlights enemies so you can pick them off through smoke and darkness), is exactly the right vibe. Similarly, there’s no modernization of the original’s satirical critique of police brutality – and arguably, none is needed. The appeal to nostalgia is strong, and that can have a significant impact on how much mileage you get out of this. As a pure shooter, Rogue City isn’t overly ambitious, but it’s a lot of fun to play even if you don’t know anything about the series. However, if you grew up with RoboCop or recently watched the movies then it is chock-full of references and nods that add a lot to the experience. I found myself laughing out loud the first time I saw someone driving a 6000 SUX out in the wild. Exploding the groin of a baddie is a silly bit of over-the-top violence on its surface, but it’s so much more entertaining if you know that it’s pulled directly from the film.  At the same time, this isn’t the most technically impressive game when held up next to the flashy big-budget adventures we’re regularly treated to these days. Textures are kind of flat and lighting effects are minimalistic, plus a lot of the gang members’ voices are extremely similar to one another, but there’s something B-movie quality that makes it more forgivable, if not a bit charming. Still, another coat of polish would have gone a long way, especially in cutscenes where all of those issues are more apparent in close-ups. More than once I had audio and video get out of sync, had frozen faces accompany dialogue, and had total game crashes on two occasions. Levels alternate between very linear A-to-B stages in which you charge through enemies looking for the “New Guy” in Town who’s taken over the Nuke business in the aftermath of RoboCop 2, and self-contained sandbox areas that put the “cop” in RoboCop. As you walk around the mean streets of Detroit you’ll come across side missions focused on Robo’s prime directives of Serve the Public Trust, Protect the Innocent, and Uphold the Law. Some are simple, such as having you issue fines for small infractions. It sounds kind of silly, but it’s a fun bit of roleplaying to see an oversized truck parked on the curb leaking oil and slap a ticket on the windshield. One memorable scene had me manning a podium at the police office, listening to a litany of citizen complaints. The image of Robo standing there while a wanted criminal tries to turn himself in for the reward money makes me laugh every time I think about it. Other side missions are more expansive and are the sort of contained side stories that feel worth playing on their own merits. One subplot spanning multiple quests has you helping to reform a drug addict turned informant. Seemingly mundane things like helping him return a watch he stole, or picking out a VHS tape from a video store, are poignant palette-cleansers from the brutal action sequences, though there are certainly a few good shootouts along the way.  Completing all the side quests and main story took me just over 17 hours, a pretty solid runtime for a single-player-only campaign. A simple leveling system does a good job of offering a basic sense of progression as you go, feeding skill points into things like increasing damage resistance or extending the slow motion timeframes, as well as some non-combat skills that open up new dialogue options or allow you to open safes. Every few upgrades spent on a particular skill add a perk, like a rapid dash maneuver, or armor that reflects small arms fire back at enemies. Finding bits of evidence scattered around, reading notes, and completing bonus objectives are good sources of XP, giving a nice incentive to go off the beaten path in the open areas. RoboCop: Rogue City is a pitch-perfect throwback to the action movies of the ‘80s. It’s over-the-top violence with charm, largely well put together but rough on the edges. Most importantly, it's a fun way to spend time in a beloved fictional universe that doesn’t overstay its welcome. Blasting at goons as an unstoppable walking machine remains as extremely entertaining as it seemed on the big screen, thanks in part to an impressive commitment to capturing the look and feel of the original film. Mixing in elements like routine police work and side quests does a great job changing the pace, too. Even if it’s not the best example of visual fidelity, and prone to some bugs along the way, that love of RoboCop shines through. This is a solid B movie of a video game, which is exactly what the source material demands. "
The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria ,4,"The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria might lovingly depict one of the most recognizable fantasy worlds ever created, but to my surprise, that’s not actually the most recognizable thing about it. This is a survival game first and a Lord of the Rings game second, content to replicate all the familiar mechanics of the genre while leaning heavily on its Tolkien backdrop to compensate for a lack of original ideas. If you’ve played any survival game in the last 15 years, you’ll immediately know what you’re in for as you build bases, cook food, upgrade your pickaxes to mine better ores, craft armor and weapons to fight hordes of enemies, and run back home when it gets dark. The trouble is there’s no part of the tried-and-true survival blueprint that Return to Moria does better than games that came before it, and there are some parts, like the terrible combat and constraining building, that are significantly worse than most.   Return to Moria’s story takes place during Middle-earth’s Fourth Age, after the fall of Sauron and the conclusion of the War of the Ring – an interesting choice, since this era has not been explored much at all in the canon. Everyone’s favorite dwarf and occasional projectile, Gimli (who is once again voiced by movie trilogy actor John Rhys-Davies), has called all the dwarf factions back to Moria in order to reclaim it from the goblins and orcs who have taken over. As one of those summoned dwarves, you and up to seven friends are sent into the menacing bowels of the lost kingdom to cook rat meat, decorate hastily assembled hovels, and juggle dozens of materials between haphazardly placed chests like the unrepentant hoarders you are. After an opening cutscene that throws you into a dark hole, the story slowly builds to a confrontation with a powerful entity that’s corrupted Moria with dark magic. That said, most of that story is little more than a series of excuses to reference the events of Fellowship of the Ring, like when you find the stone Pippin threw down the well or walk through the room where Frodo’s Mithril saved him from an otherwise-fatal blow; just about every other room finds a way to remind you that the Fellowship traveled through here. It’s not that the story is bad overall, and I can forgive a certain amount of fan service in a Lord of the Rings game, but the larger issue with it is that you spend about 95% of the journey, which took me nearly 45 hours to complete, jogging through dark corridors and beating up irritating goblins, so it’s easy to forget there’s any kind of plot to follow to begin with. Occasionally, though, it reminds you you’re in Middle-earth in endearing ways – namely through song. If you’ve ever read a Tolkien book then you know the man could only go a few pages before he felt the insurmountable urge to lay down a beat, and I love how much Return to Moria pays tribute to that legacy. While mining all manner of ore, your dwarf will start singing from a wide library of light-hearted songs. If you get drunk with your comrades, you’ll all start dancing and singing some epic ballad about your people’s history. And during key story moments, you’ll break out some especially stirring songs filled with lore and a whole lot of heart. That is, if you aren’t interrupted by a sudden emergence of goblins and orcs trying to kill you in the middle of your musical number, as I was a number of times. The main thing Return to Moria gets right is the almost rhythmic pattern of gathering more and better resources to feed your growing base-building needs. That loop of exploring deeper and deeper into a dangerous mine filled with monsters as you collect resources and improve your character can be entertaining. While at first you can get by with a dusty pickaxe and sword, you’ll quickly find yourself outmatched by enemies further down in the darkness, and therein lies the fun. You’ll need to acquire rarer raw materials, upgrade your gear, and improve the accommodations at your base to make the going easier, like a very necessary keg filled with beer to maintain morale. It’s easy to get lost in the continuous grind as you aim for the latest shiny thing that’s going to enable you to brave the next leg of the journey. This loop will be very familiar to anyone who’s stayed up too late running around in Minecraft or slaying giant spiders in Grounded, so we’re not exploring new territory here, but it’s extremely important that Return to Moria at least retreads that ground well. Unfortunately, the actual building, combat, and especially exploration that come along with that generally enjoyable grind all miss the mark, and all for the same reason: a shocking absence of freedom. While you can set up a base from scratch almost anywhere, each new zone has at least one or two preset campsites that are extremely beneficial to use as starting points, making it very difficult to justify dumping a bunch of resources into making camp anywhere else. And even when I did decide to go rogue and settle down in a place of my choosing, most of the time the building options were so frustratingly finicky it made me regret the undertaking. In one case I spent half an hour trying to build a second story for my base that kept collapsing due to some unspecific rules regarding load-bearing structures, and in another I immediately realized the area I’d chosen was diagonally oriented on Return to Moria’s grid-based map, meaning every single structure I placed was chaotically incompatible with the layout of the room. It really feels like the designers did everything they could think of to prevent you from creating your own settlements, which is certainly a strange set of priorities for an adventure that’s literally all about rebuilding Moria. Even worse is combat, which is a very dull pattern of blocking, stabbing, or shooting arrows with only a few weapon types that feel far too similar, which is a major ball to drop since Return to Moria has you doing a whole heck of a lot of it. Goblins, orcs, and uruks spawn all over the map whenever you’re not looking, raise an army against you whenever your mining and exploration create too much noise, and assault your bases with intent to destroy them on a regular basis. Many of these encounters can last 15 to 20 minutes, as dozens and dozens of identical cretins surround you and continuously respawn for a painful amount of time. Fighting is largely not difficult, since the enemy AI is some of the most facepalmingly incompetent I’ve ever seen, but with large health bars and regular incoming attacks that had me dodging and blocking more than I had the opportunity to attack, it drags on for far too long.  And when I say enemy AI is bad, I really can’t understate it. Enemies constantly get stuck on top of and inside their surroundings, allow you to stand at a safe distance and pick them off with ranged attacks, and repeat the same attacks over and over again, letting you spam the same response a dozen times before they finally go down for the count. Every once in a while you get a new enemy type like a drake or a troll to contend with, but even these fall victim to terrible AI, quickly casting any excitement straight into the fires of Mount Doom. Also, I also feel the need to mention just how annoying the enemies are. They never stop screaming like maniacs and, even if you’re not in their immediate vicinity, you can hear them hooting and hollering nonstop. After more than 40 hours of that, I felt like letting out a psychotic scream of my own.  Return to Moria also makes the perplexing choice of not actually letting you mine in any direction you want, instead putting up hard, impenetrable barriers wherever you go, and only allowing you to dig through laughably small hallways that connect one area to another. No Man’s Sky and Ark have longevity because there’s no end to the ways you can make the world your own, build creative and interesting bases, and express yourself. Return to Moria has bafflingly little of that. Even mining is limited to small deposits found on the sides of the mine’s halls, providing a shallow deposit to be carved out before hitting another impenetrable barrier. It’s just wild to play as a dwarf in a mine without being able to actually dig through… basically anything. On the bright side, all the areas you encounter along the way have a lot of personality to them, from the Elven Quarter filled with trees and beauty, to some gross depths covered in glowing mushrooms and clouds of poisonous corruption. Highlighting one of the only ways Return to Moria differentiates itself from its peers, traveling through this underground kingdom’s linear path feels like a proper Lord of the Rings adventure. Even if very little of it stands out as particularly impressive, I still enjoyed the gratifying process of building up my base in an area, improving my gear, then packing my things and journeying deeper underground to see if I can survive what’s next. That does make the journey a bit more linear than your typical survival game, but in the tradition of Tolkien adventures that lead the heroes on a harrowing adventure from one part of Middle-earth to another, it just feels right. One of the areas Return to Moria falls shortest is in its consistently poor performance, from bugs like items disappearing, to issues like unstable framerates and abnormally long loading times. There are even extreme cases like how some areas fail to load before you get there, exposing developer objects like immersion-ruining walls separating two parts of the map that don’t disappear until you’ve gotten entirely too close to them. In fact, there are only a few cases where Return to Moria ever looks or performs well at all, and it seems to get worse when more players are added to a world, especially for the guests (since I usually played in my host world, my friends experienced even worse performance than I did). Performance aside though, Return to Moria is most definitely best when enjoyed among friends, as no Lord of the Rings tale is complete without a party of friends to share the adventure with. It might make things significantly more chaotic to have four or five friends in your world all breaking stuff and smacking around wolves, plus the need to feed all those mouths and craft enough gear to go around can add to the grind, but it’s very nice to even the odds in large combat encounters that go by much quicker with a group. Plus, it’s always handy to have someone to revive you or help you carry all the loot you don’t have room for in your backpack. But again, this is a case of the more, the buggier. As a big fan of both The Lord of the Rings and survival games, I was enticed by the idea that I can dive into a genre I already know and love with the rich lore of Middle-earth to keep me company (as well as a party of friends), but it’s disappointing to see such a promising concept do little more than a barely passable impression of better games. Combat is dull and repetitive, owing to overused enemy types and braindead AI, and limited mining opportunities or freedom with settlement building throws a wet blanket over the creativity that’s typically a selling point for the genre. Throw in rough technical performance and it becomes difficult to recommend Return to Moria to even my fellow Tolkien stans. There’s a decent game in here somewhere, as the compelling progression loop and chaotic multiplayer capabilities can make for a really good time – I just can’t give you many reasons to pick this survival game over the plethora of better options when it’s only ever by-the-numbers at best.

Alan Wake II ,9,"Thirteen years after his wife went missing in the small town of Bright Falls, author Alan Wake is trapped inside a Dark Place that he can’t seem to write himself out of. As I sit down to type out this review of Alan Wake II, I can somewhat empathize. This is just so incomparable to anything else I’ve played in recent memory that it’s tough to work out exactly where to start. Alan Wake II is a single-player adventure that seamlessly shifts from slow-burn psychological terror to frantic survival-horror action, from gorgeously rendered game worlds to striking full-motion video sequences, and from morbid investigations to show-stopping musical surprises. It’s bloody, it's bonkers, and for the most part it's utterly brilliant. Coming in at the tail end of a bumper-crop gaming year packed with absolute bangers, Alan Wake II still manages to burn as brightly as a freshly fired signal flare. Spanning two wildly contrasting realities, Alan Wake II’s roughly 17-hour story manages to be far more coherent than that of the original – despite its substantial increase in complexity. We pick things up in present day Bright Falls, taking control of FBI Agent Saga Anderson, who’s been dispatched to the small lakeside town to investigate the latest victim in a series of ritualistic slaughters: a body found beside Cauldron Lake with a gaping hole where his heart used to be. Saga is an instantly likable addition to the weird world that Alan Wake shares with Remedy Entertainment’s other supernatural game, <a href=""/control"">Control</a>. She’s dedicated to her casework but not above a bit of playful banter with her partner, Special Agent Alex Casey, and these opening couple of hours of mostly combat-free procedural investigation give the story a realistic grounding before the darkness starts to descend and every placid hillscape transforms into a harrowing hellscape.  Part of the reason Alan Wake II’s main serial killer mystery and its numerous subplots are so easy to keep track of is due to the caseboard found in Saga’s metaphysical ‘mind place’, which can be accessed at any moment with the tap of a button. Each new piece of evidence, character profile, or foreshadowing manuscript page found in Bright Falls and its surroundings must be manually arranged onto a branching tree of red string and palm cards pinned to the wall, corralling it all into order and keeping you focused on the case. I’m not ashamed to say that I couldn’t get through a season of <a href=""/true-detective"">True Detective</a> (at least, one of the good ones) without having one eye on my television and the other on a Reddit thread open on my phone, so I loved having this in-built method of keeping the facts straight. As Saga’s investigation progresses in the early moments of Alan Wake II’s story, each discovery raises more unsettling questions than it answers: Why do so many of the locals behave as though they’ve known Saga for years? Why is the janitor character from <a href=""/control"">Control</a> performing karaoke in a local town hall? And why did that corpse suddenly haul his naked arse out of the morgue and into the woods? Although its difficulty level can be adjusted to three different settings, Alan Wake II’s mood is always set to <i>uneasy </i>mode. The mystery deepens still when Alan Wake washes up onto the shore of Cauldron Lake, rambling about the Dark Place and surprised to learn that he’s been missing for the past 13 years. Then Alan Wake II <i>really </i>gets weird. From here, the perspective shifts back and forth between Saga’s search for the truth in Bright Falls and Alan’s desperate attempts to escape his doomed Dark Place dimension, with both sides gradually bleeding into each other in increasingly unpredictable and discombobulating ways – to the point that I could barely discern fact from fiction (within fiction) before eventually resolving into a supremely well-executed gut-punch of an ending that neatly ties off the bulk of the story threads while tantalizingly leaving a handful of loose ones to dangle. Remedy, if you make us wait another 13 years to tie these up (and start more) that will be much less endearing. iframe allow=""autoplay; fullscreen *"" allowautoplay="""" allowfullscreen=""true"" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/alan-wake-ii/74599/gallery/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery74599"" scrolling=""no""></iframe The alluring power of its contrasting settings only further enhances its mystery, but while the lakeside shores of Bright Falls present some stunning sunset scenes and detail-rich forest surrounds, it’s the grimy, neon-soaked New York plaza setting of Alan’s stages that really show off the immense skill of Remedy’s team of artists. Resembling the kind of nightmare you might have after spending 24 hours eating cheese and watching <a href=""/taxi-driver-1976"">Taxi Driver</a> and <a href=""https://www.ign.com/movies/mean-streets"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mean Streets</a> on a loop, this rotten slice of the Big Apple is a haunting otherworld that I found consistently compelling to explore, from the graffiti-covered construction areas to the menacing sprawl of subway tunnels that lie beneath its surface. Alan’s stages also stimulated a different part of my brain by introducing some enjoyable environmental puzzles. Using a paranormal table lamp, Alan can absorb the energy from one light source and redirect it to another in order to both create a new illuminated safe haven from the evils that lurk in the shadows – but also to physically alter the world around him and open up new paths forward. It’s a dazzling trick that recalls the pulling of the light switch cord to blink in and out of the Oceanview Hotel from the Oldest House in <a href=""/control"">Control</a>, and it grows in complexity over time: determining the right sequence to manipulate multiple light sources progressively ups the challenge involved in unlocking each new area to examine. In place of gathering evidence and arranging it on a caseboard like in Saga’s stages, in Alan’s reality you must seek out plot elements in the form of floating pairs of orbs that must be observed from the right perspective to create an eclipse that triggers ghostly, hardboiled scenes from Alan’s own Alex Casey crime novel series. These can then be rewritten into Alan’s present scenario to distort his reality into disturbing new dioramas that bring him closer towards the dark place’s exit, and reveal ominous parallels to the Bright Falls slayings that Saga seeks to solve. (And here I was thinking Michael Cera was the only Alan desperate to escape a corrupted alternate reality this year.) To make things all the more disconcerting, Alan Wake II’s Creative Director, Sam Lake, plays both the character of Alex Casey in Alan’s world <i>and</i> FBI Special Agent Alex Casey in Saga’s story, and also appears as himself in a peculiar late night talk show that Alan finds himself as a recurring guest on. You might not know his name but you probably know his famous face, since it was plastered on the mug of the original <a href=""/max-payne"">Max Payne</a>. He even does the signature scowl! Alan Wake II’s heavy meta-mystery is like a jigsaw puzzle locked inside a Rubik’s Cube that’s covered in sudokus, and it’s honestly such a strange and wonderful trip that takes more unexpected detours and recursive loops than a disgruntled Uber driver. Indeed Alan Wake II features more plots than a cemetery, and just as high a bodycount. The fundamentals of combat remain largely the same as the enjoyable flashlight-fueled fighting of the original, but its execution has been enhanced significantly. Enemies are once again literal shadows of their former selves, and the most efficient way to dispatch them is by using the boosted beam of your flashlight to burn away their cloudy darkness shields and blasting disgusting chunks of exposed flesh off their bones with your expanding arsenal of firearms. This time around glowing weak points will occasionally be revealed on an enemies’ body, and if you manage to successfully target them you can inflict substantially more damage and save a few precious ammo rounds in the process, which felt like a nice reward for taking an extra fraction of a second to carefully line up my shots. This won’t be a big deal to anybody used to games that allow you to run, but if you’re coming back to Alan Wake along with me it is fantastic: Both Saga and Alan are blessed with an unlimited sprint ability, which marks a huge improvement to the perennially out-of-puff Alan from the original, who couldn’t run 10 yards without doubling over like an asthmatic who just took a wrong turn into a smokers lounge. Our protagonists are generally more nimble, too; the dodge button feels snappier and allowed me to more reliably duck under swinging pipes or thrown pickaxes, and it even works on the ground should you be knocked off your feet, allowing you to quickly roll out of harm’s way and avoid any potential follow-up attacks.  But challenge is part of the charm of the original, and Remedy has not forgotten that. Saga and Alan may be more fleet-footed in Alan Wake II, but ammunition and batteries remain scarce. And although it doesn’t quite rival <a href=""/resident-evil-4-remake"">Resident Evil 4</a> in terms of enemy variety, there are enough different gloomy goons to be surprised by that I could never really anticipate which breed of shadow warrior was waiting to ambush me down any given path. From hulking brutes with sledgehammers to darting wolves and freakish, multi-limbed mirror monsters that I can’t quite accurately describe, Alan Wake II consistently shuffled its deck to keep my head on a swivel and my thumb nervously twitching over the quick select weapon menu. Some enemies even throw darkness projectiles that home in on you and must either be dodged or carefully caught with your flashlight’s beam like a fighter jet’s countermeasures. I haven’t seen this much shade thrown since the last Eminem diss track. There are some wonderfully frantic and distinct boss fights too, including a dimly lit, close-quarters scrap with a rampaging reanimated corpse who was hellbent on caving my chest in with the sharp end of a torn-off tree branch, and another later on that had me desperately burning away an arena full of darkness blobs while trying to avoid having my head separated from my shoulders by an enemy’s rifle shots from afar. Yet oddly enough, I found that the enemy in Alan Wake II that I feared the most was the one that more often than not couldn’t even hurt me. Alan’s reality is littered with whispering apparitions, but nine times out of 10 they dissipate into wisps of smoke if you train your flashlight on them. It’s that tenth instance you need to worry about, though, because it’s likely to be an actual physical nasty waiting to ambush you from plain sight after you’ve been lulled into a false sense of security. As a result, I started second-guessing each and every human-shaped shadow – including my own – which felt perfectly in sync with Alan’s own unraveling mental state. Alan’s mental health isn’t the only thing here that isn’t as strong as it could be. Although the different arsenals of the two playable characters each boast their own advantages, from the heightened stopping power and reusable bolts of Saga’s crossbow to the expanded area-of-effect of Alan’s flare gun, their individual skill trees seem somewhat lopsided in their implementation. Whereas Alan’s ‘Words of Power’ skill tree features 21 different skills that can each be potentially upgraded up to three times over, Saga’s upgrades are limited to just three buffs for each firearm in her inventory, and each comes at such a high cost of the collectable manuscript scraps hidden around Bright Falls that by the time I’d reached the end credits I’d only invested in a handful of them. To be frank, they didn’t feel all that necessary on the normal difficulty setting, but perhaps they’ll be of far greater use in the planned Nightmare difficulty that’s set to be added to Alan Wake II post-launch. Furthermore, and in contrast with Alan’s impressive environmental remixing, Saga is regularly saddled with a few too many survival-horror stereotypes, like fuse boxes to repair and combination locks to solve (although to be fair, decoding the latter does require a significant amount of brain power at times). I was also a little bit disappointed that there were no new Night Springs episodes to watch on the televisions in Bright Falls, although having said that, the commercials that are substituted in their place (starring a pair of local entrepreneurs called the Koskela brothers) were so hilariously offbeat that I still tried to track down every in-game idiot box I could find. (I’m talking about fictional commercials, that is, not poorly implemented product-placement for Verizon Wireless.) Still, any issues I had with Alan Wake II sank without a trace like an out-of-towner in Cauldron Lake, washed away by the torrent of other things that it gets right. It undoubtedly takes a lot of inspiration from film and television, taking the <a href=""/twin-peaks-1"">Twin Peaks</a>-meets-<a href=""/the-twilight-zone-1959"">The Twilight Zone</a> base of the original and mixing in the best bits of <a href=""/true-detective"">True Detective</a>, <a href=""/seven-theater"">Seven</a>, <a href=""/inception"">Inception</a>, and more into the pot. But it also folds in some nods to some modern gaming classics, blindsiding you with truly unnerving, <a href=""/inscryption"">Inscryption</a>-like fourth-wall trickery and eerie full-motion video moments that recall 2022’s found-footage freak out, <a href=""/immortality"">Immortality</a>. In one truly astonishing early game moment that I don’t want to completely spoil here, it even briefly becomes an interactive musical; as though the team at Remedy took one look at the ‘Jump Up, Super Star!’ level from <a href=""/super-mario-for-nintendo-switch"">Super Mario Odyssey</a> and decided to appropriate it in the most bombastically bizarre way possible. For a glorious 20 minutes or so, Alan Wake II resembles something less like a survival-horror video game and more like a <a href=""/the-rocky-horror-picture-show"">Rocky Horror Picture Show</a>, and it had me grinning like a maniac from the ring of the first riff to the final blazing guitar solo. Although Alan Wake II has no shortage of out-of-your-seat scares, it’s moments like these that prove Remedy has approached the actual design of its long-awaited sequel completely without fear. Alan Wake II delivers one of the boldest and most brain-bending survival-horror storylines this side of Silent Hill 2, presents it with uniformly immaculate art direction and audio design, and reinvigorates the series’ signature light-based shooting as though it’s been locked and loaded with a fresh pack of Energizers. Even though its skill-upgrade systems seem a little superfluous and there were a few repeated cliches in Saga’s story that stuck in my craw, I nonetheless found both sides of this twisted tale to be endlessly fascinating, frequently fear-inducing, and consistently surprising. Alan Wake II is a superb survival-horror sequel that makes the cult-classic original seem like little more than a rough first draft by comparison. "
Ghostrunner 2 ,9,"The best sequels are the ones that can recapture what made the original so great, while also expanding those elements to make them feel bigger, grander, and more exciting than what came before. That’s exactly what Ghostrunner 2 manages to pull off. This is still a first person, one-hit-kill slasher where – to quote my review of the first one – you must run fast, slide fast, kill fast, and if you can’t do those things fast enough, you die fast. But now you get to do all of that while also occasionally riding an absolutely sick motorcycle, and with a wider variety ninja tricks to customize your playstyle. Couple that with a much more fleshed out world, excellent level variety, fantastic bosses, and a thumping soundtrack that enhances the action, and you’ve got one of the most exciting action games all year. Ghostrunner 2 picks up shortly after the events of the first game, which are recapped in a handy dandy video. Story is a much bigger focus this time around, with most levels being preceded by a visit to a hub where you can chat with your fellow rebels. You’ll learn about their mostly interesting backstories, as well as the post apocalyptic cyberpunk dystopia that is Dharma City, with conversations that were always interesting enough to make me want to check in with everyone before my next mission. There’s Zoe, your friend from the original that helped you find your humanity; Saul, the kind hearted doctor who fixes you up; Kira, a brilliant but morally questionable scientist that used to work for the other side; along with another surprise face or two. It’s not RPG levels of characterization and world building, but these interactions did a great job of grounding me in Ghostrunner 2’s world.  Fundamentally, Ghostrunner 2 plays very much like the first – It’s one hit, one kill for both you and your enemies, which makes for a lightning fast flow. You’ll be darting all across very carefully crafted combat arenas as you desperately try to avoid fire and close the distance between you and your opposition at the same time. If you die, respawns are super quick and checkpoints are very forgiving, which meant I could die 10, 20, maybe even 50 times trying to beat a tricky combat encounter without feeling any frustration. Basically, imagine Hotline Miami or Katana Zero, but in a 3D space, and with all sorts of mobility options that let you dodge bullets and outmaneuver foes with ease. While that core is still the same in Ghostrunner 2, there are several notable changes that affected how I approached its challenges. For one, there’s now a stamina meter that governs your newfound ability to block attacks and dash multiple times in succession. Blocking may sound exceptionally strong in a game where all it takes is one hit to die, but evading enemies is still the way to go when it comes to surviving the chaos that is Ghostrunner’s combat encounters because of how quickly the meter depletes, the many unblockable attacks that enemies use, and the fact that blocking certain attacks will still send you reeling backwards. Still, being able to just block as opposed to having to perfectly time a parry offers some nice leeway that makes many boss encounters much more forgiving, and fun. More substantial are your new special abilities. Shurikens return, but are now available on demand as opposed to being a limited time powerup, which gives you a powerful, but meter managed, ranged attack to go along with your trusty katana. It’s especially fun to use on big enemies like the bipedal mechs, as a hit with a shuriken turns them into a grapple point, which allows you to quickly, and satisfyingly, go in for the kill while also staying on the move. The Ghostrunner gets a few other brand new special abilities and ultimate techniques added to his arsenal as well, such as the Shadow skill, which allows you to turn invisible and create a double at the spot where you activated it, and Flux, which allows you to shoot out a continuous laser beam for a few seconds to decimate groups of foes.  Thankfully, you no longer have to arrange blocks like a puzzle to upgrade these abilities. Skill progression is much more straightforward, with you unlocking a variety of upgrade chips naturally just by playing through the campaign. You can purchase whatever chips you want, but in order to equip them to your motherboard, you’ll have to add slots by finding purple memory chips hidden in each level. This adds a nice incentive to really explore for the secrets of every stage beyond just unlocking superficial collectibles, like new sword skins, glove colors, etc. I always looked forward to coming back to the base and seeing what new skill chips were available, because they really do a great job of giving noticeable perks that could dramatically change my approach to a level. I could invest in Shurikens and give myself more of an edge from a distance, or I could invest in my sword skills and get rewarded more heavily for executing perfect parries. Or,r if I feel especially confident, I could invest in flow and gain powerful buffs, but only if I’m able to string kills together without letting the combo counter drop. One of the best qualities of the first Ghostrunner was how just about every level introduced some sort of new element for you to deal with, making the campaign feel fresh all the way through. Apparently that well of ideas never came close to running dry because the same is true for Ghostrunner 2. Throughout the entirety of its 10-12 hour campaign, you’re constantly encountering new enemy types, gaining new powers or abilities, visiting a variety of gorgeous and visually distinct areas both in and outside of Dharma City, and getting thrown into arenas that give you exciting new ways to use your existing powers. The different styles of gameplay can basically be broken down into: Combat arenas, parkour challenges, and motorcycle segments, but there’s a truly impressive amount of variation within each of those styles. Because of the one-hit kill nature, combat often becomes a puzzle where you have to figure out which way to approach from, what enemies you should target first, which of them can be easily taken out with environmental hazards, and so on. Every encounter is an incredibly satisfying combination of planning, execution, and on the fly improvisation. On the parkour side, it’s a lot of what existing fans are probably used to: Lengthy stretches of wallrunning, railgrinding, grapple hooking, and pole swinging. But in Ghostrunner 2, it’s everything in between those actions that makes it special. Sometimes you’ll need to use a shuriken to power up a device, and then quickly move onto it before certain death; other times you’ll need to use your shadow ability at just the right time to interrupt a beam of light that causes a life saving swinging pole to emerge; and in my absolute favorite section, you’ll need to swap between making two different colored objects tangible as you jump between them, much like you would in Guacamelee or one of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor’s more challenging bonus rooms. It’s tough as nails, but absolutely exhilarating. And then there’s the motorcycle, which is responsible for some of the coolest moments in all of Ghostrunner 2. You’ll not only use it for high speed tunnel chases, but also as a key exploration tool in the back half of the story to explore huge open environments. Some of the best bits are when you’re speeding through a claustrophobic tunnel, quickly shifting to riding on the ceiling to avoid a hazard, or when you leap off your bike, send it careening towards a group of enemies, and then grapple hook right back on it. Ghostrunner 2 is full of moments like this where I had to take my hands off of the keyboard for a second and just admire how cool a game just made me feel. All of this is enhanced by a perfectly matched thumping electronic soundtrack that had my head bobbing all throughout. In addition to the campaign, there’s also a really fun side mode called Rogue Runner that cleverly uses the upgrades, enemies, and powers from the main game, mixes them in with randomized parkour and combat challenges, and turns it all into a very compelling roguelike formula. The way it works is that every run you start with just a basic set of moves, a limited number of lives, and you’re able to choose what type of level you play next; whether that be a combat level, a parkour level, or a harder version of those levels that promise a better reward. The levels themselves are procedurally generated, making it very important to be able to quickly read and understand the nuances of a particular challenge, since the element of trial and error is largely gone when you only have a handful of lives to take you through the whole mode. Beating a level may reward you with more lives, or you can choose one of three upgrade chips, most of which can be obtained in the main game, but some of which are exclusive to this mode. Ultimately, it’s an expanded version of the wave mode that was introduced as DLC in the first game, but it’s still nonetheless a compelling extra mode that I’m having a great time coming back to even after having completed the main campaign. Ghostrunner 2 is an electric sequel that supercharges everything that was great about the original and elevates it to a whole new level. The lightning fast, skill-heavy, one-hit kill combat is as exciting as ever, packed with even more tricks that give you plenty of new options to approach every scenario. The parkour also remains as smooth as silk, and some of the new motorcycle sequences are among the most exhilarating moments I’ve had all year. Those who didn’t vibe with the intensely reflex-heavy gameplay of the first Ghostrunner probably won’t be swayed by any of these improvements, but if the original was up your alley, I can’t imagine a better sequel than this. "
Super Mario Bros. Wonder ,9,"Every single Mario platformer game, 2D or 3D, seems to gleefully reinvent itself to some degree, doubling down on the unique delights that they bring me. Continuing that trend, Super Mario Bros. Wonder is very aptly named because, quite simply, it is full of wonder. Literally wonderful! Every frame oozes joy, from its bright colors to the Flower Kingdom’s ubiquitous talking flower, who’s never lacking in words of encouragement as you run and jump through dozens upon dozens of stages that are altered by unpredictable and often grin-inducing Wonder effects and, more often than not, the antics of Mario himself. Whether you enjoy it solo or with up to three friends, there’s a lot to love about Super Mario Bros. Wonder. Wonder catches the eye immediately. It dazzles due to its typical and welcome use of a wide variety of colors, with a particular emphasis on vivid blues, reds, greens, and yellows. But it’s particularly impressive in motion. With apologies to Yoshi’s Island, it looks like what you’d imagine a proper Super Mario World sequel should be if it were made in 2023 instead of 1995.  Animations are the undeniable standout here: Mario reaches back for his hat when he dashes into pipes, critters’ eyes bulge in fear as they run in terror from a pursuing plumber, Goombas have snot bubbles on their nostrils as they nap, Elephant Mario squeezes his giant, round body into warp pipes and – awkwardly – tries to make himself as small as he can when crouching under a low row of blocks. There are so many more! Those touches go a long way toward bringing Mario’s first trip to the Flower Kingdom to life. What is the Flower Kingdom? It’s a neighbor to the familiar Mushroom Kingdom, and it proved to be a refreshing setting mostly because it brought so many new and unique enemies for Mario to stomp on. Story-wise, you can already guess: A visiting Mario finds himself caught up in another Bowser caper, of course, as the reptile uses the land’s Wonder powers to fuse himself with the kingdom’s primary castle, making life miserable for its inhabitants. As always, the story is paper (Mario) thin, and you know you’re going to fight Bowsers Junior along the way. But it leaves no cloud hanging over the Flower Kingdom, because the dozens of stages across six main worlds – along with the Petal Isles hub that contains stages of its own – offer so many different looks and wild hooks that the typically forgettable story simply didn’t matter. Most levels include at least two Wonder Seeds, with one of them at the end and another hidden somewhere within it. Getting access to that hidden seed usually involves finding a Wonder Flower – sometimes hidden in blocks, bad guys, or in secret areas – that makes something unexpected happen. Sadly I’m not allowed to show you most of the best ones, but Mario might transform into a rolling spiky ball, or the camera might shift to a top-down perspective, or Mario and his enemies alike might morph into stretchy ink silhouettes, or he might turn into a Goomba who can’t jump or attack, or there might be a dance party. You just never know what will happen next. As such, I looked forward to the Wonder effects on every stage. They’re so much fun to experience that if I missed one in a level, I had plenty of motivation to run back in to find it. In short, the Wonders make the game. It certainly doesn’t hurt that each world packs entirely different groups of enemies that include mostly new foes, but with some callbacks to both staple classics like the cloud-riding Lakitus and deeper cuts like the Pokeys from Super Mario Bros. 2. Among the newbies, the Bulrushes come rushing at you and cannot be defeated by traditional stomping. But they can be ridden, which Wonder takes clever advantage of. The derpy looking Maw-Maws, meanwhile, look sweet, chill, and innocent – until they spot you, at which point their gaping maws open wide and will swallow you whole if you don’t jump very high very quickly. The Mumsies, on the other hand, pose little threat aside from their difficult-to-leap-over height, and I never got tired of grabbing onto their loose piece of cloth and unraveling them into oblivion. I hope we get to see the Flower Kingdom again someday because I don’t want this to be the only appearance for this fresh group of interesting new enemies. Another wrinkle in the 2D Mario formula comes in the form of Badges, a group of roughly two dozen unlockable active or passive effects you can choose to take into each level. Boosting Spin Jump lets you tap the right shoulder button to effectively double jump. Grappling Vine means even Mario games have grappling hooks now, Safety Bounce will let you survive a fall into lava, and Sensor pings more frequently as you get closer to key objects like large purple coins and (crucially) Wonder Flowers. These Badges give you some welcome control over how you tackle stages in a way that best suits your playstyle, not to mention offering a bit of replayability as a cherry on top. Some Badges can be purchased at shops, while others are earned when you complete Badge Challenge stages designed around that particular powerup. By comparison, buying a Badge with purple coins was unsatisfying, especially considering I was never short on them – I wish each of them had a fun challenge associated with it instead of just some of them. Speaking of new additions, Super Mario Bros. Wonder offers familiar four-player local and brand-new online multiplayer, with the online component being surprisingly seamlessly integrated. I don’t see it as appointment multiplayer gaming – couch co-op is still where it’s at in any multiplayer Mario game – but it works, and the friend races you can initiate on most stages can be a fun distraction from the primary platforming action. And whether you play on the same screen together or online, it is nice to see Nintendo put forth a more concerted effort to make multiplayer feel like a more organic part of the platforming, rather than a tacked-on afterthought, through things like Standees – which let you leave respawn points for your friends – and turning your pals into Ghosts that won’t physically get in your way during a precise jump or maneuver. But let me circle back to Elephant Mario for a second. Is he explained? Does he make any sense at all? Does it matter? No. Is he awesome? Yes. He is a dominant, Shaq-like force in Super Mario Bros. Wonder, complete with absolutely hilarious animations. A tap of the Y button sends smaller foes flying away when he swipes at them with his trunk. He can hold water in said trunk, too, dousing hot blocks and watering thirsty plants where needed. His sheer bulk even allows him to smash bricks with his trunk. He’s just a blast. Drill Mario is also a welcome addition. With a drill bit on his hat, he can burrow into the ground – or the ceiling! – to access hidden areas and spring up from below on unsuspecting bad guys. I can’t quite say the same for Bubble Mario. He blows large bubbles that can snag coins, slightly home in on and ensnare enemies, and be used as jumping pads, which is all useful enough. But when given the choice of which Mario form I wanted to take (just like in past Mario games, you can keep a powerup in reserve to switch back and forth as needed), I typically opted for Elephant Mario or good ol’ Fire Mario. Despite the joy radiating from most of the 2D Super Mario Bros. Wonder, it’s not quite up to par with the last mainline 3D Mario masterpiece, Super Mario Odyssey. The music, while not at all bad, is surprisingly forgettable this time around, and while there are some five-star difficulty stages – including an entire group of them I won’t spoil here – Wonder is a bit light on the challenge side of things, so there’s not as much here for seasoned series veterans as its predecessor has. Though in fairness, Mario is for everyone, and my daughter appreciated the inclusion of Nabbit as a playable character – when we played together, enemies couldn’t hurt her and we had more fun progressing through many of the stages. I nevertheless remain hungry for Mario’s next 3D adventure, especially as I watch the calendar surpass six years since Odyssey. Super Mario Bros. Wonder establishes a new standard for what 2D Mario platformers should look like. It is colorful, it is alive, and it is joyful. It also managed to surprise and delight me in continually more creative ways thanks to its unpredictable Wonder Effects, which transform levels into something completely different for a brief while. Like dessert in the middle of the main course of each stage, they were irresistible and always put a smile on my face – as did the absolute beast that is Elephant Mario. In every way other than advanced challenges, Wonder feels like a 21st-century successor to Super Mario World, and I’m not sure I can give it a higher compliment than that. "
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 ,8,"It’s funny how cartoons and comic books can influence your experience while playing a video game. While playing Marvel's Spider-Man 2 I kept thinking of the Sam Raimi movies, bits from both the cartoons from the nineties and the Spectacular Spider-Man show, to stories from the comics such as Secret Wars and Kraven’s Last Hunt. It’s a testament to the quality of writing from Insomniac Studios that they managed to make a Peter Parker and Spider-Man that feels like an amalgamation of everything that came before yet still feels like its own thing. Marvel's Spider-Man managed to set a fairly high bar for both Miles Morales and Spider-Man 2 to follow. The good news is that after about twenty-five hours of playing the game and reaching the credits it’s easy to see that Spider-Man 2 meets that high bar quite easily and in certain aspects manages to surpass both its predecessors.  The story starts about nine months after the events of the previous Spider-Man game. Peter is dealing with the loss of his aunt and Miles is having a hard time writing an essay which he needs for his admission to college. Like any great Spider-Man story from the comics display, it’s the duality of trying to have a normal life and dealing with the chaotic nature of the life of a superhero which both Spider-Men seem to struggle with throughout the story of Spider-Man 2. And how when they are doing well in one aspect, they seem to fall short in the other. Luckily, while both Miles and Peter deal with personal stuff, the gameplay as their respective Spider-Men is as great as always. Newly introduced is the Parry-mechanic, which allows you to give your opponents a strong wallop when they try to attack you and avoid incoming damage at the same time. Besides regular attacks, dodges and the use of gadgets both Miles and Peter have their own individual attacks that are tied to the R1 button and one of the face buttons of the controller. Miles is once again in control of his Bio-Electric power but due to certain story beats earns an evolution of said powers. Peter on the other hand fairly quickly in the story gets access to the powers of the symbiote suit which he gets from his best friend Harry Osborn. While previous games hinted at Harry’s fate being tied to his mother’s illness, the new game quickly sets the tone of the story in the sense that the stakes for most of the characters end up being fairly high. Harry’s illness seems to have been cured by the bio-organic suit that was developed by Osborn Industries, but the actual origin of the suit and what it brings to the story and the many twists and turns are best left to be discovered and enjoyed by players themselves. Suffice to say that if you’re a fan of the many Spider-Man stories of the past, you will find a lot of easter eggs and outright fanservice to geek out over in Spider-Man 2. iframe allow=""autoplay; fullscreen *"" allowautoplay="""" allowfullscreen=""true"" class=""gallery gallery"" data-src=""/marvels-spider-man-2/74180/gallery/embed""></iframe The gameplay of Spider-Man 2 is in many ways similar to the previous two games. You explore the world of New York City and its Burroughs, take out random crime events to earn tokens which you need for upgrades, do some awesome side quests that involve some excellent misdirection when it comes to what you might expect from certain characters and unlock many upgrades and costumes for both of the spiders to play with. While there are a total of sixty-five costumes to unlock, some of them also have optional extra colour schemes available. It gives players a chance to run, fight, swing and fly around the world dressed however they like. And yes, I did say fly. One of the better additions to Spider-Man 2 is the fact that you can now fly around the world by using web wings. Scattered around the city are grates that can give you an upward trajectory to soar high above the streets of New York. And there are also wind tunnels that allow you to move at a breakneck pace through crowded alleys and streets. Some of the sidequests are also tied into this new option and allow you to chase after certain flying droids as you try and download data from them. Fast as those chases may be though, it’s still nothing compared to how quick and easily you can switch between Peter and Miles on the fly. Opening the City app to track side quests and activities allows you to swap between both characters by pressing the square button. It’s simply instantaneous. What makes switching between both characters interesting is that they have a number of quests and missions that are unique to their story and path through the game. But it’s also fun to encounter the other Spider-Man while you’re out and about in the city. At random times it would happen that I responded to a random crime, only to find that the other Spider-Man was already dealing with the crooks I wanted to apprehend. From a technical standpoint the game looks amazing, and the gameplay was very fluid all throughout my time with the story. The game boasts a large number of options when it comes to graphical settings and accessibility for people with disabilities. The options range from Fidelity Mode which renders in 4K and 30fps, a Performance mode at 60fps and variable resolution and 4K Performance mode at 40fps that blends the qualities of the previous two settings but still looks great. While swinging through the world we noticed an amazing number of details. Reflections on the buildings and Ray Tracing were already a given in the previous games, but we oftentimes encountered people doing their thing inside buildings when we glanced through the windows. Another impressive feature is that events that happen during the story have a lasting impact on the surrounding area. Rampages from villains like The Lizard or Flint Marko’s Sandman will leave a completely devastated New York in their wake. And both Spider-Men will also end up with fairly damaged suits after prolonged damage being dealt to them. Luckily, sacrificing one of your skill bars can heal your character right up and quickly restore your suit as if it had been freshly washed by Aunt May. Though that’s obviously something Peter will have to do on his own now. Over the course of the campaign the score of John Paesano had some familiarity with the previous games but the new themes and the music in the second half have a lot of horror undertones that really added to the great atmosphere and tension of the story. Fans of the comics will also surely get a kick out of the many twists and turns of the story and the aforementioned fun little easter eggs that are littered across the game. While there were some story beats that could have had just a smidge more time to breathe or could have been expanded upon, the game does a great job of worldbuilding during the missions themselves. Background information can be found in files, in pictures or even in items if you take a proper look around. Sometimes these details are insignificant to the main plot but oftentimes they flesh out the story and hints at bigger things at play. As a sequel in a spectacular series, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is both blessed and cursed. Its story of two Spider-Men is a great time and a Spidey fan’s dream to play through as comic book pages are brought to life, elegantly walking the tightrope between light humour and heavier themes. Meanwhile, Insomniac refines a successful formula of combat and web-swinging without revolutionising either in major ways, making them comfy and familiar with just enough new tweaks and abilities to elevate them to fun new heights. The part that feels like it actually needed a radical rethinking is the open world of New York City, which has been made bigger but not better, with an exhausting checklist of mostly repetitious side activities. But it’s safe to call this another thrilling Spider-Man adventure that delivers Insomniac's best tale yet, and despite its open world falling short, it's a reliably fun superhero power trip. And, you know what? Screw it. It really did make me feel like Spider-Man, too. "
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 ,8,"With Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Insomniac has the unenviable task of following up two riveting superhero fantasies full of excitement and heart. While that may sound like a good problem to have, the question becomes where do you go from there? Well, its answer is to double down. Double down on Spider-Men. Double down on the size of the map. Double down on explosive action sequences. In doing so, the studio has crafted another consistently exciting rollercoaster ride and the best story of the series yet – but stand the original alongside this sequel in other ways, and it can look a bit like two Spider-Man games pointing at each other. The excellent combat hasn’t gotten old, but it is largely the same fun as before, and despite that larger map, most of the open-world activities found within it are in desperate need of evolution. The result is a blockbuster in the most modern sense of the word: undeniably thrilling for long stretches, but by the numbers for others. Despite a couple of new tricks up its sleeve, Spider-Man 2’s combat is very familiar – it doesn’t have that new suit smell anymore, but it still feels incredibly comfy to slip back into. The rhythm of precision dodges, the new perfect parries (so you’re not <i>only</i> swerving and striking now), and acrobatic finishers are hugely satisfying, as is chasing high-hit combos to keep the fight as stylish as possible. The movement is smooth and the hits are crunching, like some sort of peanut butter hybrid that every one of your foes is allergic to. Power and elegance are brought together in a brick-to-the-face ballet as enemies are thrown around like dolls, juggled in the air, slammed across concrete floors, and slung into each other like body-armoured bowling pins – but, naturally, never killed. Every bone in their body may be broken and every organ punctured, but of course, they'll somehow live to commit crimes again.  Overall, there’s slightly less emphasis on stealth encounters this time than in either Spider-Man or Miles Morales. As someone who found the stealth action of the previous games a little simplistic and routine, this new, louder approach is welcome. Naturally, there are story missions where Miles or Peter have to slink across ceilings and take out thugs who never look up, but Spider-Man 2 is much more eager for you to get into the action, with many abilities designed to let you group up enemies and then deal big damage to all of them at once, rather than spreading them out to pick them off one by one. A new personal favourite gadget called the Web Grabber – which pulls enemies in from a distance and makes them smack into one another – also playfully builds into this philosophy. I had a lot of fun using this before landing a sharp burst of Miles’ Venom lightning onto grouped-up goons, and now Peter can get in on that fun as well. It takes a bit longer than I expected to arrive, but once Parker dons the symbiote suit already shown off in trailers, the gooey, angry powers that come with it make a big impact, adding more of a brawler nature to fights and giving Peter a set of tools to match Miles’ satisfying electric abilities. They’re just as enjoyable, as it feels like the suit is trying to burst out of the rumbling DualSense controller in my hands. This aggressive style of play is rewarded, as the only way to heal is by building up your focus bar – filled by landing hits and timing perfect dodges – and is another way to make sure that exciting rhythm of combat is never lost. One area that Insomniac has made improvements in is that Spider-Man 2 offers significantly more in the way of enemy variety, so you’ll no longer be battering the same five balaclava bullies with baseball bats. New factions and units, such as flamethrower-wielding cultists that keep you at a distance, flying drones, and hunters who deploy laser grids above your head to limit aerial attacks keep you on your sticky toes. Certain enemies are weak to different types of abilities, such as electric or symbiote attacks, which also adds an enjoyable extra wrinkle to fights. It’s by no means revolutionary stuff, but a welcome added level of complexity that makes you consider which powers – or even which Spider-Man – are best for a given job. That's not to say there aren’t benefits to taking a sneaky route, though, especially when you’re playing as Miles and using his invisibility power to quietly take out enemies. There are many perch takedown possibilities offered and new toys to play with too, such as the Web Line, which allows you to create your own highwires over your enemies to prey on them from above. It’s a fun tool that allows you to reshape the tightly designed arenas into a battlefield more in your favour, and in doing so, redecorate the room with web-wrapped people piñatas. On the other hand, much like combat, stealth isn’t a far cry from the many warehouse encounters you’ll have played in the previous games, as you clear out enemies using largely the same techniques. Spider-Man 2 is, on paper, the perfect sequel. It takes all of the elements that made the first games so much fun and builds and improves on them. Bigger battles, improved ray tracing, wider story choices, more flamboyant combat, dual characters, improved visuals, staggeringly fast and dense city travel are all excellent. The sheer wow factor it delivers will impress, but some of the shine is dulled by comparison to Insomniacs own previous success and work on the remasters of the original and Miles Morales for PS5. Going from the original PS4 or even PS4 Pro Spider-Man games to this is a night-and-day difference in almost all areas, with the most noticeable being seamless loading, ray tracing, AI muscle deformation, vast performance increases and visuals that push the PS5 hard. But from the PlayStation 5 updates, the leap is smaller, if still impressive. None of this diminishes the excellent, varied and amazing game within, but just how amazing that is depends on when you last slipped into the tights of New York’s favourite web head. <i>– Michael Thompson, October 16, 2023</i Read the full <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-performance-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Spider-Man 2 Performance Review</a On the topic of covert ops, the playable MJ sequences from the original return, and while they are more involved this time around and serve the story well, they never add up to more than simple stealth missions or splashes of basic third-person shooting. She’s certainly not sidelined, but it does feel like a little more could’ve been done to make her gameplay sections a bit more exciting – or at least more in line with her established character as an intrepid investigative reporter than the missions she’s sent out on here. Combat aside, our Spider-Men can now swing around their friendly neighborhoods in more stylish ways than ever, with new spins and flips added to the repertoire providing a Tony Hawk-like edge. Performing web acrobatics is as gratifying as you remember, and still one of the best ways to get around any open world. The new web wings are undoubtedly a standout, however: like Batman before him, Spider-Man can now glide and soar with ease through the city, but not without limits – you’ll need to get the hang of managing your altitude and forward momentum, with the aid of windy corridors through the city that can quickly carry you from one district to the next. The story swings just as elegantly between upbeat hijinks and solemn moments of reflection. It's undeniably a fun time to don the suit and enter a Kratos-like rage mode where you push in both thumbsticks and start one-hitting everything in your path, but the writers never once forget to take their eyes off of the humanity inside these superhumans. The same can be said for both its heroes and villains, as Spider-Man 2 tackles the reasoning behind each character's actions and the good that can hide in the shadows of evil. For those with a hazy memory, there is a brief recap of both Peter and Miles’ stories so far available, which is handy, as this is very much a sequel that weaves in both plotlines and characters from the previous games and accompanying DLC. You won’t want to jump in for the first time here since Spider-Man 2 builds on the first two games both in its mechanics and its story – but of course, there’s little reason not to, since those games are also excellent. Avoiding spoilers, the basic premise revolves around Kraven the Hunter, who is, well, craving a hunt. For those uninitiated in the character, he's essentially The Predator, an Apex hunter blessed with super strength who has chosen New York as his next hunting ground. It's a great starting point that sends the city's hero and villain dynamic into flux as he sets his sights on the biggest prey possible. There are also smaller stories at play, though, ones that may seem less important when compared to city-wide chaos, but feel like potential world-enders to those who inhabit it. Both Spider-Men tackle the most extreme examples of trying to manage a work/life balance you can imagine, exploring a range of personal issues including strained relationships and loss that plague us as humans, no matter how superpowered we may feel. It's the best-written story in the series yet (if still a bit cheesy at times), with performances worthy of the script. It’s a real triumph that it manages to cover such a wide spectrum of themes without suffering from tonal thwip-lash. A particularly memorable mission under the dancing lights of Coney Island’s amusement rides is a highlight that manages to impressively capture the story’s essence and bottle up its emotional tension before emphatically smashing it. Primarily a Peter Parker story, Spider-Man 2 explores his relationship with MJ and the reintroduction of childhood best friend Harry Osborne into his life. It’s always compelling to watch him contend with which pieces of the past to leave behind and what future self he wishes to be. In some of the missions where you control normal, everyday Peter, I couldn't help but feel the Uncharted influence more than ever, both in the techniques it uses to tell his story and the show-stopping action sequences when he slips into the suit. No matter how hectic a scenario gets, though, he always has a quippy one-liner ready to be expertly delivered by actor Yuri Lowenthal. Miles still gets his time in the spotlight, however, and has some fantastic moments towards the end of the main campaign, even if some of the more interesting explorations of his Puerto Rican/African American culture are reserved for side missions. Obviously, what you take away from the story and its diverse cast of characters will be unique to you. On the surface, it's another thrilling superhero story packed full of surprises, cameos, and Easter eggs – but there are deeper meanings to be found here, too. Spider-Man 2, and to an extent all great Spider-Man stories, tackle themes of adolescence and puberty – a time of uncertainty for even the most normal of teenagers trying to control bodily fluids. We join Miles at this exact point in his life, with family ties straining, friendships facing fresh challenges, and life decisions of genuine importance being posed for the first time. Actor Nadji Jeter displays all the range needed for the role, continuing to excel as a younger Spider-Man maturing before our eyes. For Peter, these themes manifest in a much more physical sense. He's in his early twenties so has already navigated the difficult years that Miles finds himself in, but thanks to the symbiote suit, he's working his way through yet more bodily changes. This physical manifestation is also representative of mental health issues that have developed for each Spider-Man. Venom hangs over the main characters like a spectre of grief, drenching them in black as if in a state of mourning. The story does a great job at gently exploring these issues and how, when not healthily addressed, personal demons can eat at us and lead to people we care about being unintentionally caught in the crossfire of the anger and pain those feelings can produce. Of course, a hero is nothing without its villains, and Spider-Man's rogues gallery is almost unparalleled. Outside of the likes of Venom, Kraven, and Lizard seen in the trailers, Insomniac has kept many more cards hidden up its sleeve. I won't even hint at any of these except to say that Spider-Man 2 opens with a bang, offering up a sense of scale not previously seen in the series. It's an adrenaline-fuelled reintroduction to the series that tests how well you remember the combat, as well as providing a few new tricks. It's also the start of one of the new side-story villain threads that are optional, and while those don't offer anything overly new in terms of gameplay, they do add valuable extra scraps of story. They flesh out these villains, allowing fully formed characters to emerge where once they were merely one-and-done boss battle appearances. Speaking of boss battles, that’s one area that takes a noticeable step up from our initial tangos with Kingpin, Vulture, and the rest. One of my criticisms of the first in Insomniac's series was how uninspired many of the showdowns felt, with their quicktime-heavy fights making a light impact. Improvements were made in Miles Morales, but here in the full-fledged sequel, boss battles really come to life. You're made to wait a little too long for them sometimes, but when they do arrive they never fail to excite. They are evolving brawls packed full of danger that put all of your skills to the test. Dodges and parries are key, as well as using environmental tools dotted around the arenas for your benefit. The latter third of the campaign essentially becomes a boss rush mode that will put the sturdiest of thumbs to the test – not necessarily because it ever gets too difficult, but because of the sheer number of times you’ll be hammering that Square button. These later stages are where the majority of Spider-Man 2’s thrills lay, however, as it really hits its stride late on, and emphatically wraps up a tale with miles of emotional depth that never once threatens to peter out. The main story took me around 18 hours to complete before I hit 100%, and the subsequent platinum trophy popped up to congratulate my efforts after 27 in total. To earn that precious trophy, you’ll be spending a lot of time mopping up the many, <i>many </i>side activities that Spider-Man 2 throws your way – and while not everybody must or <i>should</i> do all of that, it’s a reminder that quantity doesn’t always equal quality. Despite whatever loftier ambitions the story may have, this is still unapologetically an old-school approach to open-world game design, and nowhere is this displayed more clearly than in its optional quests. To their credit, the way you can highlight side objectives by pressing the right stick is a welcome upgrade over mere icons on a map. Even without that, you can spot ominous clouds or glowing purple rooftops with the bare eye signaling activities are there to be found. This isn't a world that beckons exploration or discovery, necessarily, but it is a step in the right direction toward creating greater immersion and mercifully less time spent looking at the map screen. That being said, I can't help but have hoped for a few more flashes of Gotham City to make their way into New York. Something like the spontaneous shock of Manbat jumping at you out of nowhere went a long way to making Rocksteady's superhero open world feel more reactive than what we get here (even though it always cheated by finding ways to keep civilians off the streets). When you consider the evolution of open-world game design that the Arkham series took over the course of the trilogy, and its multilayered villain side quests, it’s a bit disappointing to see Insomniac’s series stuck in time when it comes to its side content and the way it presents itself to you. Standard open-world filler activities are here aplenty, and that’s one area where Spider-Man 2 hasn't moved with the times or shown ambition at all. Collectibles, photo opportunities, and rather basic street crimes are still here and, despite having a few slightly more interesting quirks this time around, they only very occasionally excite. You’ll regularly be stopping the same getaways with the same few button presses (the button-mashing from previous games is mercifully largely gone) or stopping a break-in by battering the same few goons. Granted, the additional enemy variety in play makes these activities take a little longer to get old than they did in the past, but that still isn't quite a strong enough twist to make prioritising photographing a couple of amateur cosplayers over saving a house full of people from a raging fire not seem ridiculous. Fun, quick side missions like helping a student ask their crush to homecoming or rescuing the Brooklyn Visions’ mascot from a rival school by solving a series of light and mirror puzzles add dashes of charm, but I'd love to see yet more life breathed into this world to match its visual splendor. These characters do add a bit more flavour to the world and its largely homogenous population of NPCs you’re clearly not intended to look at too closely. There are exceptions to the rule, however: there are a couple of more involved questlines that are much more nourishing, almost to the point of being a series of mini main plot missions. My favourite was The Flame questline, which begins with simply helping out the fire brigade, but quickly spins a layered and mysterious web. It's full of twists, turns, and surprises, like a great, short comic book run that separates itself from the rest of Spider-Man 2’s optional time trials and simple puzzle minigames. Rewards for completing these various activities vary, with some ranging from genuinely exciting story teases for what’s to come, to simply gaining some tech parts to upgrade your abilities with. The tasks are often so mundane and repetitive, however, that I did frequently question whether these small, congratulatory nuggets were worth the slog they too often turned out to be. All of this contributes to fighting back against crime in each district of New York, a city now twice the size of what we’ve seen before including the leafy residential roads of Queens and the bustling borough of Brooklyn. There are 14 unique districts, each with its own set of objectives to complete before you can unlock fast travel to that part of the map. Not making fast travel readily available is smart, and truthfully, I barely used it anyway as swinging and gliding around the city is so much more fun, even though the load times are nonexistent and the speedy, swooping camera effect of switching between Peter and Miles is very cool. Gliding is especially great for crossing long distances thanks to the numerous wind tunnels that carve their way through New York's seemingly endless grid of streets flanked by art deco architecture and modern mirror-like skyscrapers. Of course, if you’re going to be catching your ray-traced, 4K reflection (if you opt for the 30fps fidelity mode) in that glass so often, you’ll want to look your best. Fear not, because there are dozens and dozens of suits to unlock, with myriad colorful skins to pick from on each of them. From modern interpretations of classics to returning fan favourites, there are treats waiting for Spider-Man fans of all generations. They are now all pure cosmetics as well – a smart separation of form and function means picking the skills and abilities you equip are separate from your choice of suit. In keeping with Insomniac’s track record, the music behind it all is stellar, with Miles' and Peter's respective signature tunes playing depending on who you're controlling. A highlight, though, is the theme that follows in Kraven's footsteps, which bears more than a passing resemblance to Howard Shore's Uruk-hai war march from The Lord of the Rings score. It soundtracks a world that looks stunning, even when played in performance mode at a stable 60fps as I did for most of my playthrough. In fact, Spider-Man 2 is a technical marvel as a whole. From the near-instant load times, the ability to pinpoint a fast-travel location and be there in a second, atmospheric lighting, and crisp reflections, all of the pieces fit into place wonderfully – aside from the very occasional NPC getting stuck where they shouldn’t. I can't say that I noticed one dropped frame in my dozens of hours of playing. This allows Spider-Man 2 to shine in its most jaw-dropping moments – of which the main story offers many – as explosive action, sparkling electrical effects, and fittingly slimy symbiote gloop fill the screen. As a sequel in a spectacular series, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is both blessed and cursed. Its story of two Spider-Men is a great time and a Spidey fan’s dream to play through as comic book pages are brought to life, elegantly walking the tightrope between light humour and heavier themes. Meanwhile, Insomniac refines a successful formula of combat and web-swinging without revolutionising either in major ways, making them comfy and familiar with just enough new tweaks and abilities to elevate them to fun new heights. The part that feels like it actually needed a radical rethinking is the open world of New York City, which has been made bigger but not better, with an exhausting checklist of mostly repetitious side activities. But it’s safe to call this another thrilling Spider-Man adventure that delivers Insomniac's best tale yet, and despite its open world falling short, it's a reliably fun superhero power trip. And, you know what? Screw it. It really did make me feel like Spider-Man, too. "
Lords of the Fallen ,8,"If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again. While the original Lords of the Fallen from 2014 was one of the earliest to bravely take a stab at recreating FromSoftware’s lightning in a bottle, it didn’t quite hit that high mark. Nearly a decade and about a million soulslike copycats later, there’s perhaps no better time for its follow-up to take a second swipe – and thankfully, this new, confusingly identically named Lords of the Fallen confidently lands its strike. Its world, divided into dual realities, is absolutely awesome to explore, buildcrafting is diverse and complex, and combat is so smooth and satisfying that I’m willing to forgive all the ways it cribs from its contemporaries. Some pretty severe performance issues and bugs as well as disappointingly easy boss fights mean this latest thrust isn’t quite a fatal blow, but even so, I expect to spend many more hours impaling enemies and exploring every nook and cranny of its cleverly split world for secrets.   Lords of the Fallen is yet another entry in the action-RPG soulslike craze, complete with an unsettling fantasy setting, other players invading your game for some co-op or PvP goodness, and, of course, lots of dying. It makes use of the same sort of deadly third-person combat system full of dodge rolling, posture meters, and emoting over fallen enemies as a sign of utmost disrespect. A lot is borrowed from FromSoft classics (in this case, <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/30/dark-souls-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>Dark Souls</u></a> specifically), but there’s also quite a bit of unique stuff to get excited about, too. That includes things like some super cool dual-reality shenanigans, or a nifty magical lamp that lets you flay the souls right out of your enemies. And look, I know every time I review another one of these things, I always gripe about how absolutely flooded with new entries this genre is, but it really does bear repeating. There are a <i>lot </i>of these games nowadays. While more of a genre I enjoy isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it has become a tad disheartening to crack open a brand new game and feel like I already know exactly how 90% of it’s going to go because everyone’s using the same bag of tricks and tropes. It’s very weird, for example, that I can see a pile of boxes in the distance and think, “Ah, can’t wait for a monster to leap out from behind those and attack me,” or reach a swamp area and know, without question, that I’m going to be jumped by creatures who try to poison me. At this point I’ve started to lose track of which game’s healing items are called <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/04/dark-souls-3-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>Estus Flasks</u></a> vs. <a href=""/remnant-2/69725/review/remnant-2-review""><u>Dragon Hearts</u></a> vs. <a href=""/elden-ring/54119/review/elden-ring-review""><u>Flasks of Crimson Tears</u></a> vs. <a href=""/lies-of-p/72697/review/lies-of-p-review""><u>Pulse Cells</u></a> vs. <a href=""/from-software-new-project/23599/review/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review""><u>Healing Gourds</u></a> and so on to eternity. If those names all ring a bell, expect plenty more deja vu here. If “Lords of the Fallen” sounds familiar to you as well, that’s because it shares its name with the 2014 game from developer Deck13 – but as the lack of a “2” or something similar might suggest, <i>this</i> Lords of the Fallen isn’t a sequel so much as a full on reboot. Those who played the original will definitely hear NPCs talk about some familiar (and sometimes nonsensical) setting terms like “The Rhogar” and “Adyr,” or see really cool and recognizable sights like the giant outstretched hand of a fallen god in the distance, but new developer Hexworks only used the most basic elements from the previous version. The good news is that this fresh story it’s telling using some refurbished, dusty bits is much better than its predecessor, and the world feels much more fleshed out. There’s some interesting characters here and there and some cool lore and worldbuilding to enjoy as you meet various factions that you can side with or work against, even if that stuff sometimes feels buried under a mountain of generic dark fantasy gobbledegook (like the super original concept of using “Charred Fingers” when invading other players’ world). Though Lords of the Fallen certainly borrows a lot from its genre peers, its biggest original idea is also its best: the dual realms you can swap between at any time. Axiom, the physical world most people perceive, lies atop a ghostly world of dark abominations and creepy eyeballs called Umbral which you can access using a magic lantern. As you run around killing bosses and kicking scrubs off of ledges, you’ll need to navigate both, which adds a really novel new way to explore the environment. For example, you might encounter a broken bridge in the normal world, but by diving into Umbral you’ll be able to cross it using an organic, gray platform only visible and tangible by entering the spooky world of darkness – it sorta reminds me of the eerie plane Frodo enters when he puts on the One Ring, except a lot more useful and less out of focus. This mechanic has an enormous impact on nearly every aspect of Lords of the Fallen, from combat where normally imperceivable enemies become a major threat when you enter Umbral, to exploration since each area essentially has two versions, warranting multiple runs through the same section to see what you missed. Lords of the Fallen delivers entertaining hack-and-slash combat centered on combos and spells, but its risk-based reward system seems slightly out of place in a world where its hero so easily achieves great power and defense and makes risk obsolete. It achieves its goal of creating a more accessible Dark Souls-style experience, but unfortunately it goes a step or two too far. – <i>Leif Johnson, October 27, 2014</i Read the full <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/28/lords-of-the-fallen-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lords of The Fallen (2014) review</a  Even cooler is the fact that you can interact with the Umbral plane without entering it, by holding your trusty lamp to see a small piece of it come into view around you. Doing so allows you to do things like pass through physical barriers that don’t exist in the other world and get a sneak preview of stuff that might lie hidden on the other side before switching over fully. This makes exploration less about running from point A to point B and more about taking your time to understand each area and look for secrets as you swap between realities and use your lamp to shed light on how they differ. It’s also pretty awesome that if you ever get slain by the enemy, instead of dying, you’ll be involuntarily pulled into Umbral, giving you one last chance at life. To escape back to the real world, you have to find totems hidden throughout this shadowy one or return to a checkpoint to rest, but more and more powerful enemies begin to infinitely spawn and hunt you down the longer you stick around. It’s a shame, though, that Lords of the Fallen doesn’t quite seem capable of supporting its cross-dimensional ambitions from a technical standpoint, as it suffers some pretty serious performance issues in the attempt. Even with my GeForce RTX 4090 GPU and Ryzen 9 7950X3D CPU, I encountered stuttering and dropped frames on a fairly regular basis, especially after prolonged sessions. Sometimes these issues were so consistent I felt serious eye strain and had to reboot my PC in hopes things would improve at least for a little while, and the problems were shared in some form or another by everyone I played with. It’s especially frustrating when lost frames lead to me taking hits I otherwise may have avoided, or when my co-op partners got killed after their game turned into a slideshow during multiplayer (where performance is sometimes even worse). I’m not usually one to whinge about performance benchmarks or less-than-perfect framerates, but these were so consistent and impossible to ignore that it was like eating a delicious meal with a severe toothache and a cut on the roof of my mouth. I hope this sort of stuff will be patched out before too long, but for now, those severe problems are impossible to ignore. Thankfully these areas are still a ton of fun to explore when Lords the Fallen’s framerate manages to behave, from the fiery ashes of the city of Calrath to the treacherous steps of a monastery in the mountains. Level design is some of the best of the genre in recent memory, with interesting (and often breathtaking) environments, tons of secrets to discover, and loads of unique enemies to fight, introduced one at a time via miniboss fights throughout the roughly 40-hour campaign. Lords of the Fallen also draws clear inspiration from the first Dark Souls specifically, in that it tries very hard to connect every area of the map to a central hub, and has lots of opportunities to unlock shortcuts and backtracking paths – though it does so at the cost of being annoyed by about 15 doors that can’t be opened from the side you’re on every hour or so. Taking down armies of wretched skeletal abominations is a lively whirlwind of blades and flails being swung and parried, making it play more smoothly than the vast majority of its peers, even if that dance feels extremely conventional at this point. You can be a brawny bruiser wielding the ol’ reliable sword and board, a quick and precise <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/bloodborne-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>Bloodborne</u></a> dude, or a variety of ranged magic users with cool but by-the-numbers abilities like covering levels in fire and lava or blessing you and your allies with health regenerating effects. Upgrading weapons, spells, and slotting runes and other upgrades into your equipment to give them special modifiers helps extend that buildcrafting variety even further. With nine starting character classes to choose from (and four more that can be unlocked later) there’s tons of room for replayability and a variety of interesting playstyles, which is one of my favorite aspects of any action-RPG.  It’s also great that many of the areas you’ll fight your way though are legitimately challenging, often filled with elite enemies who swarm you with devastating attacks in claustrophobic environments that have numerous ways to get yourself killed. Getting pulled into the Umbral realm piles on even more enemies and danger too, which is a fun, sweat-inducing time. Really the only issue is that enemies are as dumb as a bag of hair, which isn’t exactly a unique problem in the genre, but it’s always amusing to see these morons try to figure out how to navigate the world’s geometry only to stand in place as you repeatedly hit them with balls of lightning. Not content with just being awesome for exploration, your magical lamp and its relationship to the parallel Umbral realm is also quite useful in combat, primarily because you can use its Soul Flay ability to rip out an enemy’s soul, stopping them in their tracks and providing ample time to dish out damage. If you’re feeling more rude, you can even toss their soul over a cliff, so when their body finally catches up they fall to their death – extremely useful for disposing of troublesome baddies foolish enough to engage you near a cliff’s edge. Also, some enemies will have supernatural protection that makes them nigh invincible, the only remedy being using your lamp to cast light on a nearby hidden eyeball to strip them of that protection. Finding ways to play with the dual-reality swapping during combat really drives home just how dope that mechanic is. Another neat new idea is Vestige Seeds, which can be planted in various designated locations throughout the world to manifest semi-permanent checkpoints at intervals of your choosing. So if you’re having trouble with a certain section and don’t want to deal with the pressure of dying before you reach the next static checkpoint, you can use a Vestige Seed to create a safe haven along the way and take baby steps to your final destination. This adds a really nice minigame where you’re deciding when to stop and spend a seed, and when to push your luck and see if you can make it through the next few rooms before saving your progress. And obviously no soulslike would be complete without epic boss fights against disgusting monstrosities, and Lords of the Fallen has some cool ones, such as a a giant crow who tries to bury you in ice or a dragon-riding abomination who shows up to hunt you down throughout your adventure. Unfortunately, unlike the levels preceding them, they’re not very challenging at all. Every boss comes at you with slow and telegraphed moves, surprisingly reasonable health bars, and plenty of breaks in the action to heal up thanks to the simple AI, making death a pretty rare occurrence against them. Many of these fights only really serve to introduce a new elite enemy that will be used more regularly later on, too, making them pretty unremarkable. It’s still entertaining to take on enormous beasts despite them being pushovers, but even some of the more unique fights seem subpar compared to the bar set by recent soulslikes.  There’s also just a pretty sizable layer of jank around this otherwise awesome package. I saw a few game crashes, had cool combat encounters ruined when enemies got stuck helplessly in the environment, was locked out of certain button commands like blocking for stretches of time, and more. Plus, there’s some weird non-bug wonkiness, like how resting at a checkpoint triggers a loading screen every single time – sometimes Lords of the Fallen has original Dark Souls energy in a pretty unflattering way. Playing with a friend can make some of those rough edges even more noticeable, since it introduces other questionable quirks, like how co-op partners are tethered to the host and get teleported if they stray too far, which is accompanied by a loading screen. But these loading screens often take just long enough for the host to have traveled out of sight again by the time you load back in… leading to yet another loading screen. You also can’t tell where the host is due to a bizarre lack of any kind of in-world indicator pointing you in your friend’s direction, making it easy to lose sight of them and become separated.  That said, playing with a friend is still a good time, and provides the assisting player with plenty of resources and items along the way – and without kicking them back to their own world after every boss fight, as FromSoft games often do. What I’ve played of New Game+ so far also has me and my squad quite excited to go back through some of the areas and enemies, with new lore, a whole new skill tree to experiment with, and, of course, more difficult baddies to slay. That increased difficulty hasn’t made any of the boss fights very challenging yet, which is a bummer, but the stretches between them are worth it on their own. Lords of the Fallen is a great soulslike, and its killer new idea of swapping between two versions of the world to solve puzzles and slay enemies is an excellent twist to set it apart from the pack. That concept is unfortunately hamstrung by numerous, highly annoying technical issues and weak boss fights, but awesome explorable areas and fantastic buildcrafting more than make up for those shortcomings. If, like me, you’re a sucker for a quality action-RPG even amid a clear overabundance of them, then this reboot is well worth your time. "
Total War: Pharaoh ,8,"The most impressive part of Total War: Pharaoh isn't the beautifully-detailed map of the Nile Valley, the exciting Late Bronze Age setting, or the striking interface that looks like it was copied straight off of a tomb wall in the Valley of Kings. It's the fact that Creative Assembly Sophia has pulled me right back into a fairly traditional, historical Total War and made it feel like a fresh experience, even when I've been playing this series for over 20 years now. It has some rough edges, especially the further you get from the heart of Egypt. But that little bit of sand in my sandals is easy to endure when Pharaoh is at its best. Egypt itself is really the star of Total War: Pharaoh, and whether you're on the campaign or the battle map, it makes its personality known with wonderful art, effective lighting, and challenging geography. It would be easy to imagine dozens of repetitive battles fought on bumpy sand, but there are many riffs on the general themes of sunbaked flood plains and rocky desert peaks that lend a sense of place and new tactical possibilities. I particularly came to enjoy hiding my troops just behind the sharp crest of a soaring sand dune when facing an army with elite archers, only springing the trap when they were close enough that their ranged advantage was meaningless.  The winding snake of the Nile and the inhospitable deserts on either side strongly shaped every strategic decision I made, too. Sailing the river itself is by far the fastest way to get anywhere, so sticking close to it is like having access to a super highway. It cuts both ways, though. Especially later on when the Sea People are invading in force, they can swiftly slink upriver to bypass your strongest defenses, which led to some exciting chases to catch them before they could torch the soft underbelly of my empire. On the other end of the spectrum, crossing open desert with no established paths causes appropriately punishing attrition unless you stop and camp regularly, which can slow you down to a crawl. Cleverly, every settlement is connected by roads to somewhere. But on the fringes, they're often not connected to their closest neighbors as the crow flies. You may even need to go two or three provinces North or South to find an ideal route, so speed versus safety was always an interesting consideration. Add in the near-constant threat of Libyan invaders in the West, always targeting my hardest-to-access settlements, and I really felt the welcome pressure I'm looking for in a Total War grand campaign. Relative to other recent Total Wars, Pharaoh is noticeably more challenging. I often play on Very Hard in <a href=""/total-war-warhammer-iii/53934/review/total-war-warhammer-3-single-player-review"">Warhammer 3</a>, and I found that even stepping down to Hard in this one gave me enough pushback that I had to start four or five campaigns before I really got a good run going. That's a satisfying balance point. Starting in the South as the Kushite Viceroy Amenmesse, the civil wars and foreign invasions bleeding Egypt dry kept me on my toes for more than 100 turns before my snowball – or is it a sandball? – got too big to be stopped. I was a bit disappointed by the last, huge, apocalyptic wave of the Sea People invasion, as I was able to deal with it fairly easily by that point. But to be fair, I had all of Lower Egypt, at the mouth of the Nile, serving as a filter between me and the sea. If I was hanging out in the delta, I might have had a more thrilling endgame. Even if the Sea People weren't ruining my day directly, their burning of city centers outside my borders was definitely felt even down in Nubia. The Bronze Age Collapse is modeled by a bar that slides from prosperity, to crisis, to collapse, with stacking bonuses for the invaders and penalties for the settled factions the lower it goes. The idea that I was making my way up the Nile and rebuilding civilization as I went, pulling the world out of a dark age punctuated by eerie changes in sound and lighting, served as a decent motivation to keep pushing even after I'd achieved my standard victory objectives and was too strong to really be challenged. The richness of the campaign is enhanced by what may be the most in-depth set of empire management mechanics in any Total War so far. There's a whole new layer to every settlement for outposts, which are smaller sub-buildings that have their own physical location, and can be anything from the unique Valley of the Kings monument to a fort that can be staffed with a full stack of defending troops. The latter allowed me to defend some very far-flung areas without needing to station a general, and changed how I approached offensive wars. In a province with a fort, you usually want to ""set a pick"" with a smaller army, to borrow a sports term, and then go after the main settlement with your larger army, so you don't have to fight both garrisons at once. The ability to build waystations, trading posts, and temples, which give you some movement points back once visited, can also create a speedy overland travel network in the developed areas of your empire – but a single raid to knock out one link in the chain may leave your armies stranded. This all speaks to the cleverness and care with which CA Sophia has layered more interesting decisions and play style choices onto this venerable formula. And that's without even digging into the robust, hands-on systems for court politics, civil wars, and earning the favor of the gods. Some of these mechanics are afflicted by a minor plague of bugs, though. I got to use my Legacy power, following in the footsteps of Thutmose the Conqueror, only once before it seemed to freeze up and never grant me any rewards for my future victories. One of the powers you unlock after becoming Pharaoh that is supposed to allow you to forcibly annex smaller factions of your culture simply wasn't usable on anyone, and the tooltip became a blank, white box, so I couldn't even figure out why. Influence, which determines how dominant your culture is in a region, is also a very opaque mechanic with inadequate tooltips that can really only be mastered through trial and error. And unfortunately, a lot of the best aspects of the campaign only shine brightly if you're playing in Egypt. To be fair, Egypt itself is a massive, fulfilling canvas to paint the story of your empire upon. In my 120+ turns as Amenmesse, I didn't even reach the borders of Canaan. But the peripheral areas beyond the Sinai Peninsula definitely didn't get the same attention and flavor. It'd be a bit unfair to say they feel tacked on, but this is definitely a game about Egypt where everyone else is a side story. Each region looks just as beautiful and detailed as the Nile. The green mountain valleys of Hatti almost feel like a different world when you've been choking on dust in the Sahara for ages. But they also feel cramped, and weirdly cut off. For instance, the playable part of Anatolia slices off the Western and Northern coasts of the peninsula, which just feels awkward and unnatural. Even in Egypt's case, I wouldn't say the spot they chose to end the map in the South makes much sense, missing the ancient city of Meroë that was hugely important to the Kingdom of Kush, which features prominently in Egyptian politics. And having a game about the Late Bronze Age that doesn't include the Mesopotamian heavy-hitters like Assyria, Elam, and Babylon – just off the edge of Pharaoh's map – gives the whole epic an aftertaste of incompleteness. I genuinely hope we get some DLC that takes things a bit further East. The outer regions also lack the political richness of Egypt. The Hittities only have two playable characters and two Ancient Legacies to pursue, compared to Egypt's four and four. That means there are really only four different playstyles for them, compared to Egypt's 16, since you can mix and match any legacy with any character. Suppulilumia is a punishingly difficult but interesting run as you try to salvage a collapsing kingdom, but I never got over the feeling of being boxed in by the weird map borders. And the geography of Anatolia doesn't create the same interesting, strategic puzzles as Egypt. Canaan doesn't even have its own royal traditions. Bay is basically an Egyptaboo who wants to become Egyptian himself – which is good, in a way, because it points him toward a more interesting part of the map. But if you want to play a Canaanite who stays in Canaan, you're basically stuck with Irsu. And I hope you like raiding, because that's his entire thing. I didn't enjoy what I played of his campaign much. At least every faction has a wide roster to pull from, and the many cultures sprinkled across the world each offer something different. The Hittites are the masters of the heavily-armored infantry line. Kush and Nubia have by far the best archers. Even within Egypt and Hatti there are multiple subcultures with their own native units which can be recruited simply by owning a settlement in the right area, regardless of which faction you are. This allows building multi-ethnic armies that combine the strengths of many tribes, which is thematically and tactically satisfying. The pacing of the battles is great, too, with infantry engagements slowed down noticeably from other recent Total Wars. I always prefer that, since it allows more room to maneuver and make small, clutch plays to eke out a win. Unit weight classes mix up the typical rock-paper-scissors dynamic of swords, spears, and bows, with light but fast infantry often able to chase down and overwhelm units that are more powerful on paper. The fact that armor can now be worn down and damaged throughout a battle gives a new role to club and mace units, as they specialize in exactly that. And the addition of weather effects like thunderstorms and sandstorms is not only visually awesome, but can turn the tide for one side or another. Chariots are… still chariots. The amount of micro required to get the most out of them generally makes them not worth using at all. We're in an age before cavalry, so they're the most mobile units you'll ever get access to. But I just don't enjoy playing with them, nor have I ever in any Total War game. How would you fix this? I'm not sure. But until they do, I'd almost always rather have one more unit of infantry. Total War: Pharaoh looks incredible, with diverse and interesting battles complemented by an uncommonly deep and rich campaign layer. The focus is firmly on Egypt, and the experiences available outside that region don't really match up in terms of content or quality to what is on offer to the civilizations of the Nile. But when I'm sailing up and down that majestic river, fending off invasions from hostile tribes, politicking my way to the top of the power pyramid, and sending my besandaled soldiers to spill blood across the shining sands, I feel confident in saying historical Total War is back, baby. Creative Assembly Sophia has refined every part of its take on this franchise since Troy, and the results are just shy of glorious. "
Detective Pikachu Returns ,6,"When Detective Pikachu hit the 3DS in 2016, we’d never seen anything quite like it in the vast collection of Pokemon games. Its casual whodunit story was an easy solve, but it was cute, colorful, and most importantly, different. And yet, now that Detective Pikachu and his tiny herringbone hat have returned, it doesn’t feel as exciting as its predecessor. In fact, there’s a lot about the mystery solving that’s arguably a step backwards. It’s somehow easier than the first one, which makes a lot of the moment-to-moment play feel long-winded and a bit frustrating, especially if you’re more than 10 years old. It’s still a pleasing, colorful, sweet adventure, and the story comes to a mostly satisfying conclusion of the Detective Pikachu saga, but its greatest mystery is what went on behind the scenes that resulted in some of these baffling decisions in the story and mechanics.   Since it’s been a good while, it was wise for this sequel to be written so that you didn’t need to play the first Detective Pikachu (or seen the movie, for that matter) to hop into Returns – Pikachu recaps the first game in the very beginning with his trusty cup of coffee by his side. The world is still feeling the effects of the events from the first game, where Tim Goodman and the titular detective helped stop the spread of R, a drug that caused Pokemon to go berserk. However, things seem to be ramping up again in Ryme City, where Pokemon are once again acting strangely and a mystery is brewing in the background as you solve other cases. Plus, there’s the matter of figuring out what happened to Tim’s father and Pikachu’s partner, Harry. Unlike in the first game, where R was introduced early and the mystery involved who was behind it, Detective Pikachu Returns tries something different. It introduces a lot of parts early on without specifically revealing the purpose of the puzzling objects at its center, and then takes its time explaining their meaning. Without getting into too many details, a priceless gem is stolen, but then that stone becomes central to the larger events, but its true purpose remains unknown for most of my estimated 17-hour runtime. Even though there are a lot of other moving parts, it’s not too complicated to figure out their places in the plot, and it’s still satisfying to watch them come together. It’s a bit predictable, though, and you’ll very likely figure it out way before the characters do. Detective Pikachu Returns does manage to pull off a few surprises by subverting some obvious mystery tropes around butlers perpetrating crimes, and alliances shift unexpectedly. But it’s still a story where the most obvious suspect in each case is likely the culprit, and the ending you expect is what you typically get. As I mentioned, this is a family-oriented visual novel, so none of the cases are too complex. In fact, it seems like Nintendo has taken it down a notch from the first one, which was already clearly targeted at younger players. Gone are many of the more complicated puzzles and how the clues and evidence are laid out. Previously, you had to sometimes approach an investigation by picking apart a conversation and highlighting a word, or having to decipher symbols that even Detective Pikachu won’t reveal the answer to. Gathering clues in Detective Pikachu Returns is even more straightforward: you collect them and then Pikachu prompts you to deduce what they mean together in your new case notebook. For example, you’ll wander around Ryme City collecting testimony from witnesses or looking closer at certain crime scenes for anything amiss, but it’s unlikely you’ll interact with any of the evidence beyond that. You also get optional side quests where you can help out people and pokemon, and while they’re not necessary for the plot, they’re usually good for a laugh – the exception being a quiz professor who, all too often, has you backtracking to interact with Pokemon in the area to solve her relatively easy riddles. I occasionally got tripped up when I wasn’t paying close attention to a conversation that had gone on too long, but for the most part, the clues are presented and then explained almost immediately. Is there a diagram that shows a person lifting a Pokemon up to unlock a door? You’ll probably have to lift up Pikachu to unlock a door. Did a bunch of Pokemon report that they fell asleep after eating breakfast? That’s probably important to remember. And if you don't get it correct the first time, you aren’t punished for your mistake – you just try again until you get it right. Returns doesn’t really have puzzles, but rather a series of testimonies you have to collect and keep track of. Pikachu, Tim, and the rest of the characters need every piece of evidence to have realizations, so like the last game, you’re forced to break down your entire thought process in the notebook. Detective Pikachu offers a bold take on the iconic Pokemon, which succeeds thanks to Pika Prompts that build Pikachu beyond detective stereotypes. Even though I figured out cases far before their end, each one utilized the world of Pokemon to its fullest, and ultimately offered a unique Pokemon experience that I hope we see done again soon. <i>– Miranda Sanchez, March 22, 2018</i Read the full <a href=""/detective-pikachu/12043/review/detective-pikachu-review"">Detective Pikachu review</a It’s not that it’s that difficult to keep everything organized, just inconvenient. Previously, you could view your notes and make deductions on the second of the two 3DS screens even if you were in a conversation; on the Switch’s single screen you have to jump into menus to view them instead. This might not sound like a huge change, but it does mean that you’re unlikely to look at evidence as you go. Granted, you probably won’t need to look at your notes much since most answers to questions are more obvious than Tim or Pikachu realize, but I only hopped into the menu when I had found every clue and Pikachu said it was time to start deducing. It was also just not fun to look at. At least the first game’s notebook featured Tim’s line drawings and looked like a yellow-lined piece of paper. Now, it just looks like a generic video game menu covered in tiny polaroids. The get-out-of-jail-free card is that all of this simplicity is fine if you’re making a game for younger players. People who are looking for a laidback time also might not mind it. But at the same time, Detective Pikachu Returns is kind of a dark story. The first one didn’t shy away from some mature storytelling moments, and it’s not outside the Pokemon franchise’s purview to feature pokemon getting kidnapped, trafficked, or tortured, but I was taken aback when I realized where Returns was going. Without revealing what happens in the second half, it goes to some places I wasn’t expecting to see in a game that’s ostensibly for children. It doesn’t handle a lot of its themes delicately either, but then again, Pokemon isn’t exactly known for its nuance. It just makes you wonder: who is this for? Why would they make the gameplay simpler and the story darker? Another one of the biggest disappointments with Detective Pikachu Returns is its art style. Pokemon games aren’t renowned for being gorgeous or intricate, especially over the past couple generations, but Returns looks more like a 3DS game than the original did, and that actually <i>was</i> a 3DS game. It’s especially lacking when it comes to facial animations – each character has maybe two expressions and they’re both neutral, which can be a problem when tragic or dire events are happening. It’s tough to get invested in the actual high stakes of the story when Tim just looks slightly shocked. But you’re likely not playing a Pokemon game for dazzling sights, and at the very least, this is still an improvement over the first one. The lines are cleaner, the colors are brighter, and the character movement is smoother. The animations are even detailed when they need to be.. Pikachu, for example, has an adorable little run where his head leans back and his whole body juts forward, which made me giggle every time he hustled around the screen. There are moments where he rides around on the backs of other pokemon to solve puzzles and get through previously cut-off areas, and the way the artists chose to integrate him with each is unique to that pokemon’s features. At the very least, Detective Pikachu Returns has moments where it’s visually charming, and a couple where it can even elicit laughs.  Like with the first one, the pokemon are why you play, and there are so many to discover here including return favorites like Mewtwo and others from across the spectrum of rarity and types. Some you just get to talk to, but others are a big help, and most manage to stand out despite little screentime. And because the Pokemon series has always been about how pokemon are special in their own unique ways, each one has their own abilities to lend. Growlithe, which is one of the first you get to hang out with, has a keen sense of smell that lets her find objects or other pokemon, while Darmanitan can break down rocks and other barriers while you ride around in the fluff on his head. Pikachu is the most special of all, of course. That hasn’t changed. The story is about him, after all, so it only makes sense that he gets the best scenes and dialogue. It’s a joy whenever he gets one of his “bolts of brilliance” and has to strike a pose or when he gets snarky. Even with just a couple short conversations, Detective Pikachu Returns manages to flesh out its world at least a little bit by imbuing random pokemon with personality and a desire for connection or happiness. The human characters, sadly, don’t get the same treatment. Tim is as dull as ever, just following around Pikachu and commenting on events with a straight face. We meet new characters like Rachel, who tags along on many of your investigations, but she too mostly just follows you around and doesn’t contribute much else at all. Detective Pikachu Returns is overall, though, a Pokemon game, so maybe it’s fine that the humans are no more animated than a block of wood. And it nails the tenets of the series. It’s about friendship, community, generosity, and making the world better for pokemon as well as humans. It might sound trite, but sometimes that’s nice to see. The mystery story of Detective Pikachu Returns makes some bizarre and unexpectedly dark choices to get to its underwhelmingly predictable conclusion, and as a result it’s unclear who this is all for. Is it for young kids who will find the simplified puzzles about right, or adults who grew up with Pikachu and can handle the more mature themes of the second half? It’s still a cute, bubbly, animated adventure with humor, unique pokemon to meet, and a mystery to solve, but the mystery solving is long-winded, the visuals are lackluster, and the gameplay is so basic it might as well not be there at all. "
Forza Motorsport ,8,"Sitting on the grid in my 2017 Holden V8 Supercar, surrounded by Lamborghinis, Ferraris, and Audi R8s, I have to concede I’m feeling a little underqualified. Forza Motorsport’s online multiplayer spec racing should technically place all these cars on a level field, but I can’t help but feel like I’ve brought a cricket bat to a swordfight here. Several mediocre laps later and neither myself or my Vegemite-eating VF Commodore have troubled the timesheets much, finishing mid-pack one spot below where I started – but I’m sweating, and I’m smiling. The 2023 version of Forza Motorsport is brimming with new features across the board, from its muscular new multiplayer to its much-improved handling. All except for its upgrades, that is. They’ve been downgraded. Confused? Me too. Forza Motorsport is, by a significant margin, the best feeling game in the Motorsport franchise to date. It isn’t necessarily a total reinvention of the Forza formula, and it still has that familiar level of forgiveness baked into it when you’re at and <i>just</i> <i>beyond </i>the limits of control. This is a series that has always been about letting us have the confidence to grab a car by the scruff of its neck and step the rear end out with a boot-full of throttle without constantly over-rotating, and that’s absolutely still the case here. The improvements <i>before</i> we break traction, however, are marked.  If the previous game, Forza Motorsport 7, has any noticeable handling blemishes, it’d be that there’s often a lack of bite to the feeling of grip. Six years later, that’s totally gone here in this follow-up. The feeling of grip in Forza Motorsport is far more pronounced and authentic, and cars feel more realistically rooted to the road than they ever have previously. Push beyond the capacity of your tyres and grip will now taper away instead of falling off a cliff, meaning cars squirm more and skate less – which is a great improvement. The pleasing side-effect of these terrific tyre modelling improvements goes beyond making racing feel more accurate; it also actually makes it feel <i>easier</i> to drive fast. ‘Easy’ is too often used as a pejorative in a gaming context but, with respect to those who can’t feel feelings until they’re being flayed alive by a FromSoft game, in racing terms I can assure you it’s not a contemptuous concept. Lapping as fast as the pros, millimetre perfect and at maximum attack? No, that’s <i>not</i> simple – if it was, we’d all have yachts in Monaco by now. But hustling around a track quick and hard, confident the car beneath you is going to behave as it should? That’s well within the means of a competent driver. The old sim racing mentality that “if it’s not difficult, it’s not realistic” is something that most good driving simulators have been moving away from for some time, and Forza Motorsport is no exception. It’s easier because it’s <i>more</i> authentic. Gamepad handling is extremely well-refined. While it’s hardly a surprise considering good gamepad handling has always been a staple of this long-running series, I’m happy to report it remains top-notch and has survived the physics updates beneath the surface. As usual, the team at Turn 10 has struck a terrific balance between softening things like rapid weight transfer and certain steering inputs to keep the handling tameable on a tiny analogue stick, but still demanding an indisputable deftness to drive consistently fast. On a wheel, my experience is limited to the Thrustmaster TS-XW Racer – but it definitely errs extremely heavy out of the box. Surprisingly so, in fact. The last time my actual car felt this heavy to pilot it was because my alternator failed and killed my power steering. It is, however, extremely tuneable – so I was able to eventually dial that aggressive heaviness out and enjoy what I otherwise consider the best Forza Motorsport wheel feel I’ve ever experienced. There might be a slight numbness to severe kerbs, but the responsiveness and stability is excellent. The feeling of car weight is also great – especially on undulating and technical track sections like cresting over the rise at Laguna Seca before slamming down through the corkscrew. There are some small, welcome touches for wheel users, too. Those who play in cabin-view with the wheel visible may be happy to see the steering animation is no longer locked to just 90 degrees in either direction. The on-screen wheel now rotates up to 360 degrees, which is far more realistic. There are also car-specific force feedback and steering lock settings in the tuning menus, making it easier to keep cars feeling right without constantly re-adjusting the global settings. There’s more good news on tuning, including a new layer of suspension settings as well as the ability to add ballast. Adding ballast obviously increases car weight and lowers its performance index overall, but it is automatically distributed throughout the car to bring it closer to a perfect 50/50 weight distribution. It’s impossible to instantly gauge the impact the addition of ballast will have on competitive car builds, but it will be interesting to watch and experiment to see whether pushing a car over the limit before handicapping it with extra weight is a viable strategy on certain tracks. Unfortunately, that’s currently where the positive news on tuning – or perhaps more specifically, customisation – largely stops. That’s because upgrades are no longer all immediately available for any car by default, like they are in Forza Motorsport 7 or Forza Horizon 5. Instead, they’re frugally rationed out for each car as you spend seat time in them and earn experience for that specific vehicle. They’re also no longer purchased with credits, either; rather, each car will have a set amount of ‘Car Points’ that applying upgrades eats away at. The amount of Car Points you have per car will be determined by each car’s individual level, which tops out at 50. Upgrades are always made available in the same order, but it takes several hours of driving to unlock things like engine swaps (40), body kits (45), and drivetrain swaps (50). By design, this overtly RPG-style approach is meant to encourage us to form more profound connections with a narrower assortment of cars that mean something to us personally instead of bouncing around. In practice, however, it’s just a bit bothersome. Sure, it never feels as trivial as, say, the luck-based upgrade systems under the hood of arcade racers like The Crew series or Need for Speed Payback; we’re still in control of the parts we choose to “purchase” and fit. And sure, at car level 50 with the full range of parts available, the upgrade system in Forza Motorsport is essentially the same as it’s been for generations. The problem is getting there is now an unexpected treadmill, for <i>every individual car</i> (including duplicates of the same car). I do appreciate Forza Motorsport’s “built, not bought” philosophy, but the new layer of gamification here isn’t really for me. It’s not so much the Car Point system itself – I actually think there’s a decent amount of merit in some kind of system that’s perhaps roughly analogous to time sunk. Anyone who’s ever spent time wrenching on a car will know that you can’t do everything at once, and Car Points <i>do</i> mean you have to slowly add and swap parts over time – just like in real-life. What I don’t really get is the concept of gating away upgrades in a strict order – especially the super straightforward ones. Why do we really need a certain car level before we can yank out the spare wheel to shave some kilos? It definitely dilutes the previous freedom we had to focus on the upgrades we predict would make the most meaningful difference to a car’s performance from the outset, and it’s all bit silly that I’m measuring fuel loads by the millilitre to slice bonus thousandths of a second off my lap times when I’m still lugging around a spare tyre in the boot. Fortunately, you will earn car levels anywhere you use them, whether that’s career mode, free play, or multiplayer, so you’re never spinning your wheels on progression as long as you’re driving. The career mode is made up of several tiers of themed racing events that are otherwise fairly typically categorised by car class for this type of racing sim. With compulsory practice sessions ahead of each race it takes quite a while to move through each tour, so I’ve been busy for a while and will continue to be for some time. The ability to select your specific place on the grid before each event may seem like a peculiar replacement for qualifying, but it does mean that you can have the exact racing experience you want each race. That is, if you want the old-school, Gran Turismo-style experience that’s more like an overtaking challenge than a race – where you’ll need to thread your car all the way to the front from the back of the pack in just a few laps – go for it. If you’re interested in faster AI and dogfighting all race for a single spot, that’s also possible. It’s a smart touch, and it’s a more robust single-player racing experience than the likes of GT7 as a result.  Microsoft pitched Forza Motorsport 7 as the ultimate automotive playset, and it’s hard to argue otherwise. With enough cars to fill a dozen museums and the most generous selection of tracks to date in the series, the amount of driving, experimenting, and racing here is absolutely mammoth. Accessible as always for beginners but crammed with content targeted at lifelong car junkies, Forza Motorsport 7 is Turn 10’s finest love letter to speed and style this generation, no matter what language you speak. <i>– Luke Reilly, September 30, 2017</i Read the full <a href=""/forza-7/5317/review/forza-motorsport-7-review"">Forza Motorsport 7 review.</a  That said, I have found the event intros are a little overblown; there’s a hushed reverence to them that car manufacturers probably love, but they’re pretty stiff and starchy compared with the more casual automotive culture shows I stream or watch on YouTube these days. There are also a few car categories that don’t seem to really get much of a run in the career mode, but I would expect the career mode to grow as this Forza Motorsport platform evolves. In the meantime, free play is still here – where you can do quick races in any of the 500 available cars – but again I’d really love some simple options to better curate what the AI drives against me. There are so many specific fields to edit to narrow down your opponent’s cars, but it’s all but impossible to get the 23 specific rival cars you want. Often it just ignores my custom settings entirely. Just let us place the AI in cars we choose, like Forza Motorsport 4 did. Forza Motorsport’s 500-car roster is slimmer than Forza Motorsport 7 and Forza Horizon 5 – both of which feature over 700 apiece – and, yes, there are probably conversations to be had. For instance, there’s been pruning when it comes to offroaders, and hot pick-ups like the GMC Syclone and the HSV Maloo appear to have been collateral damage. Lancia is MIA despite making a welcome return to Horizon 5 just last month. You could pick at the seams for some time. However, to be quite fair, Forza Motorsport does achieve this 500-car figure <i>without </i>the cheeky level of double, triple, and sometimes quadruple dipping some of its rivals do when it comes to counting certain models multiple times due to different paint jobs. It really still is an enviable roster of rides, all of which bark and crackle brilliantly thanks to some serious strides with the sound. Better still,<i> </i>there’s no shortcut to buy them with obscene amounts of real-world money: pay attention, Gran Turismo 7. They also look sharp and marvellous in motion. I played largely in Performance RT mode on Xbox Series X, which adds ray-traced reflections of other cars and nearby objects to the glossy surfaces of your vehicle at the cost of resolution (but not frame-rate, which never budged from 60fps). That said, I’ve probably missed out on a good portion of the visual feast here since I don’t typically play the Motorsport games in chase cam. If you favour 4K above all else, Performance mode drops ray-tracing during racing (and still runs at a resolute 60fps). A third mode packs in additional ray-tracing on other environmental objects but runs at 30fps. But hey, don’t scoff: so does Driveclub, and look how well the aesthetics of that have stood the test of time, even a decade later! It ultimately may come down to personal preference, and I don’t know whether overall Forza Motorsport quite has the measure of GT7, but damned if it doesn’t look particularly spectacular at midnight under heavy rain. Each of Forza Motorsport’s 20 track locations features support for dynamic time-of-day and variable weather, and they definitely have been dressed with more detail than ever before, with 3D crowds and more trackside objects and fixtures. It is a slimmer selection than the 30+ locations we had in Forza Motorsport 7, although it has been confirmed further tracks will be injected in the future for free. Yas Marina is coming back next month, another unannounced track will follow in December, and the famous Nurburgring Nordschleife will reportedly be ready by spring in the northern hemisphere, 2024. Still, no Bathurst right now? That Bath-<i>hurts</i>. Equally painful is the lack of two-player splitscreen, which is a mode my kids and I have traditionally had a massive soft spot for. They particularly love zany handicap races, like giving away massive head starts to ancient hatchbacks and then chasing them down in hypercars – which is precisely the kind of experimentation that sandbox racers with garages as exhaustively broad as Forza Motorsport is usually brilliant for. I presume splitscreen is simply a niche mode in 2023 and it probably comes at too high a performance cost on the Series S, but it really is a little gloomy whenever gaming seems to go backwards. Hell, Gran Turismo had splitscreen in 1997! The trade-off here is a massively improved online multiplayer component, with scheduled racing events packaged up as full race weekends, with a practice session, a three-lap qualifying blast, and a race. There’s spec racing, where all the cars are automatically tuned identically by Turn 10 for an even playing field, and open racing where you take your own builds. I’ve been playing the Touring Car and GT spec racing series over the past week and it’s been extremely robust and reliable, especially considering the pools of players I’ve been racing have largely been developers and other press located on the other side of Earth’s largest ocean. It’s a little hard to predict just how civilised it’ll remain after launch, but the safety rating should hopefully keep dirty racers away from clean ones. I also don’t think I’ve been on the receiving end of enough bad collisions to gauge just how effective the improved penalties are in actually disciplining the right players effectively, but I’ve had mostly great, clean races so far. Perhaps my favourite new touch from the multiplayer, though? The ability to skip to the end of a lap in the pre-race sessions (or when attacking times in the asynchronous Rivals mode). Messed up a corner? The Skip Lap option will respawn you on a flyer, just a few corners from the start line. It’s such a clever time saver. After six long years, Forza Motorsport is off the lift and back in our lives. It looks great, feels great, sounds great, and it’s brought with it the most impressive multiplayer we’ve seen in the series so far. With 500 cars and 20 track locations it’s hardly a small start but, now positioned as a platform, Forza Motorsport has the potential to expand into a seriously rich racing destination over the coming years. If Flight Simulator on four wheels is the plan, I’m here for it. First on the list of improvements Turn 10 should focus on is revamping the new RPG-inspired upgrade system that turns progression into an unnecessarily long road ahead of each individual car, and maybe bringing back the joys of split-screen multiplayer racing to complement the excellent online modes.

High On Life: High on Knife DLC ,6,"After nine months filled with dark and serious stories in games ranging from Diablo IV to Lies of P, I was more than a little eager to dive back into the stark contrast of stupidity and smut that is High on Life with the release of its first DLC: High on Knife. But while it certainly delivers the usual silly gags, amusingly gross and annoying characters, and some good laughs, that ride comes to an abrupt stop after only two hours, ending before I’d even fully settled back into a goofy world I’d desperately like to spend some more time in. Beyond that, the focus on Knifey, one of the more one-dimensional friends in your arsenal, doesn’t make for a particularly good story (even if he’s usually a reliable source of chuckles), and a lack of improvements to gunplay or performance are disappointing as well. I’m really glad that developer Squanch Games is making more High on Life adventures, but this brief second course doesn’t have nearly enough meat on the bones to justify dusting off my copy and reinstalling.   As you might expect, High on Knife focuses on the one-dimensional character Knifey: the homicidal, foul-mouthed Australian stabbing implement. He unexpectedly receives contact from the knife homeworld and forces you on a low-stakes quest to reunite him with his people. That brief odyssey takes you to Peroxis – a salt-covered desert planet that’s home to a species of extremely annoying and perpetually ill slugs who can’t seem to figure out what’s causing their health woes. Although there are plenty of enjoyable bits to be found on this barren world, it doesn’t make for the most cohesive story. Plus, hearing Knifey talk about how he wants to stab everyone and everything was a gag that already ran long in the base campaign, so doubling down on it here is a bit uninspired to say the least. Also, without going into spoilers, the whole journey ends in the most abrupt, unsatisfying, and uncharacteristically unfunny way possible. Speaking of which, that ending arrives a whole lot sooner than I expected, which is one of High on Knife’s major (and most literal) shortcomings. I reached the credits in a little over two hours, right as I thought the story was getting started. After arriving on Peroxis, you go on a handful of short quests before fighting one boss, and… that’s it. Don’t get me wrong, you can certainly spend more time than that talking to ridiculous characters, going on a handful of minor sidequests, and hunting for collectibles, but with just one new area to explore and very little story to keep me invested, there was precious little for me to be excited about. After looking under every rock I was able to find just five hours of stuff to do; Just when I was finally feeling comfortable back in this universe and with all the controls and combat mechanics after so long away from it, it was done. At least the credits, where Knifey just ruthlessly roasts the entire development team, are entertaining to watch. High on Life is an irreverent, absurd shooter that manages to shine with its outrageous humor, silly setting and story, and some really goofy, foul-mouthed guns that pull the whole thing together for the vast majority of the time. Combat is a bit sloppy, especially during the first act, and the whole sci-fi adventure sometimes has an unpolished feel to it, but once you get some new tools of destruction and movement options, it rises to the occasion. Not all of its jokes find their punchline, but with memorable boss fights, unique alt-fire abilities and exploration, and way more terrible movies to watch than I expected, this wacky journey is definitely worth your time. <i>– Travis Northup, December 15, 2022</i Read the full <a href=""/high-on-life/62629/review/high-on-life-review"">High On Life review</a The good news is that, although it’s far too thin, the stuff you’re doing is mostly the same ridiculous and amusing shenanigans for which this over-the-top universe is known. You’ll get coughed on by sick slugs, help a giant naked alien remove parasites from his butt, and invade a sort of space Amazon warehouse with even more questionable business practices than the earthly equivalent. There are some real highlights too, like one part where you can choose to partake in a parody episode of Cheers, complete with a probably illegal use of Frasier Crane for no reason at all. Some of the side quests are worthwhile too, like one where you have to collect gross Pokemon-like trading cards, then duel a nerd with them. When these moments hit, they reminded me why I enjoyed this dumb universe so much – it’s just so incredibly brief there’s not a whole lot to savor. The best part of High on Life has always been the guns, called Gatlians, who serve as your trustworthy companions, and that’s certainly still true. The additional dialogue and time spent with Gus, my beloved frog-like shotgun, and Creature, the socially awkward weirdo, were very much welcome, and make the sometimes lackluster shooting easier to look past. Unfortunately, the new guns aren’t all that interesting. For example, Harper, an ex-military gun with a dark past who replaces Kenny as the standard pistol, is a poor replacement – or at the very least, she wasn’t given enough time in the limited spotlight to really shine. Even worse, the biggest addition, called B.A.L.L., doesn’t do as much for me as a character – it’s a gun operated by a Blue Man Group-adjacent trio of three miniature aliens whose gibberish language can’t add anything to the conversation at all. Unlike every other weapon, it’s more fun to shoot than it is to listen to. Thankfully, the new weapons and abilities are definitely some of the highlights. B.A.L.L. turns the battlefield into a game of pinball, with a metal ball bouncing back and forth until it explodes for serious damage. You’re even able to deploy bumpers by using the weapon’s trick hole ability, which lets you automate and speed up the bouncing. Knifey also gains a new chainsaw ability in the second hour, which allows him to tear through environmental obstructions, carve his way through certain surfaces, and pull some sweet slide moves. Unfortunately, it ends so soon after you get that ability that there’s precious little room to actually play with it. High on Knife is a decent add-on for those searching for an excuse to jump back into Squanch Games’ gross world of naughty words and cartoon violence, but it doesn’t offer a whole lot of reasons to stick around for more than a couple of hours. With a disappointingly short questline and an ill-advised focus on some of the weaker members of the High on Life cast, it doesn’t come close to reaching the same highs (pun intended) as it did last year. There are certainly some decent laughs to be had, and more of this shamelessly idiotic world is by no means a bad thing, but there just isn’t enough here for me to be able to enthusiastically recommend anyone clear even this small amount of time on their busy gaming schedule.

Cocoon ,9,"Without a single word, Cocoon takes a small, cicada-like creature on an exciting journey through the cosmos using only a thumbstick and a single button. That setup should sound exceedingly familiar for fans of gameplay designer Jeppe Carlsen's previous work, Limbo and Inside. But here, Cocoon differentiates itself from those monumentally creepy side-scrolling adventures as a 3D puzzle-platformer, and the additional dimension provides a refreshing amount of, well, depth to its challenging and intriguing puzzles. These puzzles build on each other in smart ways, keeping fundamental mechanics from the desert at the very start integrated and important all the way to the end. And even as Cocoon gets more and more complex, its minimalist controls make sure it never feels overwhelming.   It’s not long before your cicada is unexpectedly whisked out of that barren starting area and into a harsh mechanical one, and it’s there you find your first orb – a mysterious orange sphere that somehow contains that entire previous desert world inside of it. You can pick this world up and carry it around, using it to power platforms, lifts, and other machines that impede your progress. Solving these puzzles as you swap between worlds is a wonderful time; seeing how each piece of the puzzle interacts with others and figuring out the layers between them is some of the most mesmerizing and engaging stuff I've seen in a while. And it’s dazzlingly beautiful. While Limbo and Inside both stuck with a simpler, more monochromatic tone, Cocoon breaks out of that mold with vibrant, curated color palettes. Each world has its own distinct color and vibe, from the warm sands of its first orange orb-world to the squishy and alien textures of the purple one later on.  As you progress through the relatively short five or six-hour story, the orb-worlds unveil special powers; revealing hidden paths, changing the state of objects between gaseous and solid, and other abilities that provide solutions to puzzles that were impossible before. It’s almost Metroidvania-like that way. Eventually, our little cicada friend is juggling and hopping between several of these different uniquely designed orb-worlds, with the only connection between them being the strange alien technology powering everything. Keeping track of each world's position and seeing how many layers deep you can place them almost feels like a dream; trying to remember where you placed the orange orb that's holding the white and green orbs while you're in the purple one can be a strange, almost mystifying experience sometimes. Each orb ends with a boss fight that's as unique as the world that contains it, providing a new final puzzle and challenge for step of the way. Every boss has a specific mechanic that's used to take them down, like a weakness to the explosives that grow nearby or trapping their legs in an amber-like substance. With only one button, the team at Geometric went above and beyond in designing some intense, engaging combat scenarios without sacrificing Cocoon's adventurous, curious feel. Puzzling out the patterns of the bosses takes the interactions you've learned with different objects and turns them upside down – carrying a ball and timing out when to cross a platform becomes holding an explosive flower and dodging the crystal structures one boss leaves in its path in an almost rhythm game-like fashion. Don't let those combat sections fool you, though; Cocoon is a puzzler through and through. With the orbs being both the worlds the levels are contained in and batteries for the technology within them, this is a game that’s ready to bend reality and challenge you in the best of ways. These puzzles are no joke, especially if you find yourself stuck – with little but trial and error, some of them can feel like you're retracing your steps over and over again as you try and swap between orbs one at a time. Eventually, though, the hints contained in the level design become clearer; a color-coded pathway will appear, or the rock formations in the distance will be covered in moss to give you a clue about which orb to use. But it’s not obvious, to the point where there were a couple times where I was convinced that I had somehow broken a puzzle by placing some objects in the wrong spot and sealing certain pathways off by doing so. Every time, though, I was able to find my way through before my patience ran out; sometimes, the spots where I felt way off course even ended up being vital solutions to the puzzle! A subtle bit of encouragement comes in the form of musical cues and triumphant swells that occur as you get closer and closer to the solution, cheering you on the whole time and adding to the feeling of discovery and accomplishment you feel once you finally crack the puzzle. Right before the repetition and feeling of walking the same paths back and forth starts to wear thin, Cocoon loops around from the verge of frustration to an almost Zen-like experience. You’re introduced to new and exciting concepts that eventually become natural and easy; what was once an entire solution is now barely even a piece of a much larger puzzle. The absence of any overt guidance as I made my way through this wordless story made it feel like the cicada is being compelled by some force, natural or otherwise, to complete its task.  All of this is this little guy’s role in the universe – even if we don't know exactly what we're doing, we're helping him push forward and discovering the larger meaning of these puzzles as we do. As things click together, it starts feeling like the times I figured out why an old boss of mine would have me do a bunch of seemingly pointless, disconnected tasks, only to find out later that each of those tasks was part of a project so large I couldn’t see the shape of it at the time. It's a strange feeling, but rewarding nonetheless. Later puzzles add layers to the complexity and the need to basically open your third eye to solve them. It’s not unlike the feeling of getting the hang of Portal, where suddenly there’s an entirely new way of thinking about what’s possible in a space. Once you start bouncing between each world, bringing one orb into another and using its abilities to trigger something you couldn't before, everything really starts to click; the depth of what's going on here is easy to miss, thanks to the simplified control scheme and deceptively uncomplicated art style, but the way you can seamlessly hop in and out of different worlds – and even place a world within a world in order to solve certain puzzles – is really something to behold.  Despite that layered and compounding challenge, Cocoon doesn't last very long at all – my first playthrough took a crisp five and a half hours, though it also contains plenty of replay value in finding the hidden Moon Ancestor collectibles tucked away in each world. Each of these collectibles are incredibly well hidden, but the feeling of intrigue I got while finding them (and the achievements you get for them) compelled me to find more whenever I could. Even though I wasn't able to find them all, the feeling of the few that I did find blew me away; I'll definitely be coming back to find the rest. Cocoon is a breathtaking puzzle-platformer that borders on psychedelic. Building on what made Inside designer Jeppe Carlsen's previous work stand out, Cocoon not only presents a mind-bending journey through the cosmos via fascinating worlds-within-worlds puzzle mechanics that beg you to delve another layer deeper, but an interesting take on the repetition of work, life, and being part of a ""bigger picture."" With a relatively short playtime and some well-hidden collectibles that make it worth replaying, Cocoon is a must-play for fans of Limbo or Inside, or anyone looking for a new puzzle adventure to play and then sit down and think about for a while.

EA Sports FC 24 ,7,"What’s in a name? When EA announced it would change the title of its premiere soccer series from FIFA to EA Sports FC24, we all wondered: is this also the year it finally takes a real step forward, out of the microtransaction-focused darkness and into the light of its full potential? Well, the answer is a resounding… kind of. There are breadcrumbs of greatness in EA Sports FC 24, with many new mechanics like Evolutions and Tactical Visions showing the series can evolve into something better. Yet, for every exciting improvement added in, there's still far too many of the same things, like poor AI, that have frustrated me for years.   For the first few hours of EA Sports FC 24, everything feels familiar gameplay-wise, for better and for worse. HyperMotion V and the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller feedback return make matches realistic, with precise ball and player physics, noticeable field wear and tear, and goal post-shaking haptics. It's hard to deny that there's a lot of attention to detail going into recreating a realistic soccer atmosphere. New overlays showcase useful statistics like shot volume and player fatigue mid-game, with numerous background interview segments laced throughout matchday's pre, mid, and post-game segments as well. While they don’t feature any actual interactions with players and interviewers, it’s one of the many noticeable bits of detail that add to the atmosphere. If you foul someone to set up a free kick, you’ll even get a neat little first-person setup from the ref’s perspective, just like you’d see during a live broadcast. At the same time, team walkouts and ceremonial songs have sadly been cut, replaced by a few different shots of either fans or players getting ready for game day. It's a shame that I can take a League Two side like Wrexham all the way to the Premier League and still not get to hear their glorious anthem or see them walk out during their debut on the grandest stage of them all. Unfortunately, the artificial intelligence part of the Hypermotion V technology that has been so heavily advertised doesn't live up to the hype. While Kinetic Shielding makes for some exciting battles, players still fall all over each other in unnatural ways. Advanced machine learning, which is pretty much a fancy way of saying constantly improving AI, is also hit-or-miss. Your goalkeepers will sometimes stand sideways and let an easy shot in or punch a ball that could have been caught, AI teammates make terrible attacking or defensive decisions that would have Harry Maguire blushing, and you'll likely find yourself yelling about an incorrect passing input more than once a match despite knowing you angled a perfect through ball with your sticks. It’s frustrating that these issues are still a part of the series, but there are changes that help ease the pain of dealing with them, most notably Playstyles. As the name suggests, Playstyles customize every player's method of play to fit their specific strengths and weaknesses. As a result, no two players control the same way, adding a fresh layer to gameplay and how you approach team management. It’s genuinely impressive how EA has managed to capture each player’s likeness, as you can bully opponents off the ball and rip through nets with Erling Haaland's Power Shot or finesse passes and set pieces with James Ward-Prowse’s Dead Ball approach. When creating your own customized player's Playstyle, you'll sift through 32 abilities spread across six categories: Shooting, Passing, Defending, Ball Control, Physical, and Goalkeeping. While it might seem simple at first, each one has a lot of unique sub-abilities to sort through that determine your character’s build, making a world of difference when it comes to tailoring your preset skills to work alongside your specific manner of play. Since I always create a Forward player that dominates the middle of the pitch, getting the Tiki Taka attribute makes controlling the middle of the pitch with quick passes to teammates a breeze, especially when coupled with First Touch, which makes getting and controlling the ball for the first time while under pressure more possible. With the ability to control the ball perfectly, my character can open up the field with wide through balls that get played right back into him or teammates to create a lot of chances on goal. FIFA 23 is a bombastic swan song for the series (under its current name, at least) with a welcome focus on theatrical flair. FUT Moments, action replays and viral-friendly gameplay revisions like Power Shots make it a more considered, memorable game of simulated football with intentional defending and plenty of drama and goals. But EA's Spartan approach to the modes that don't make money ensures FIFA 23 is an all-too-familiar beast to previous years, and Ultimate Team’s offensive focus on microtransactions continues to take much of the fun out of it. <i>– Jordan Oloman, September 30, 2022</i Read the full <a href=""/fifa-23/60543/review/fifa-23-review"">FIFA 23 review</a Alongside Playstyles, you can now go into the settings and turn on an option to control the direction of your passes and shots, replacing the previous Precision system. Shots are more on target while using the left stick to aim and general passes and lobs can be directed to exact locations. Mastering these techniques won't come without a bit of practice, but they open up the possibility of making creative runs, especially when working with other players.  Thankfully, the updated practice arena has more depth in EA Sports FC24 than it ever did in FIFA, adding in Scenarios that new players and veterans alike would be wise to check out. You can try out specific set pieces here, or nail down what Playstyle works best for you in drills or even full-on matches. Putting your pride aside and playing here to get the hang of the controlled shots and passes is worth it in the long run, as you can run experiments in a much quicker and more efficient manner than you’d be able to by playing full games thanks to the sheer amount of control you’re given. Once you've got your style nailed down, it's time to dive into the real reason EA Sports FC 24 is as popular as it is: its trading-card game mode, aka Sports Yu-Gi-Oh, aka FUT, aka Ultimate Team. As always, you'll need to go into Ultimate Team knowing full well that it always feels inherently unfair because people who are willing to spend real money on microtransactions to get packs will have a much better squad in a shorter amount of time than someone who doesn’t. The name of the game is still that quantity results in quality, and microtransactions pay for quantity. While it’s aggravating that grinding or paying the big bucks are still your only two options for significant progress, improvements elsewhere help deliver one of the best Ultimate Team experiences to date, even if you don’t pay. Evolutions in Ultimate Team allow you to take the base stats of cards and improve them by completing challenges, as long as they fit the criteria, which vary from stats like Overall, Pace, and Rarity. Manchester United lovers no longer have to wait to see Alexander Garnacho's potential fulfilled, taking him from a Left Wing 75 rating to a Relentless Winger 82 rating thanks to the Founders Evolution. To do this, you’ll simply complete objectives that are broken down into levels. Finish a group of requirements in a level, and you’ll get a stat boost reward. What’s nice is that completing these objectives isn’t as brutal as previous games in the series (yes, I’m talking about you, FUT 20), as most just ask you to complete matches with your EVO player. Getting to improve players you draw instead of just praying for a good pull is an enticing  incentive to play Ultimate Team for the long term.  Another leap forward for this mode is the addition of over 19,000 fully licensed players, 700 teams, and 30 leagues from the women’s soccer divisions to Ultimate Team; FIFA 23 only had 12 NWSL teams and four stadiums by comparison. EA Sports FC24 not only lets you play as everyone from Sam Keer to Kadidiatou Diani, but it makes men's and women's statistics equal. That means Nadine Kessler is able to body players off the ball the exact same way that Adama Traore can, making for some wild mixed-gender matchups and lineups. The other, often overlooked stepchild multiplayer mode in EA Sports FC 24, Volta, didn't change up too much, but it's the one I had the most fun with. Sure, there will be matches where someone is idle or is a complete ball hog, but the ones where you link up with compatible players bring back fond memories of FIFA Street. Few things are more satisfying than wall bouncing to a teammate who dekes around the keeper after a great build-up that leads to scoring multiple points. Since chemistry is so important, it’s recommended that you try and round up a solid squad of four friends if you want to get the most enjoyment and best results out of Volta. Stadium variety also adds quite a bit of variety to matches, with some featuring larger goals and others having higher walls to bounce the ball off. It’s a welcome bit of diversity to help prevent each game from feeling too repetitive. By comparison, the single-player focused Career Modes are a considerable letdown. Player journeys are once again riddled with a poor excuse for role-playing, with FIFA 23's Personality Points rearing their ugly head again. Honestly, I can't imagine anything screaming 'I love soccer' more than purchasing a Jetski to earn 50 “Maverick” points that will result in my player being a more aggressive shooter. The addition of Player Agents and Dynamic Moments show some potential to help flesh out the mode and make it a more fun RPG, but even those fail to stick the landing. While the idea of meeting certain goals via a Player Agent to get a transfer or renewed contract from your dream squad sounds nice in theory, some of the objectives are insane. You can have a Ballon d'Or, 60-plus goal season, and still be released from contract because you didn't hit five bicycle kicks in any of them. Yeah, sorry, Messi – we know you broke the record for most goals scored in a campaign, but we had to let you go because you didn't get enough Scorpion Kick goals as you were doing it. What? The whole thing sours what could have been a really great way to make up for the lack of being able to choose your own path and direction that has weighed down previous Career Modes. Dynamic moments also fail to capture the weight and gravity of situations fully, as you can only watch the same cutscene so many times before wondering where the story-based content of FIFA 17's Alex Hunter has gone.  Manager Mode is a little more interesting in EA Sports FC 24, mostly due to the seven tactical identities that your coach can apply to their club. Tactical Vision is what Playstyles are for an individual, just applied to a whole team instead. Pick the more defensive-minded Park the Bus option for a great defense, or use Tiki-Taka to control the middle of the field. I always prefer Wing Play, as nothing beats charging down the field and crossing it into an open net. Even then, there isn’t much that has changed in this Career Mode either, as single-player once again feels like an afterthought, cowering in the long shadow cast by Ultimate Teams. If you were hoping for a dramatic reinvention of EA’s soccer sim to go along with ditching the FIFA name, EA Sports FC 24 is not that. If you’ve played FIFA, you know exactly what kind of incremental improvements and longstanding problems with AI to expect this year. New mechanics like Evolutions show that EA has a general grasp of how to improve its RPG elements, even if it’s only currently for Ultimate Team where you have to put up with all of the dreaded microtransactions. Elsewhere, Volta mode is still a lot of fun with a full team of friends thanks in part to its unique arenas, while the Career Modes once again suffer from the same lack of care they’ve been missing for years, with the added annoyance of some ill-conceived RNG-based objectives this time. All told, it might have a new name, but EA Sports FC 24 is just about the same, frustrating but beautiful game. "
Super Bomberman R 2 ,7,"When it comes to arcade classics like Bomberman, the secret to longevity is keeping it simple. Though there have been dozens of iterations of Hudson Soft's absorbing competitive puzzler, they've all largely adhered to the same principle: blowing things (and people) up in a candy-colored paradise. Just about every one of them has a new gimmick waiting around the corner, whether it’s the spacious areas of action-flavored Bomberman Generation or Bomberman Tournament's Zelda-like Quest Mode. That's how Super Bomberman R 2 manages to keep the hits coming: with some clever modes that put a new spin on things. Of course, Bomberman has always been at its best when played with others, so it's no surprise that's where this feature-rich sequel shines in contrast to its repetitive single-player story mode and largely empty open world.   True to the format of the top-down, 2D original, the fun of Super Bomberman R 2’s multiplayer modes comes from throwing down explosives to blow up destructible obstacles while avoiding your own blasts and those of everybody else. When you aren't narrowly escaping an enemy's explosion, you're looking for ways to trick or trap them into walking into yours. As a result, you’re always forced to go on the offensive, constantly calculating where your next bomb is going to go, all the while keeping an eye on enemies who are doing the same. There are tons of ways to play with friends via local or online multiplayer, including the 64-player Battle 64 mode that has you fighting through a knock-down, drag-out battle royale. (Fortunately there’s crossplay, so there’s no trouble filling games.) It doesn’t jam 64 people on one map – that would be chaos – but rather takes a smarter, more manageable, tournament-style approach. You start out in a traditional four-player Bomberman match, while the other 56 combatants duke it out elsewhere in 16 other rooms simultaneously, much like the Switch’s now-defunct Super Mario 35. A timer counts down from 60 seconds, and when it hits zero, play areas are removed one by one. That leaves the last few players scrambling to survive, with one player being crowned victor. You can travel through the other boards during the Movement Phase to stay away from elimination zones, so it's smart to keep track of where everyone else is, too. It's humbling to finish dead last your first few rounds, but like any good battle royale, the drive to improve kept me coming back over and over again. Also new is Castle, an exciting and surprisingly strategic asymmetrical multiplayer mode that designates one Bomberman character as ""king"" and pits them against 15 other players. On the castle side, the king defends a number of treasure chests scattered throughout the stage by editing the map to their liking and setting traps and obstacles, and it’s fun to watch the attacking side try to get through it all. For example, gimmicks include parts like the Conveyor Belt, which can move players and bombs alike, and are meant to be part of enemy-stalling strategies. Weapons are simple but effective, with options like cannons that shoot bombs that can fly over walls, blades that you can plant to slash enemies in close proximity, lasers for long-range targets, and more. It may seem like a one-sided fight, but even when I was playing as one of the 15 attackers it can be difficult to suss out and capture all the treasure chests when you’re playing against a smart king. These matches are just as tense and unpredictable as Battle 64.  Another mode, Grand Prix, returns from Super Bomberman R: you and other players are divided into two teams to compete in four types of minigames. While they aren't drastically different from one another, each serves up a unique challenge that adapts familiar multiplayer rules like Capture the Flag. For instance, one mode has you competing to steal five ""Balloms"" from the other team to bring them back to your base. Crystals is just a race to see which team can collect the most crystals in a certain amount of time. If you don't feel like a lengthy Castle battle or want to spice things up beyond regular Bomberman matches, these quick Grand Prix rounds are a good alternative. On top of that there's a robust level editor (similar to what's available to the king in Castle mode) that you can use to make your own traditional Bomberman stages. Conceptually, it has a lot in common with Super Mario Maker, including the ability to share and download levels with others online by way of nine-digit level codes. Alternatively, you can browse what’s available until you see a level you like. In practice, unfortunately, the controls are cumbersome, making painstakingly placing each map detail block after block feel like a chore. For those who do decide to invest in some serious building time, there are absolutely brutal maps that can be crafted, as evidenced by my sifting through the maps already online and finding some real challenges. As with most online games these days, there’s a whole progression system to advance through, and moving up the ranks means earning currency to unlock fun character skins, player quotes, and more. Importantly, you’re racking up currency whether you’re playing online or offline modes, win or lose, and there are no real-money microtransactions at all – but it’d take a long, long time to earn everything. Super Bomberman R’s multiplayer versatility and boss-filled story mode are laudable retreads of classic gameplay, but its depth and customizability are disappointing. By contrast, the aforementioned Bomberman Live was a brilliant, fully featured Bomberman for Xbox 360 that came out 10 years ago, and it only cost $10. It’s reasonable to expect a bit more from a $50 Bomberman game in 2017. - <i>Ryan McCaffrey, May 2, 2017</i Read the full <a href=""/super-bomberman-r/1294/review/super-bomberman-r-review"">Super Bomberman R review</a There's a dizzying amount of customization options to choose from, including costumes from Konami games like Metal Gear, Castlevania, and even Silent Hill. Yes, you can have an adorable Pyramid Head to run around as. There are even a few references to classic Japanese dating sim Tokimeki Memorial, with an entire Shiori Fujisaki skin available. Since many of the costumes are more like brand new characters with their own abilities, movement speeds, and different bomb damage zones, it's worth racking up hours to earn your favorites. Others, like accessories and quotes as well as player badges, are just for you to spruce up your profile. Those are the reasons you’d want to play Super Bomberman R 2. The six-hour, four-world story mode, on the other hand, is not one of them. To be fair, it’s a considerable improvement on its predecessor’s campaign, but that isn’t saying much. True, it's twice as long and ditches linear arenas in favor of open-world exploration. However, these open areas are in no way comparable even to Bomberman 64's rudimentary RPG campaign; this one is little more than a tutorial for multiplayer. Bite-sized cutscenes with Bomberman and his rainbow-flavored pals move the largely forgettable plot along, but they at least explain why you're recruiting the cute little Ellons in each world to help solve puzzles and unlock new areas. Unfortunately, there isn’t much to see in each themed world beyond obstacles to destroy, simple puzzles to solve, and Ellons waiting to be rescued. And though cutscenes are heavily stylized with vibrant colors and fun character designs, the disappointingly basic and bland in-game environments and character models don’t follow suit. Luckily, the music is as good as it’s ever been, which at least helps make up for the confoundingly bad voice acting.  The occasional boss encounters break up some of the monotony, but it's back to drudgery after that. If your Bomberman is hit even once, whether by your own blast or an enemy’s, you lose all your collected Ellons following you in your current world. So whether you had two or five, you’ll have to go all the way back to your base to retrieve them. Sometimes it’s a trek to head back to your base after making all that progress. You’ll have to trudge through each monotonous maze once more, because some obstacles require a certain amount of Ellons for you to pass. All this backtracking only adds to the repetition, which means the story will likely wear thin long before you reach the end. Occasionally, you'll also see Castle mode within the story as well, which is an interesting twist. When you first start playing you're required to create your own stage with the level editor to be used as your HQ. Bots will take the role of human players, and if they steal all your treasure, you'll end up losing a life. So at least you’ll quickly get a lot of practice for multiplayer by completing the story. Super Bomberman R 2's extensive set of classically entertaining multiplayer modes, powerful but frustrating level editor, and fun customization options give you more than enough to do to make up for the dull story mode. Though it doesn't completely atone for its predecessor's throwaway plot, simplistic character models, and lack of content, it changes things up enough to court both new and old fans. With its large-scale Battle 64 battle royale and a new tower defense-inspired Castle mode, it’s worth playing for a few new spins on the age-old idea of blowing your friends up. "
Pokemon Scarlet and Violet: The Teal Mask DLC ,5,"It’s been almost a year since I reviewed Pokemon Scarlet and Violet at launch, and I still feel more conflicted about them than any other Pokemon game in all my years loving the series. They dazzled me with their open world design, which felt like the answer to years of fan requests – but the performance and aesthetic hits that came with that innovation were painful catches that didn’t quite feel worth the trade. Still, with two DLCs on the horizon, I had hope that Game Freak would be able to pull it together. Could the first DLC, The Teal Mask, fix Scarlet and Violet’s glaring issues and deliver a robust, new experience that fully embraced the clear potential of what these games could have been? Nope!!!  For starters, I don’t know how it’s possible, but somehow The Teal Mask runs worse than the base game of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet does. I complained about the poor performance of Scarlet and Violet in my initial review, and had hoped that a whole year later Game Freak would have made improvements to things like framerate, pop-in, weird lighting issues, model clipping, and everything else – problems <a href=""/pokemon-scarlet/61930/news/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-patch-arrives-as-nintendo-promises-to-take-tech-problems-seriously""><u>Nintendo even stated</u></a> it was working to address back in December. But it hasn’t. Instead, it feels like the DLC has the jankiness turned up about one or two more notches. It’s still playable: I didn’t run into any game breaking bugs. I did suffer from one hard crash, which while not a huge deal due to the game's frequent autosave, is still pretty shocking given the franchise's relatively polished history. But more importantly, during my playthrough of The Teal Mask it was impossible to go for more than a minute or two without a visual distraction. Maybe my Tinkaton was clipping through the ground during battle, or falling into the abyss when an encounter started on a cliffside. Maybe I was watching nearby Pokemon models vibrate violently, or seeing NPCs vanish in and out of existence. Or maybe the whole thing was just <i>chugging, </i>simply because I was riding on my Miraidon and it didn’t know how to handle more than a few trees appearing on screen at once. Look, I don’t expect high-fidelity graphics at the level of the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X in my Pokemon games. But the sheer amount of issues is <i>so distracting all the time</i> that it became an active detriment to my enjoyment. And if Game Freak keeps up its current pace of making performance several degrees worse with each game, by the next gen or so Pokemon might be literally unplayable, because you won’t be able to see anything. Fingers crossed that The Indigo Disk DLC this Winter improves matters <i>literally at all.</i I’ve been tearing my hair out for two weeks now over how conflicted I feel about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. The thing is, discovering and catching all these charming monsters across an enormous open world with an actually good story is really fun… it just comes with far, far too many asterisks. I truly believe that the bold new ideas of Scarlet and Violet are fantastic, if unrefined – a belief I also held about Pokémon Legends: Arceus. But in both cases, so many of the pillars holding up those shining concepts – visual quality, open-world details, customization, and technical soundness – are seemingly unfinished or actively crumbling. It is completely impossible to play Scarlet and Violet and not notice at least some of its performance issues. Every minute I was happily running around the grassy fields of Paldea I was also actively cringing at a Pokémon stuck in the floor, wincing at some weird framerate nonsense going on with a nearby wild Pokémon, or groaning at another bout of crippling lag. And the promising online co-op play that could be the start of an exciting new era for the series makes all these problems significantly worse. As a decades-long fan, I desperately want better for Pokémon, especially given how clear it is that the design fundamentals are absolutely there under the surface. But if you’re devoted to this series, as so many are, know that the proper care we’ve all come to expect has not been shown here. <i>– Rebekah Valentine, November 23, 2022</i a href=""/pokemon-scarlet/61745/review/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review-in-progress"">Read the full Pokemon Scarlet and Violet review.</a I don’t want to keep harping on the performance issues, but one more critical note on this point is that my problems with endgame raid battles from the original review <i>still haven’t been fixed, </i>which tangibly impacts gameplay. Queuing into online raids is still inconsistent due to the very weird way in which Scarlet and Violet refreshes its available raids and doesn’t notify you when they’re full. And once you do get in, completing high-level raids can be challenging due to lag and a weird timer system sometimes skipping your turn, freezing your screen, or otherwise making it impossible to tell what’s going on at any given moment. While some major raiding bugs have been fixed in the last year, it was impossible for me to spend time on the primary endgame content of Pokemon Scarlet and Violet or its DLC without running into this stuff and being frustrated by it. My feelings about the new Kitakami island region itself aren’t much fonder. Like Paldea, the world of Scarlet and Violet’s DLC is butt-ugly, with low-res textures, little detail in its environments, and a single town mostly made up of buildings you can’t enter and NPCs uttering boring, nothing phrases. That big local “festival” that the trailers hyped up? It’s just a few carts with vendors and some uninteresting NPCs. It’s even more of a disappointment when you consider that Kitakami is based on Japan – a nation that Game Freak has based multiple memorable regions off of before (Kanto and Johto). When I’ve already seen a Japanese-inspired world done in such loving detail in multiple Pokemon Games, Kitakami feels like a massive letdown.  That said, The Teal Mask isn’t all bad. The battling and competitive aspects are still what they’ve always been (good), and it’s still fun to fill up a PC box full of neat little dudes you find running around outside. The island checks all the boxes for that activity specifically: it’s big, full of Pokemon, and has lots of different biomes to poke around in. One of my favorite parts of Kitakami was the mountain at its center with crystalline pools at the summit, numerous caves along its path to the top, and a surprising cavern structure within full of Pokemon hiding around corners and in little holes. But the overall ugliness and performance issues did detract from locations that looked like they were probably quite beautiful in their concept art, just not their final execution – such as when I first laid eyes on those sparkling pools on the mountaintop, or when I crossed a thin, stone bridge to a mysterious cave as the sunset hit the surrounding rock formations. Content-wise, The Teal Mask largely consists of a familiar Pokemon formula where you track down a legendary Pokemon while learning about local lore. You’re accompanied on this quest by a sibling pair, Carmine and Kieran, both of whom spent most of the story alternating between yelling at me over nothing and challenging me to battles. The Teal Mask’s plot is so overdone that even a Slowpoke could see its twists coming, which is a pretty big bummer after the heights reached during the ending of Scarlet and Violet. This DLC campaign is also short, about seven or eight hours long, though catching every newly-added monster will stretch it a bit more. The best part of Teal Mask’s story is the subplot surrounding a photographer, Perrin, who sends you on a Pokemon Snap-esque photography journey after a totally different legendary Pokemon. After hours of Carmine and Kieran shouting at me, Perrin’s curiosity and backstory with photography were a refreshing change, and her photo-taking minigame provided a natural avenue for The Teal Mask to expand on something I loved in Scarlet and Violet: discovering Pokemon doing fun Pokemon things in their habitats. Frankly, Perrin’s story is so much more interesting than the rest of the DLC that it’s a shame I couldn’t spend more time hanging out with her and her Hisuian Growlithe instead of being dragged around by the world’s most unnecessarily angsty preteens. Other new features in The Teal Mask include an expanded Pokedex with a tiny handful of new monsters, a middling selection of new cosmetic choices, and a terrible minigame called “Ogre Oustin’” that involves tanking your framerate further by speeding around on your bike to collect berries really fast. While I’m always happy to praise Game Freak’s Pokemon designs (especially the candy apple-themed Dipplin – cute!), and it’s nice to finally change out of my hideous school uniform, I don’t know what they were thinking with Ogre Oustin’. It’s boring, repetitive, runs terribly (especially online), and yet made me feel bad about not wanting to play it by offering great rewards for anyone looking to build raiding or competitive teams. Terrible. The ways in which The Teal Mask feels like a step backward from what made Scarlet and Violet astonishing are also disappointing. Scarlet and Violet themselves promoted player freedom: you could go anywhere you wanted at almost any time, and do the major plot points in any order. The Teal Mask mysteriously tosses that in the bin in favor of a far more standard, linear journey. While you can explore any part of the island at any time, there’s no benefit to doing so beyond catching Pokemon. You can’t even do the initial quest – which involves visiting three sign boards around the island – in any order. The sudden loss of that player freedom is painful given how critical it was to my enjoyment of the base game. It’s also a surprisingly weak effort when compared to Game Freak’s previous DLC attempts in Pokemon Sword and Shield’s Isle of Armor and Crown Tundra. While both of these DLC were similarly criticized for being shallow in the story department, Isle of Armor added challenge by forcing you to train a brand new Pokemon, while Crown Tundra included multiple new game modes. The Teal Mask does… none of that, and feels distinctly incomplete. Maybe that’s because it was always meant to be just one half of a package with The Indigo Mask, but if that’s the case, then I question the wisdom of splitting the DLC at all. I just don’t know what to say anymore! I love Pokemon. I love catching monsters, and exploring, and filling a Pokedex, and harnessing the power of love, friendship, and adventure and all that. But The Teal Mask is yet another step in a slow quality downslide for this series: it runs terribly, looks ugly, feels predictable, doesn’t offer any of the freedom Scarlet and Violet’s main story did, and falls short in so many ways compared to just about every other Pokemon game and DLC I’ve played. If you’re considering The Teal Mask because you thought Scarlet and Violet were fun and just want more Pokemon, sure, this DLC will give you that. But as someone who was hoping The Teal Mask and a year of polish would turn things around for the ninth generation of Pokemon, I am sorely disappointed. "
Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty ,9,"Remember how many dildos were originally in <a href=""/cyberpunk-2077-pc/42052/review/cyberpunk-2077-review"">Cyberpunk 2077?</a> You couldn’t loot a corner in Night City without picking one up, to the point where CD Projekt Red actually had to patch a number of them out. Lootable dildos weren’t necessarily a problem on their own, but their abundance was a good example of how Cyberpunk’s grand story could occasionally clash with the cheap shock humor found around it. Phantom Liberty aims to right that dildo misalignment, and after some soul-searching, has seemingly found what kind of Cyberpunk story it wants to tell, and nails it. Balancing the punk-rock verve of Mike Pondsmith’s tabletop RPG with an exquisitely crafted spy story and best-in-class visuals, Phantom Liberty is Cyberpunk 2077 at its best. A quick detour: the backstories of Dogtown, Night City, and the whole Cyberpunk tabletop universe are heavily referenced in Phantom Liberty, to the point I had to look up lore guides to figure out exactly what was happening. It’s not so complicated that it’s impenetrable for the uninitiated, though, and CDPR does a good job of laying out the stakes clearly. But I imagine this stuff will appeal directly to fans of the tabletop game than inspired Cyberpunk 2077.  Phantom Liberty begins with the President of the NUS crash landing in a self-governed district of Night City called Dogtown, and you’re hired by her Secret Service detail to rescue her. From there you will meet the two most important new characters in the expansion, Song So-Mi, an NUSA hacker excellently played by Christine Minji Chang, and Solomon Reed, a sleeper agent who is brought back into commission portrayed by the <a href=""/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty/72842/video/idris-elba-reacts-to-cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-comments"">iconic Idris Elba</a>. Elba is again channeling his city-wise American accent from The Wire, only this time on the other side of the law. He’s definitely not phoning this role in either, delivering a thoroughly captivating performance as a secret agent who made me so desperately want to trust him even though he is Night City’s greatest spy, and therefore probably never telling the full truth. Phantom Liberty relies heavily on make-or-break decisions that can’t be taken back, and Reed is part of the reason why those choices become so difficult. Keanu Reeves also makes a return as Johnny Silverhand. Maybe it’s the years since I last played, but I feel Reeves is actually better this time around, performance-wise. Honestly, I think it’s that he has better material to work with in Phantom Liberty, which requires him to rattle off fewer diatribes about screwing over the system. Instead, the expanded story lets Reeves explore Silverhand’s mournful side, delving into his existence as a failed revolutionary imprisoned in someone else’s body. But more than that, between Elba, Reeves, and Chang, Phantom Liberty does a great job highlighting just how advanced its character animations are compared to some other big-budget RPGs. At the intersection of performance and technology, CDPR has found something in Cyberpunk 2077 that can genuinely move you. Just wait until you meet Reed’s spy associate, Alex. Overall, Phantom Liberty has a much firmer grasp on what kinds of stories can be told in Night City. It’s a metropolis full of political wheelings and dealings, all manner of crime, and more than its fair share of idiots, and that’s unique in the sci-fi hacker genre compared to the dour and operatic worlds of Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell. Cyberpunk 2077 is grunge and metal, and Phantom Liberty harnesses this wild energy into mature storytelling – something the outstanding animated Netflix show, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, also managed to capture. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners doesn’t overtake Cyberpunk 2077 so much as it expands upon it. But for the best version of Night City this side of the 21st century, consider diving into Studio Trigger’s madcap vision of the famous tabletop RPG. It’s a wild ride, but worth every blistering second, choom. <i>– Matt Kim, September 13, 2022</i Read the full <a href=""/cyberpunk-edgerunners/73118/video/cyberpunk-edgerunners-season-1-review"">Cyberpunk: Edgerunners review</a Elevated by Elba’s and Chang’s respective performances, Phantom Liberty hits all the things I love in a Cyberpunk story: it hones in on the hopelessness of hyper-capitalism and the dehumanizing effects of technology on our souls, all while using the spy motif to introduce some new themes to the world. How can we trust anyone when every element of the future has been so thoroughly taken over by automated forces of corporations and government? It has more to say than I expected going in, and more than I could have hoped for after my initial playthrough of Cyberpunk 2077. Similarly, CDPR gets a ton of mileage out of its spy premise. There are exciting moments where you’re channeling your best Ethan Hunt from <a href=""/mission-impossible-theater/67532/lists/how-to-watch-mission-impossible-movies-in-chronological-order"">Mission: Impossible</a>, complete with a new face to trick your targets, as well as an entire section that was very clearly inspired by <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/13/skyfall-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Skyfall</a>. I was curious to learn how an espionage plot could fit into Cyberpunk 2077’s story about varying levels of criminality – from the dingiest streets to the tallest executive corporate suite – but Phantom Liberty reminds us that the government, too, is part of our hyper-capitalist meat grinder, and not much separates a government agent from a streetwise fixer. It’s serious business, but whenever the storyline begins to feel too heavy you can take on side jobs for Mr. Hands, a fixer whose clientele ranges from kidnapped arms dealers to a doting resident who just wants to rescue her dumb-as-bricks fiance and his even dumber friend. But make no mistake: CDPR has played a wicked trick by infusing these side missions with the same kind of complex moral dilemmas you’re forced to resolve during the main campaign. What remains just as impressive as it was the first time I played Cyberpunk 2077 is Night City, which is still one of gaming’s great locations. The sense of awe at its scale hasn’t faded, and returning there after three years I find myself with the same level of admiration for CDPR’s grand work. Maybe even more so, given that Phantom Liberty adds an entire new district to the already-packed city. Sure, the idea of an independent Dogtown is a bit confusing if you’re not familiar with the lore, but this lawless Thunderdome proves to be a great setting for Phantom Liberty’s paranoid spy-thriller. This new area draws visual inspiration from both Las Vegas and Santa Monica: it’s part beach town, part luxury resort destination, with extravagant hotels, glamorous night clubs, and a football stadium that’s been converted into a city center. The line that “the location is also a character” has never been truer than it is here. There’s so much fun in wandering around Dogtown and discovering some hidden storyline or bit of environmental storytelling. It’s almost an anti-Tears of the Kingdom, where the joy isn’t in emergent bits of gameplay but in archaeologically uncovering secrets hidden throughout the area. There was always something magical about exploring Night City’s skyline, and doing it again knowing that no other game since has replicated this feat is just as impressive. This is one game I never want to fast-travel through. Without spoilers, there’s a specific point in the expansion’s story where it will diverge based on your decisions, leading you down one of two very distinct paths and endings. I played both for this review and found that one certainly feels more “canon” than the other. There’s also an entirely new ending that’s been added to the base game that feels like it might be the de facto true ending, and takes Phantom Liberty’s themes of self-sacrifice and near-future alienation and uses them to wrap up V and Silverhand’s story. I may start an entire new save to experience this story fully, from beginning to end. With all of the impressive changes in Cyberpunk 2077’s free 2.0 update that arrived alongside this DLC’s launch, <a href=""/cyberpunk-2077/73030/news/cd-projekt-red-says-you-should-start-a-new-cyberpunk-2077-save-after-big-20-update"">starting fresh is actually something I’m looking forward to</a>. On that note, while Phantom Liberty isn’t required to install the <a href=""/cyberpunk-2077/72221/news/cd-projekt-details-cyberpunk-2077s-revamped-police-system-coming-alongside-phantom-liberty"">2.0 update</a>, it’s hard to say that the revamped gameplay didn’t positively influence my experience as I played through 20 hours of Phantom Liberty. In particular, the newly reworked skill tree that makes it easier to build your character towards specific playstyles was a revelation. I had always wanted to play my character as a hacking netrunner, but in the 1.0 release in 2020, hacking was a pretty limp tool that let me do little more than distract enemies while waiting for a chance to shoot at them. With 2.0’s revamped cyberware system, I’m able to not only equip more cyberware at once, but the new skill tree makes it easier to enhance both my cybernetic and hacking abilities. I’m finally able to create a true netrunner character, someone capable of getting a group of enemies to point guns at each other if I want them to. Whether you’re pursuing a hacker build, augment-build, or something else, this alone makes Cyberpunk 2077 a much better experience than it was in 2020. To be clear, these are improvements that all Cyberpunk 2077 owners can experience even without buying Phantom Liberty. The expansion doesn’t include much in the way of exclusive abilities, but does feature some exclusive clothes and weapons. The weapons, in particular, are very much themed after the spy stories Phantom Liberty has taken inspiration from, giving us access to very fun, very powerful stealth tools that will let you infiltrate the deadliest den of thieves without getting caught. If you’re planning on coming back to Night City for another run, I cannot recommend enough that you take a detour to Dogtown while you’re here. Last year, I said in my review of Cyberpunk Edgerunners that CDPR now has a blueprint for where to go with Cyberpunk 2077, and Phantom Liberty shows the studio already had exactly that in mind. Between a more sophisticated level of storytelling with excellent performances, smarter insights on the cyberpunk genre and its dystopian themes, and landing on top of a much-improved gameplay experience thanks to its fresh 2.0 update, Phantom Liberty marks a new chapter for Cyberpunk 2077 and is finally close to what I’d hoped it would be when I first sat down to play three years ago.

Payday 3 ,7,"From the city street shootouts of <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/11/13/heat-blu-ray-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>Heat</u></a> to the creepy clown masks found in <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/06/30/the-dark-knight-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>The Dark Knight’s</u></a> opening moments, there’s something alarmingly alluring about the Hollywood bank heist fantasy. Fortunately, the excellent Payday series has been letting me live it out for myself for more than a decade without needing to establish a rap sheet. The next chapter in this long-running burglary simulator, Payday 3, has finally been released from custody, and though it continues the series’ tradition of delivering one of the best digital smash and grab experiences out there, the usual horrible Payday bugs, a dinky pool of jobs to tackle, and a predictably weak story mean it’s not exactly the giant leap forward I was hoping for. Still, if <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/13/payday-2-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>Payday 2’s</u></a> post-launch support is any indication, this is at least a very promising start for what could become another decade of happily pistol whipping cashiers and fixing drills. Like its predecessor, Payday 3 is a cooperative multiplayer FPS where you and three friends take on increasingly elaborate heists. The extremely thin story focuses on the same motley crew of criminals as they’re forced out of retirement by a secretive cabal of shadowy and generic silhouettes. All your favorite entrepreneurial personalities are back, including Hoxton, the chain smoking mastermind, and Chains, the always hilarious military man. Unfortunately, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the story itself is just a sequence of slides with voiceover justifying the string of jobs you’ll undertake with precious little to tie them together. There’s even a mission where you work with Ice-T… for some reason? (And yes, I do mean <i>that</i> Ice-T from all 500,000 episodes of Law &amp; Order.) Payday does love a good cameo, and though it definitely makes for an entertaining little encounter, it didn’t exactly do much to draw me into an already barebones tale. But even if the story never really takes off, it does do a good job at setting the stage while hinting at what that future might bring.  Within seconds of beginning my first robbery at the obligatory “local bank branch” intro level, the movement and gunplay already felt enormously upgraded. You move faster overall and can do more modern maneuvers like sliding, which I found useful in combat as well as for stealth. Weapons feel more punchy and satisfying, even if they are burdened with hopelessly small magazines and long reload times before you’ve spent some of your ill-gotten cash on upgrades. You can even use civilian hostages as a meat shield now, forcing enemies to engage you in melee to avoid hurting an innocent soul, which is a nice touch. After years of incremental updates to Payday 2, Payday 3 immediately feels like a proper sequel in the gameplay department, even if the formula of breaking into vaults and throwing bags of cash into an unmarked van remains identical. The weapon selection isn’t nearly as strong as Payday 2’s roster, with just 30 to pick from instead of more than one hundred, but the options available at present cover all the bases. You’ve got everything from deadly and accurate rifles to silenced pistols, and there’s a good mix of stealth focused gadgets and tools too, like throwing daggers that are perfect for sneaky tryhards, and devious jammers that can gunk up enemy comms. Weapons can also be customized with mods and attachments that significantly alter how they are used, like putting a scope on a weapon to increase its range, or adding a silencer to a giant rifle to make it an option during stealth runs. Payday 3 also raises the bar with the quality of its misadventures, as the vast majority of the eight available jobs are super well-designed. Many feel like instant classics, like the art museum heist, Under The Surphaze, with its delicate puzzles and labyrinthine halls hiding priceless art to be pilfered, or the fantastic Gold &amp; Shark bank heist that throws you into the most elaborate old fashioned vault break-in yet. Developer Starbreeze has definitely upped its game in terms of variety and quality with these base stages, and I found myself immediately repeating a completed job more often than not, just to practice my strategies and explore other possible outcomes. That said, there are still some weaker levels, like Road Rage, which is a combat-focused mission that has you guiding an armored van on a bridge with very little room for deploying different strategies and no stealth option whatsoever. Thankfully, that was the only one of the eight that was especially weak, and the highs of the good ones far outshine the lows of the less interesting choices. While almost all of the new heists are great, it is a bit disappointing that there are so few of them after such a long wait. Presumably that library will expand dramatically over time, just like the previous entry did, but after just five hours I’d already completed all the available jobs and had begun the endless grind of repeating those same gigs over and over again. The saving grace there is that repeating these missions is a lot less monotonous thanks to the variety granted by added stealth options that make most jobs feel like two separate levels in one thanks to how differently they play from run and gun playthroughs. In many ways the changes to Payday’s stealth mechanics are even more significant than any improvements to movement or combat. Only the most committed and elite players stood a chance of pulling off a totally clean heist in Payday 2, and proper leveling was basically a requirement in order to unlock things like a silent drill to get through vaults before making an attempt was even remotely viable. In contrast, Payday 3 provides new mechanics to support stealth right away, like the ability to pickpocket security guards to relieve them of their keycards, or use environmental objects to lure them away. That means pulling off a clandestine operation here is almost immediately achievable, even with a randomly matchmade group of players only loosely communicating with one another via text chat. That’s also largely owing to the clever and fantastic way its missions are designed, in which stealth runs are now given a completely different route to success. For example, the Secure Capital Bank level normally requires players to go the humdrum path of using thermite to burn through the top of the bank vault then dive in from the floor above before making off with the loot, but this series of objectives smartly only triggers as your primary path once players have been caught. Before that, your crew can take the much more complex and rewarding route of breaking into various parts of the bank to sabotage electrical systems and deactivate security measures to gain access to the vault without anyone being the wiser, which is essentially an entirely different mission if you can pull it off. In Payday 2, that same kind of bank heist required players to follow more or less the exact same path of drilling through the vault no matter your preferred tactic, and to do it stealthily you just had to not get caught. a href=""https://www.paydaythegame.com/payday3/faq/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>According to Payday 3’s FAQ</u></a>, real-money microtransactions will eventually be added in the form of “Payday Credits,” a premium currency used to unlock additional cosmetics. However, at the time of this review, these microtransactions are nowhere to be found, so we still don’t know if that premium currency will allow players to sneak around the existing system of cosmetic unlockables or just grant access to a whole new set of options. For now, I’m happy to see they aren’t a part of the Payday 3 ecosystem, which gives lots of reasons to grind activities and spend fake stolen cash on frivolous cosmetics, instead of spending real cash from our pockets. But all those new options don’t mean pulling off a stealth run is going to be easy, and that’s thanks to enhanced enemy AI across the board. Guards now respond to your actions, breaking free of their usual patrol routes to investigate suspicious activity and doing a whole lot more than drawing their gun and shooting you when you’re spotted. For example, if you’re found in a private but not entirely suspicious area, like the back office at a bank vs. the vault, instead of immediately trying to kill you, they’ll simply escort you to a public area and give you a good tongue lashing, which can be used by cunning players to remove guards from their posts temporarily. That smarter AI extends to combat as well, where the police do a great job of swarming you from all sides instead of standing around as target practice. They can also respond to your actions and try to obstruct your heist, like how they’ll pull the fire alarm when you’ve lit up that thermite, using the sprinkler system to delay your fire’s progress. Likewise, hostages are now much more responsive to your commands and easier to boss around and control as you use them as collateral in combat or negotiation. Which leads me to one of the most exciting changes to the heist formula: each job now has specific phases, meaning that instead of either being in unmasked stealth mode or chucking grenades around like a maniac, there are now defined moments in between those two extremes that allow for different parts of the crime fantasy to be more thoroughly explored. For example, the “Searching” phase triggers when you’ve caught the authorities’ suspicion in a minor way and they begin actively looking for you, but all hell hasn’t broken loose just yet, and the “Negotiation” phase begins if you ever get caught outright and gives you a window of time to lock the place down to prepare for a fight or play nice by releasing hostages to delay the authorities storming the place. This added nuance opens up some interesting new strategies, like hoarding as many hostages as possible to draw out the negotiation phase as long as you can. It certainly helps that zip ties required to keep hostages in line are no longer a limited resource, too, so you’re able to stack those poor bystanders as high as your heart desires. It’s also still a ton of fun to make your way down its role-based skill paths while out committing misdeeds, unlocking more abilities within those roles to bolster your preferred playstyle. That could be the The Hacker path, which turns your lawbreaker into a tech wizard who can hack into security cameras and confound security systems, or the Manipulator path, which grants you a silver tongue so you can intimidate civilians and law enforcement officials alike into submitting to your indomitable will. You can have any four of the 17 available roles equipped at a time and can spend your skill points within those however you like, which allows you to create the perfect villainous cocktail without wasting any cherished points on stuff you won’t use. It’s also nice that you level up and upgrade each of these roles by simply equipping them while out on crime sprees, which really rewards you for picking your knavery niche and sticking to it. Even though I’ve come around on this new, more streamlined upgrade system, I do still miss the depth of Payday 2’s progression. This new system checks the most important box by letting me curate my very own delinquent based on the role I want to play within the crew, but it’s also not quite as chunky or complex – and it’s particularly disappointing that Perk Decks have been done away with entirely. Perk Decks allowed you to round out your character with minor boons related to their background, which was a nice additional system on top of the skill trees that gave me another reason to grind. Here’s hoping something like that makes a return down the road. Hopefully that’s not the only update coming, either. As always seems to be the case with Payday, severe and horribly painful technical issues have returned like the cold sting of the law. Not only are the usual connectivity issues back, but there’s occasional framerate hitching, people walking backwards for no reason, and more. Even the menu barely works at times, and I’d often find it completely unresponsive as I spammed buttons before it finally noticed my all inputs at once and did insane things like open the same mission 15 times, triggering its intro dialogue to play all at once, overlapping in a incredibly disturbing way. I’m really hoping they iron this stuff out, but given that past entries have remained busted for months and years before finally becoming stable, there’s definitely cause for concern that we’re in for another rocky ride. At least when you’re booted back to lobbies due to connectivity issues, you can spend plenty of time customizing your character’s loadout. With lots of masks, paints, and trinkets to unlock, you’ll have plenty to chase and can waste quite a bit of time and in-game money customizing the color and patterns on your weapons or the suits your character wears when out committing grand larceny. Like everything else in Payday 3, it’s a fair bit thinner than Payday 2 for now, but there’s little doubt that will change with time as things are added, and in the meantime there’s still quite a bit to unlock. I will say though, I already miss the little card minigame that we got at the end of every mission in Payday 2, where you had a shot at unlocking the odd cosmetic or weapon mod. All those same things are now earned by leveling up and spending your stolen cash, but that dopamine hit when the match concluded is certainly lost here. Oh, and as always, the music in Payday 3 absolutely crushes it. Any disappointment I may feel when my stealth run fails is immediately forgiven once the beat drops and a money-crazed murder spree begins, making me feel like a complete badass instead of a heartless psychopath. This certainly isn’t new for the series, but it’s great to see they haven’t dropped that very important ball. Payday 3 is a solid step forward for my favorite heist simulator franchise, even though that step is a lot smaller than I’d hoped due to a lack of content and the unsurprising but still majorly annoying bugs and performance issues. The awesome combat, greatly improved AI, and especially the stealth options are so massive they alone justify this as a full sequel, and the new and improved heists with clear phases to navigate them are absolutely fantastic. I just wish there was more loot in the proverbial vault at the outset, and that Starbreeze would have used its years of experience in order to ensure this was a more robust and far more stable launch. I’m confident Payday 3 could become the sequel we all deserve with a year or two of updates – for now, it’s a nice start. "
Mortal Kombat 1 ,8,"If there was a Mount Rushmore for fighting games, you can be sure that either Scorpion, Sub-Zero, or Liu Kang’s face would be on that rock. For more than 30 years, Mortal Kombat has been ripping spines and severing heads, and the latest, Mortal Kombat 1, represents perhaps the most dramatic gameplay shift the series has ever seen. The new Kameo system offers an unparalleled level of player expression for the series, allowing you to essentially break the usual rules of the game by giving characters tools that they weren’t designed to have, resulting in a uniquely dynamic fighting system that allows for some truly wild combos and set ups. Everything built around that system apart from the predictably excellent story mode could’ve used some more polish and refinement, but even with those blemishes, Mortal Kombat 1 more than lives up to its gory legacy. If there’s one thing you can applaud Netherrealm for in recent years, it’s how each new Mortal Kombat game since MK9 has played dramatically different from the last without sacrificing that very distinct Mortal Kombat feel. So it’s not surprising that, even before we get to the crazy Kameo system, Mortal Kombat 1 makes some drastic changes from MK11 that really set it apart. For starters, it returns the meter management to just one meter that governs enhanced special moves, breakers, and now jump cancels out of uppercuts; fatal blows are still around, but are no longer invincible on start up; krushing blows are gone completely; character variations are gone; wake up attacks and wake up rolls are gone; every character is now able to do <i>much</i> more damage without even spending any meter thanks in part to a new air combo system; and thank the Lord, blocked crouching jabs are now punishable with crouching jabs of your own, making them much less spammable than before. These are all good, smart changes that make the action in MK1 feel fresh, yet familiar, while addressing some of the pain points that the fighting game community had developed with MK11.  The biggest new addition, though, is that Kameo system. For the first time in a Mortal Kombat game, you choose a second character that you can call upon as an assist during a fight. Your Kameo is governed by their own meter, and every time you call them in you use up half of it (or in some cases, like Goro’s powerful unblockable stomp assist, the whole thing). And it’s great that every Kameo has at least three assist moves, which adds multiple new tools to the repertoire of any character you choose to play. So, for example, let’s say I’m playing as Baraka, who notably does not have any overheads or lows in the middle of any of his combo strings. That would make him a character you can pretty safely just block low against. Unless… I add Scorpion as my Kameo character, who has an overhead as one of his moves. So now there’s an additional layer to my offense that I can use to try and open up my opponent in a way I wouldn’t have been able to before. Or I could pick Frost and use her low hitting freeze attack in neutral to try and catch my opponent off guard and start up a damaging combo.  Other Kameos can be used to extend combos that typically would not be extendable, convert respectable damage off of small hits that normally wouldn’t be convertible, and some even have more specialized uses. Maybe you give your character a teleport, or a way to become invulnerable to projectiles, or a way to quickly retreat to fullscreen distance. I’m not one who generally enjoys assists in fighting games, since they’re usually accompanied by tag systems and I’m more of a 1v1 fighting game fan, but their implementation here is extremely well thought out and does nothing but improve upon the already solid foundation that MK1 stands on. It’s a rare fighting game that hits just about every note as strongly as Mortal Kombat 11 does. Everything from its methodical and deep combat to its fantastically absurd story mode and its rock-solid netcode, right down to its extraordinarily comprehensive tutorial is absolutely exceptional. It’s only when you get into its drawn-out progression that it trips up: the keys to unlocking Mortal Kombat 11’s rich vault of customization options are locked behind the frustratingly gimmicky and grindy barriers of the Krypt and Towers of Time. This series continues to prove that there’s real fighting depth beyond its notoriously gory Fatalities, and this one in particular stands out as a spine-ripping good time. <i>- Mitchell Saltzman. April 22, 2019</i> strong>Rating: 9</strong Read our full <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/04/22/mortal-kombat-11-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mortal Kombat 11 Review</a That said, Mortal Kombat has always had a very particular feel to its gameplay - something that can be chalked up to the dial-a-combo system, having to hold a button to block, and some general stiffness in the movement – and the more I play other fighting games, the harder it gets to come back to. It’s stuff that I eventually got used to, but it took some time to gel with MK1’s unique style of 2D fighting. Once I did though, it was clear that Mortal Kombat 1’s actual combat is as strong as it's ever been. The story mode this time around is a true new beginning for the series, and that’s uniquely satisfying. This isn’t just a timeline reset like Mortal Kombat 9 – the entire history of Mortal Kombat has been re-written: familiar characters get brand-new looks, backstories, relationships, and powers. It picks up literal eons after the events of Mortal Kombat 11, in which newly minted Fire God Liu Kang used the Hourglass of Time to reshape the universe as he saw fit. Earthrealm is at peace, Outworld is ruled fairly by Queen Sindel, and while the Mortal Kombat tournament between realms still exists, it’s more of a tournament of pride and honor as opposed to a tool for realm invasion. Eventually that peace is threatened by outside forces that I won’t get into, but suffice to say, after a few very chill and lighthearted opening chapters with the supportive dad Fire God Liu Kang, cheering on his plucky new champions in their first martial arts tournament, things get very real very quick and the stakes get raised in all the usual ways. Above all, I loved seeing these new takes on classic kombatants, especially those who have historically been relegated to minor roles. Baraka and Reptile, for instance, never really got to be anything more than henchmen in previous games, but in Mortal Kombat 1 they’re major players with their own chapters and defining story moments. Plus, the writing is full of plenty of cheeky in-universe references that felt like nice rewards for being a longtime fan of the series. Netherrealm fighting games have always been the best at delivering story modes that are essentially the video game equivalent of absurd popcorn movies, and Mortal Kombat 1 is no exception to that rule. The campaign has no new gameplay innovations to offer, but its six hours are big, bombastic, well-acted, and ridiculous in all of the right ways. If that sounds familiar, it’s because I said virtually the same thing three years ago in my Mortal Kombat 11 review about <i>its</i> single-player story mode. And if I had reviewed Mortal Kombat X, Injustice 2, Injustice 1, Mortal Kombat 9, or Mortal Kombat vs DC Universe, I could’ve said the same for those as well. There seems to be an “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” philosophy at play with Neatherrealm’s designers, so if you liked those as much as I did, you’ll probably enjoy this one too. While I wouldn’t say anything needs outright <i>fixing</i>, there’s definitely some room for refinement that still hasn’t been capitalized on. Every chapter just throws you into the shoes of a new character without a hint of guidance on what’s special about them – what their combo strings are, their launchers, or their special moves, for instance. I had to learn on the fly by bringing up the move list, trying things out string by string, special move by special move, and by the time I’d finished achieving a base level of competency with a character, the chapter’s over and I’ve moved on to the next. This mode would benefit so greatly from optional, short, developer-led character guides that can get you up to speed on the fundamentals of a character before you have to spend the next 30 minutes playing as them – especially when its tutorials are so good outside of the story mode.  strong>Invaders of the Realms</strong Beyond the cinematic story mode, the big new single-player mode for Mortal Kombat 1 is Invasions, which combines the themed environments and rewards of The Krypt, some light RPG elements from older Konquest modes, and the quick back-to-back gimmicky battles of the Towers of Time, packaged in the form of a virtual game board. It’s a mishmash of ideas that sound good on paper but, unfortunately, tries to be a few too many things all at once. Here’s how it works: Almost every invasion “board” is made up of a series of spaces that each have a themed fight assigned to them, like a fight against Reptile on a space called “Look to La Luna,” or a fight against a super powered Kung Lao on a space marked “Kung Wow.” You move around the board conducting an exhausting grind of clearing repetitive battles against enemies that don’t put up much of a fight, collecting a slower-than-usual drip of worthwhile rewards, finding keys to unlock gates, and completing challenges like Test Your Might or survival minigames, until you reach the end. Along the way you might find themed towers where you must fight in a series of battles, with one loss sending you back to the bottom, or you could be ambushed in between spaces and have to fight a challenging opponent with unique modifiers. But even those are often pushovers. For the vast majority of encounters I went into auto pilot mode with Li Mei, doing the same launching combo that would be risky against a smarter opponent, regardless of who I was fighting or what the modifiers were, only occasionally being forced to consider the RPG elements in the chapter-ending boss battles that dramatically power up one of the kombatants in unique ways. Sure, there’s a lot of extra stuff going on underneath the hood in Invasion mode. Every character and Kameo has a damage type, with a complicated type advantage/disadvantage chart, there are talismans that can be upgraded to provide a variety of different status bonuses, and relics that frequently come with both a positive and a negative bonus to weigh against each other. But that’s all just a lot of complexity that doesn’t really add any value to the actual gameplay. Late game boards up the difficulty and force you to engage more with the RPG mechanics, but that’s not much more fun either, since Mortal Kombat 1 is at its best when there are no gimmicks involved. I’m happy to have the option to play the occasional silly match with wild modifiers and themed challenges, but Invasions strings too many of these fights together and expects you to play through them all in order to unlock many of the best cosmetic options for its characters. That turns it into a chore. However, one thing that MK1 does get right is that the more you play with a character, the more you unlock for that specific character. And there is a <i>ton</i> to unlock for everybody. There’s new gear, skins, taunts, brutalities, and even fatalities that come with every level up. Granted, you’ll probably be able to find the input command for the locked fatalities before you unlock the in-game instructions if you search online, but nonetheless, you’re rewarded well for maxing out a character’s progression track. One aspect that Mortal Kombat 1 does better than just about any other fighting game out there right now is its tutorial. It continues to build upon the great work done in Mortal Kombat 11, expertly explaining everything from the most basic controls to intuitive breakdowns of system mechanics, to highly practical tips that outright explain in detail how to approach pressuring your opponent, what to do when they’re knocked down, how to frame trap, how to jail, what all of those things mean, and plenty more. It’s the kind of comprehensive tutorial that all fighting game developers should include, and all fighting game fans should play all the way through. I do wish that same level of commitment was also applied to character specific tutorials, but there are seven combo trials for each character at least, which is nice to have. On the subject of online, it's mostly unchanged from Mortal Kombat 11, for better and for worse. The netcode is good, King of the Hill is back, and Kombat League returns with seasonal rewards for achieving high ranks in the form of currencies, skins, gear, profile pictures and more. It remains a great ranking system, one that generally succeeds at matching you with appropriate fighters and rewards your investment with unique prizes that are worthwhile because they mean something more than just a skin you got from a random chest pull. That said, it’s still incredibly frustrating that Mortal Kombat 1 does not let you matchmake while in another mode. Mortal Kombat is pretty much the only major modern fighting game franchise now that doesn’t let you do this. Not only that, but there’s no way to create a custom room with multiple slots for multiple matches to go on simultaneously, and when you join in on a match in progress, you have to wait for the match to finish and just stare at a blank screen. This might have been fine back in 2019, but the bar has been raised, and Netherrealm feels like they’re getting left behind by the competition. Crossplay is coming down the line, but it’s also disappointing that it’s not available right out of the gate. One thing that can’t be overstated is how gorgeous Mortal Kombat 1 looks. The character models already looked incredible in Mortal Kombat 11, but here they’re taken a step even further towards photorealism without ever causing that uncanny valley feeling. The real star though are the stages — the environmental team at Netherrealm has truly outdone itself with some of the most gorgeous vistas and disgusting looking dungeons the genre has ever seen. Not to mention <a href=""https://www.ign.com/wikis/mortal-kombat-1/List_of_Fatalities_-_All_Button_Inputs_and_Codes"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">those fatalities</a>, which are extra gruesome this time around. All of the usual microtransactions that we’ve come to expect from Mortal Kombat are here in MK1. There’s a store with rotating premium cosmetics, which are bought with a premium currency that can be bought with real world money (though you do get a substantial amount from beating the campaign). Frustratingly, you can only buy them in bundles, but the cheapest bundle is only enough to buy a single piece of gear, not a premium bundle with a unique skin. And then of course there’s the upcoming season pass which will include Quan Chi and Ermac, along with amoral guest characters Peacemaker, Homelander, and Omni Man. On the plus side, the Invasions mode itself is microtransaction free. There’s no pay-to-win, there are new boards to play every season, and there are also daily and weekly towers that cycle in just like they did with the Towers of Time in MK11, all at no extra cost. That means if you do enjoy Invasions and its gimmicky battles and RPG elements, there will always be something to play.  Mortal Kombat 1 is another great entry in this legendary series, but it’s not one without issues. The new Kameo system is excellent, there are smart changes to the fighting mechanics that address many of the fundamental issues that cropped up over  Mortal Kombat 11’s life, and predictably, the fantastic single-player story mode that continues to be the gold standard of the genre. But certain elements of online play are starting to feel dated, and Invasions mode is not nearly engaging enough to hold my attention for as long as is needed to unlock a majority of the goodies hidden behind its many treasure chests and gimmicky battles. Still, Mortal Kombat 1 marks a new beginning for the franchise, and it’s a very exciting launching point for the next era. "
Party Animals ,7,"With Party Animals, developer Recreate Games takes the goofy joy of floppy, physics-based multiplayer games like Fall Guys, Gang Beasts, and Human: Fall Flat and puts its own spin on them. Instead of falling in with the rank and file, Party Animals pushes the genre forward thanks to a thoughtful attention to detail, creative levels, and its engaging, comedic showdowns, though it does stumble over its inflexible rules and local multiplayer mishaps.   You’ll take control of an adorable, clumsy animal with a powerful right hook as you join up to seven other players in punching, dropkicking, headbutting, and flopping your way to victory in a variety of different challenges. Their wobbly animations cause a sticky, moving-through-molasses-like feel to the controls that might be a turn-off at first, but after a few rounds it clicks. Doing just about anything – including walking – has a short wind-up, but the delay eventually becomes satisfying as you watch your party animal launch itself into motion. It feels intentional, and contributes to Party Animals’ overall loose sense of combative chaos. Attacks all have a similarly long wind-up that contributes to the ragdoll nature of your chosen combatant, but when a blow connects, it feels less like a plush pawing from a stuffed animal and more like a powerful pound from a heavyweight boxer. Time even temporarily slows down to really emphasize the impact of a particularly potent punch before your cute little guy goes flying. With three modes, each with its own set of maps, there’s a lot to sink your teeth into here. The main one is Last Stand, which distills Party Animals to its purest, most chaotic form. Each of the nine maps feels relatively small, but they are perfectly sized to house eight-player, every-animal-for-themselves bedlam. They all present you with distinct, clever environmental challenges to overcome and/or throw your opponent into, from a cracking ice float to a high-speed wind tunnel. Weapons appear in all three modes but are most useful in Last Stand because here KOs are prioritized above all else.  Those weapons include giant lollipops, crossbows, tasers, nunchucks, and toilet plungers among others, and they rain down from the sky to help whichever lucky animal picks them up wreak even more havoc. My favorites are the bomb, which can be lit and tossed into the middle of a cluster of critters like something right out of a Looney Toons cartoon, and the nunchucks, which are a chaotic pickup that deals heavy damage very quickly but might also smack you in the face. As players get whittled away things can start to slow down, but most of Last Stand’s maps ensure that rounds never drag on much longer than three or four minutes on average, as it becomes more difficult to survive as time stretches on. Maybe the rope bridge you’re fighting on suddenly falls sideways, or perhaps the levers that you use to defend yourself from a wild tunnel’s gale snap off, leaving you to get swept away. True, it’s a drag to be KO’d early and have to spectate until the next match, but you can fling increasingly powerful items like fish, banana peels, and bombs onto the battlefield after getting knocked out, which keeps everyone engaged. On a few occasions, I’ve even seen a projectile from a knocked-out player determine the outcome of an entire match. The second mode, Team Score, splits its eight maps in half. Four are variations on different sports like basketball, soccer, hockey, and American football. They’re all fun party modes, but they’re not particularly interesting or novel. The non-sports maps, on the other hand, all come with their own unique mechanics that run the gamut of playstyles. In one, you have to carry big chunks of coal to the front of a train to push your team’s locomotive ahead of the other. In another, you’ll launch explosives (and your teammates) across a river into your opponents’ base. Most of them also allow you to sabotage your opponents, adding a welcome layer of chaos to the competition that keeps you from falling into a repetitive rut. Almost every single map introduces new ways to reward you for understanding Party Animals’ floppy controls without leaving new or unskilled players in the dust. Finally there’s Arcade Mode, which is entertaining, but is overshadowed by the others thanks to its relatively small list of just two maps. It’s also very similar to Last Stand; the levels in both modes feature similar mechanics and design philosophies while avoiding the custom-built challenges and objectives found in Team Score. The only real difference is that Arcade puts you into two teams of four with 10 lives shared between them. That similarity is a little disappointing, but Arcade Mode does have my favorite map in Party Animals: Final Destination, where you’re fighting for control of a subway platform. Throwing your opponent down onto the tracks before a train comes is really fun and makes for some tense moments.  It’s so amusing, in fact, it makes me wish I could play it more consistently or in other modes! But because Arcade Mode only makes up two of the 20 total maps in Party Animals, the online matchmaking that seems to pull randomly from the overall pool causes it to come up a lot less often than Last Stand and Team Score. It would be nice if Party Animals included a playlist system that let players opt into whichever modes or maps they like the most. One thing that sets Party Animals apart from other similar games is that it supports up to eight players, but that bigger scope can also kill a small party’s vibe; while I spent the majority of my time playing in full lobbies, playing with smaller groups uncovered some confusing rigidity beneath the surface. Where other party games have dozens of options to customize rules like item spawn rate and score limits, Party Animals does not. It’s missing the elasticity that makes a great party game replayable for years on end.  This problem is at its worst in Team Score mode, where you can’t modify things like score limits or the arbitrary timer that pops up whenever a team goes a certain amount of time without scoring a point. Playing with people who don’t follow a map’s specific objective or who aren’t familiar with Party Animals’ controls will result in matches that drag on because each map and game mode is designed in very narrow ways that don’t accommodate doing something the developers didn’t necessarily expect. Local Multiplayer is similarly stymied by some eyebrow-raising decisions. Mainly, you’re forced into four-way split-screen (causing frame rate slowdowns on my PC) with a clumsy camera when it seems as though a fixed view of the whole map would work better. I felt discouraged from playing locally with my roommates or inviting friends over to play a few rounds rather than just playing with them online. In 2023, it’s frustratingly common for a party game to force local multiplayer into the backseat – here it’s even hidden within the online multiplayer menu – but it is always disappointing. These issues, though minor, point to where Party Animals needs some post-launch love and care. I could very easily see a patch or update fixing a majority of them, and it seems like Recreate Games at least intends to support this fluffy mayhem for some time to come. For example, there’s a full item shop where you can spend in-game currency, a progression system, and a locker system that you might expect from a live-service game.  It’s impossible to bring up Party Animals’ item shop without gushing about the adorable cosmetics you can unlock. Almost every character has a variety of cute costumes that range from cheeky nods to pop culture, like an aviator jacket for a goose, to just plain charming digs that make a tiger look like a champion fighter. They don’t change gameplay whatsoever, they’re just there to look cute.  The version I played had everything unlocked already, but you’ll need to earn in-game currencies to unlock a legally distinct Darth Vader lookalike costume for your duck or a samurai costume for the Shiba Inu. It’s hard to say for sure ahead of launch, but between the Fortnite-like shop and the ways Party Animals’ multiple currencies are displayed, I have a feeling you’ll be able to buy in-game currency if you’d like to unlock a specific costume. (There’s also a blind capsule machine where you can buy random items.) That’s largely par for the course in a modern multiplayer game, but at least here you do earn currency, skins, and opportunities to use the capsule machine as you play. With smooth online multiplayer, a handful of mostly distinct maps, and downright adorable characters, Party Animals delivers a fun party game that brings cuddly, chaotic fun where it counts the most. The intentionally wobbly controls take a moment to get used to, but once you do it’s wonderfully satisfying to land a punch and send another player flying into an environmental hazard for a KO. It does commit an all-too-common cardinal sin for contemporary multiplayer games in making local play less enjoyable than going online, but all three main modes are a good time, especially in a full lobby of eight players. "
The Crew Motorfest ,7,"Not many things are better the smaller they get. Mortgages? Certainly. Golf scores? Sure. Kidney stones? Okay, yes. But video games? That’s more of a grey area. For The Crew Motorfest, developer Ivory Tower has chosen to give its chunky interpretation of the entire continental USA the chop in favour of something far more concise: a scaled-down riff of the single island of O’ahu, Hawaii. The result is better in some ways and worse in others, but overall it’s actually an experience that sometimes feels like it’s trying harder to emulate Forza Horizon than its own predecessors. I can’t say I blame them considering how much I loved Horizon 5, and they’ve done a good enough job at it that I’ve had many great moments in Motorfest over the past several days. It has the best handling in the series so far, and it does boast some incredibly strong lighting. However, while Motorfest is a mostly earnest romp for car lovers in a vibrant, tropical paradise, it definitely loses some momentum due to its confusingly dead world and slightly uneven campaign, and its omnipresent, baked-in microtransactions are a constant bugbear. After its handbrake turn from an illegal, underground street racer in the 2014 original to the sanctioned motorsport TV show format of The Crew 2 in 2018, The Crew Motorfest has peeled away in yet another new direction: that is, it’s now based around a bustling summer car culture festival. Let’s admit it’s not exactly original, though: the Forza Horizon series has had this patch accounted for since 2012.  However, it really does get off to a very positive start, with a confident and well-curated prologue segment that gives us an effective taste of Motorfest’s varied racing action and – immediately after that – the freedom to head out into O’ahu to tackle the large pile of events in essentially whatever order we choose. Admittedly, Motorfest has far, far less real estate to race on than The Crew or The Crew 2. You can drive all the way around the island in a little over 15 minutes; in The Crew 2 it takes around 40 to 60 minutes to drive from one side of the map to the other. However, the narrower focus <i>has </i>resulted in a map that’s more handsome and densely detailed (and, while it lacks the same ambitious scope, it doesn’t seem to be plagued by nonsensical, procedurally generated storefronts selling chicken-grilled coffee). I do miss the sheer variety of vistas and landmarks of The Crew 2 but there are moments – particularly during sunsets – where it looks quite exceptional, although there are also times where low flying reveals some pretty egregious vegetation and shadow pop-in. It’s at its worst hedge hopping over the centre of the island. Overall, the map is a little dead, though. There are no people on the streets, and traffic is extremely light. Motorfest tries to add zest by tossing in AI racers that spawn in suddenly and dart through the streets around us, but it actually just makes the free-roam driving occasionally frustrating. Traffic cars can be collided with, but AI cars and other racers can be ghosted through. Unfortunately, it’s not always instantly clear which is which at 400 kilometres per hour. Motorfest does have a better approach to trackside smashables than The Crew 2, though, and far fewer of them will completely stop us dead. Motorfest splits its campaign into a series of themed Playlists, each drilling down on either a particular car type, driving style, or other aspect of auto culture. For instance, one Playlist focuses on Japanese custom shop Liberty Walk. The voiceover work here is a little stern but it’s a cool and occasionally educational showcase of some heavily customised cars. Another highlights the history of the 911, which is a clever way to make use of several generations of the iconic Porsche that Motorfest has at its disposal. My favourite so far is definitely the Donut Media Playlist, which is mostly a series of fun showdowns between famous rival vehicles. Known for their automotive apparel and YouTube content, Donut has already had a couple of collaborations with Forza Horizon 5 prior to its appearance in Motorfest – but the addition of hosted vignettes before each race here injects a little more of Donut’s madcap approach to motoring, and I actually found their Motorfest appearance the more entertaining of the two. Not every Playlist has landed for me, though. For instance, I’m quite disappointed in the drifting Playlist. The first few events are passable, although I don’t love that they’re hosted on huge and unrealistic raised structures – including one that coils into the sky like a giant spring. The next few actually resemble real-world drifting on twisting mountain roads, but then it just loses the plot completely and throws us into several traditional races. The pretext is that you’re supposed to discover whether a drift car can beat street cars in a conventional street race, but the upshot is… we’re driving to be as quick as possible and not to look as cool as possible. It’s essentially the opposite of drifting. Why these events constitute the whole crescendo of the drifting Playlist is anyone’s guess. I’m also doubly disappointed that Motorfest’s boat and plane events have been lumped together into a single Playlist that largely feels like an afterthought. Like The Crew 2 before it, the water effects in Motorfest are genuinely great and racing through huge swells is chaotic fun – but there are far fewer boat events in Motorfest than there are in The Crew 2. Aircraft events are again mundane races against the clock, and the planes are still woefully slow. Motorfest adds a Grumman F8F Bearcat to its hangar – literally one of the fastest piston-engine aircraft of its era – but it’s barely capable of a third of its real top speed in Motorfest. Thanks to this, flying feels mostly dull – and it’s not helped by the fact the default flight model is absolutely awful. For reference, there’s an aircraft handling assist that automatically locks some of the flight axes, but the flying feels infinitely better with it toggled off (I’d recommend using the chase camera that rolls with the wings – not the one locked to the horizon).  The Crew 2 is big, confident, and stuffed with arcade racing action – land, sea, and air. There’s undoubtedly something still charming about a racing game that lets us drive an F1 car across the Golden Gate bridge, fly a Spitfire through the Grand Canyon, and crash a monster truck through Central Park, but its uneven presentation, lack of events that use its best features, and absent PvP is a bummer. <i>– Luke Reilly, June 29, 2018</i Read the full <a href=""/the-crew-2/16469/review/the-crew-2-review"">The Crew 2 review</a I can anticipate some resistance to Motorfest’s strict focus on its Playlist approach, and I will concede it does seem odd to have us agonise over choosing a free starter car that basically functions as a taxi to take us to events we’ll complete in preordained “loaner” cars. In fact, our personal cars are mostly irrelevant until a Playlist is complete, at which point we can redo races in the cars of our choice. I don’t really mind this format; I just can’t really bear the constant babble of Motorfest’s so-called AI assistant anymore. She certainly mispronounces a lot of words. The Groo-man Bearcat? Cred-ough? Diss-plin? Are we just saying typos out loud now? I’m a little exhausted with the fact that effective fast travel is locked behind the completion of 10 Playlists. I'm also cynical about why some Playlists can be completed without owning any prerequisite vehicles, and some require arbitrary and expensive in-game purchases. It’s especially galling when, even after you buy a required vehicle, Motorfest literally still “loans” you a duplicate of the car you just purchased to complete the event in anyway. As with The Crew and The Crew 2, Motorfest is still pretty stingy when it comes to payouts, and it’s endlessly tedious how Motorfest’s virtual currency is only ever a button-press away. You could spend a lot of money instantly unlocking all of the vehicles in Motorfest – Ivory Tower quotes a figure of 600+ – but in reality that’s a blatant exaggeration. Yes, there are plenty of genuinely great cars here, but the final figure is bolstered significantly by counting multiple versions of the same car several times over simply because they have fancy nicknames and some stickers spackled on them. Piles of these are also just reward cars from The Crew 2 that can’t actually be accessed unless you already own them there, so 600 cars just isn’t an accurate or meaningful figure for a new Motorfest player. Sure, 13 Mitsubishi models sounds like a extensive assortment, but they’re mostly doubles. The Evo X is doubled again, so a quarter of them are the same car. That said, the vehicles are highly detailed – except for the Vaseline-smeared and completely functionless mirrors – and they generally look and sound great. More importantly, I find the cars <i>feel</i> noticeably better in Motorfest than they did in The Crew 2. Put simply, there’s a much-improved sense of weight and grip, especially when flicking a car quickly from side to side to break the rear end loose. The cars come alive in corners with traction control off, but I dislike how having the driving aids off appears to be a decent advantage for our AI opponents, who seem to get a perfect launch at the start of every race. I eventually relented and opted for some mild TCS to try to level the playing field. If you want my advice, turn on the driving aids when racing online, too. Trying to keep up with other human players in the island-spanning Grand Races in Motorfest’s most-mental hypercars simply isn’t worth the effort without some traction assistance. That said, I doubt I’ll get much mileage out of the multiplayer, as even getting a race has been taking as long as the events themselves. Sitting in a lobby for 10 minutes waiting for at least 14 people to show up isn’t fun. Why can’t we register for a Grand Race and continue to drive around until enough players are on board to trigger it? Multiplayer isn’t the only thing I’ve bounced off in Motorfest, either. I’ve never liked The Crew’s loot-based upgrade system and I never will, and grinding for legendary gold parts isn’t on my agenda (and nor is buying them outright for real-world money). It’s said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. LEGO has Mega Bloks. E.T. has Mac and Me. Now Forza Horizon has The Crew Motorfest. To be fair, Motorfest is a robust racer with a confident sense of style, a quality arcade handling model, and a long list of generally well-planned events right out of the box. However, the shift to a smaller map has seen it lose a part of its old identity, boats and aircraft feel like they’ve been sidelined, and some of its event Playlists work a lot better than others. Ultimately, The Crew Motorfest is a little more Ice Ice Baby and a little less Under Pressure. It’s a catchy enough copy, but it ain’t exactly back with a brand new invention. "
Lies of P ,8,"You know we’ve entered a new era in the increasingly crowded <a href=""/elden-ring/63993/opinion/why-fromsoftware-is-still-king-of-the-soulslike"">soulslike</a> arms race when we’re now turning classic children’s stories into dark, twisted <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/bloodborne-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bloodborne</a> pseudo-sequels, but hey: here we are. Yes, Lies of P is yet another game inspired by the dark and unforgiving FromSoftware masterpieces that have captured the hearts of so many (myself included), but it’s also an undeniably impressive standout amid a sea of games chasing the soulslike trend. It suffers from some uneven difficulty and overly linear level design, but its impressive story, extremely well-tuned combat, and memorable areas and boss fights mean that this isn’t one you should miss out on. It’s fair to say that sometimes Lies of P emulates its inspiration so closely it feels like someone else is pulling its strings a little too forcefully, but that puppet show is still a whole lot of fun to watch. It’s both praise and criticism to say that Lies of P follows the blueprint pioneered by FromSoftware down to the finest detail, with precious few deviations. The UI and menus are strikingly similar to every soulslike you’ve ever played, the aesthetic is almost identical to Bloodborne, and combat is a methodical dance of attacks and parries designed with difficulty in mind. It sticks so close to the script that it got to the point where I’d meet a seemingly friendly character and think “Ah, this is the one who’s going to betray me later,” with full confidence that I was spot on in that assessment. There’s even a major boss with the same name and rough appearance as a Dark Souls boss, which is honestly just kinda hilarious.  In fact, this isn’t even the first Eurocentric soulslike featuring murderous marionettes! Almost exactly one year ago I reviewed Steelrising, which has a bizarre number of things in common with Lies of P, from its mechanical enemies gone mad to its trendy and historical urban setting. Thankfully, Lies of P is a much better game and manages to stand out in other ways, but it doesn’t exactly earn a whole lot of points for originality. One of the ways it does set itself apart though is with its story, which is a dark reimagining of Carlo Collodi’s Pinocchio – a story about a mischievous puppet known for telling falsehoods and longing to become a real boy. Lies of P’s version takes a lot of liberty in its much more gory and depressing version of the classic tale, but it's got some nice nods to its inspiration, including an untrustworthy cat and fox and a neat mechanic where you have to choose to tell lies or the truth (which have an impact on the outcome of your adventure). This style of game isn’t known for having the most comprehensible stories and Lies of P isn’t wholly an exception to that rule, but it does try more than most. There’s a whole bunch of dialogue and cutscenes that kept my interest throughout my first 30-hour run instead of just a loose collection of vagaries and hints in item descriptions. In fact, of all the distressing and enigmatic stories I’ve seen in this genre, this is definitely among one of my favorites – not quite as relatable and polished as something like <a href=""/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-2/66487/review/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review"">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, but certainly more approachable than your Bloodbornes or your Dark Souls. It’s got some interesting twists and turns, and a few memorable characters too, like the self-obsessed socialite Venigni, who constantly made me want to speak in an over-the-top Italian accent. As you’d expect, you’ll split your time hacking your way through levels where practically everything in sight wants to kill you and taking on much more formidable bosses, and Lies of P largely nails both of those genre pillars. The city of Krat is memorable and dystopian, while also continuously reminding you that you’re playing out an iconic fairytale about puppets. It comes complete with your cricket sidekick Gemini and your puppet-making father Gepetto, who always reminds you to be a good boy right before he sends you on missions to butcher everyone in your path. You’ll visit a puppet graveyard that serves as a kind of poison swamp level that every soulslike legally is required to include, and an exhibition hall filled with hopeful depictions of a future that clearly didn’t work out quite as planned, among others. Each is thoroughly enjoyable to stab your way through. It’s a little disappointing though, that Lies of P is far more linear than most similar games, with a very straightforward path from beginning to end and no significant optional areas or boss fights aside from the odd side quest that sends you back to someplace you’ve already visited to solve a small puzzle in exchange for a new outfit or upgrade material. Once you’ve played through the story, you’ll more or less have seen and done everything there is to see and do – except to do it again on New Game+, of course. Another item on the checklist is some memorable (and usually disgusting) boss fights, and Lies of P’s got those in spades. From an evil puppet law enforcement official to a hulked-out guy who’s basically just Bane from Batman, there’s lots of big things that need to be slapped in the face. Doing so is always enjoyable, even though they’re all pretty straightforward encounters where you whittle down the enemy’s health bar. It would have been nice to have one or two encounters where they mix things up with a puzzle or trick you’ve gotta figure out to best your opponent – those are always my favorite. Also, almost all of the bosses have two phases, which I’m normally a fan of, but they’re used to the point where it became a little grating by the end. Usually the first phase is quite easy, but when the second phase is repeatedly killing me and I have to keep replaying that first phase until I’m completely bored by it, I kinda just wish I could skip it and get to the part that’s actually fun and challenging. Many fights felt like they put the first phase there just as a warmup round before getting to the actual meat of the encounter, but rest assured: by the 10th attempt I was thoroughly warmed up and plenty ready to take another shot at the real boss. For better or worse, much of Lies of P’s combat draws clear inspiration from Bloodborne specifically, with a couple minor tweaks. You can’t restore health lost from direct attacks by striking back at your enemies like in Bloodborne, but you are given the ability to partially block some of that incoming damage then counter to restore the chip damage you absorbed. The result is a similar meta where aggressive gameplay is encouraged, and that keeps fights moving along at a quick pace – but it also discourages more defensive playstyles, which tend to be my go-to in soulslikes. That feisty combat is extremely fun, balanced, and well-tuned, but you’re definitely boxed into playing in a specific way instead of allowing you the freedom to craft diverse builds, like a ranged magic user in <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/30/dark-souls-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dark Souls</a>, for example. Another idea borrowed from Bloodborne is that your melee weapon is assigned to your right hand while your left is reserved for a utility weapon that often include ranged capabilities by turning your robotic left arm into a Winter Soldier-esque tool of destruction, and that ends up being a pretty darn clever take on that mechanic. You might decide to close gaps quickly with the quick and effective Puppet String, which lets you tether a grappling hook onto your enemies, or make use of the formidable Falcon Eyes to turn your arm into a cannon and blow up deranged puppets from afar, or my personal favorite: use the Aegis shield to block incoming attacks and dish out damage in kind with a fiery explosion that triggers when it’s hit. It’s especially cool that each of these tools can be upgraded with additional effects, like the Puppet String’s ability that lets you follow up your grappling hook maneuver with a devastating airborne attack. But it’s the new stuff, namely the completely awesome weapon-crafting system that lets you disassemble any weapon in your arsenal and mix and match the various hilts and blades to create Frankenstein abominations, that really lets Lies of P distinguish itself within a very crowded genre. Have you ever wanted to attach a giant saw blade to a rapier’s handle so you could jab with it like you’re fencing? Well, it’s probably not advisable at all, but knock yourself out. How about attaching Mjolnir’s hammer to the end of a rusty pipe? Go for it, man! You do you. With dozens of possible combinations, you’re given quite a bit of freedom to make some silly or surprisingly effective stuff, as certain stats and abilities from your chosen hilt and blade combine for a unique combat experience. It’s a bit of a shame, though, that the best weapons available are legendary tools that can’t be disassembled and reforged into new items, and many of these are so much more powerful than anything you can build that you’re sorta disincentivized from actually engaging with the crafting system the longer you play. With all that freedom to create silly weapon combinations, it’s a bit disappointing that there aren’t any of the multiplayer modes you find in many of Lies of P’s peers. Not having co-op is understandable since it might break any semblance of balance (plus, who wants to see two Pinocchios wailing on a boss anyway?), but PvP in particular seems like it would fit perfectly with the fast-paced contest of reflexes at which Lies of P excels. Maybe we’ll get something like that as DLC, but for now you’ll need to enjoy your neat builds and creative weapon combinations on your lonesome. Another cool tweak on the formula is Lies of P’s skill tree, which lets you upgrade your puppet’s mechanical innards to snap up some seriously useful upgrades, like adding amulet slots to your loadout, gaining additional Pulse Cells (that are used for healing), and increasing the number of consumable throwing objects you can carry on your person. I spent way too long agonizing over each upgrade decision and considering different ways to optimize my build to improve my chances of becoming a real boy, and that was a pretty nice change of pace in between all those unfortunate murders I had to commit. Of course, the main thing that defines any good soulslike is how soul-crushingly difficult it is, and Lies of P has mixed success in this regard. On one hand, nearly all of the world exploration where I was fighting your run-of-the-mill evil puppets and gross monsters was disappointingly easy, to the point where death was a rare occurrence throughout my playthroughs. The same can be said of most boss fights, which Souls veterans can expect to beat without breaking too much of a sweat since they’re usually big, slow, and stupid creatures who are easily confused when you move behind or underneath them and telegraph all their attacks like they’re in the WWE. But then I’d encounter the occasional showdown where the difficulty spiked up dramatically without warning and I’d die 20 or 30 agonizing deaths on a single boss, leaving me to wonder if I just wasn’t properly leveled or something (which was never the case – I just needed to git gud). Those specific bosses stand in such stark contrast to the much milder exploration sections that it can be quite jarring, and I often felt like the levels preceding a tough boss didn’t properly prepare me for that gauntlet; more likely, my skills probably worsened during the stretch of mostly undemanding travels between the dramatically more difficult boss fights. That inconsistent difficulty is even more noticeable depending on your chosen character build. That’s because, so far as I can tell, playing with a Motivity (Lies of P’s equivalent to a strength stat) build is multitudes less difficult than speccing into Technique (its version of dexterity). As a Technique player, your weapons don’t do much to stagger enemies and your ability to block incoming damage is painfully limited, since you only fully negate a small percentage of the attack unless you’re able to pull off a perfect parry. In order to best the most formidable bosses, you’ll have to learn the enemy’s attack patterns and get down the precise timing required to perfectly parry most attacks before finally breaking the enemy’s guard and laying into them with your fast-moving weapons – a process that’s quite enjoyable, but also extremely unforgiving. Meanwhile, as a Motivity player, you can simply smack down bosses with your heavy weapons that do enormous stagger damage, leaving them wide open to deadly executions. That’s pretty hilarious to watch, but also feels pretty busted, especially compared to a significantly more demanding Technique-focused playthrough. Lies of P also just has some nice little quality-of-life improvements I’d like to see carry over into other soulslikes, like how you don’t lose all your Ergo (its version of souls) by dying, but rather have a certain amount deducted every time you take damage on your way to recover your lost currency; or how you’re notified whenever you’re carrying enough Ergo to level up your character instead of resting at a checkpoint, only to discover you need to kill one more enemy and come back. Little touches like that go a long way. Unfortunately, Lies of P doesn’t manage to rid itself of the clunky roots of the genre completely, and I did encounter some fairly obnoxious bugs during my time with it. Among other things there were a few times where I phased through the environment in a weird way, and enemies have a weird habit of just despawning right in front of me like they were fading away during the season finale of a long-running high school TV drama. Thankfully, none of these issues were particularly widespread, so they’re unlikely to drag down an otherwise perfectly enjoyable adventure, especially since performance is otherwise rocksolid. I maintained a perfectly stable framerate at every point in my adventure, which isn’t a given in this genre. Also, many soulslikes are known for having memorable music, but Lies of P truly stands out in this regard. Not only are the tracks during boss fights great, but there are collectible vinyl records that you can play at a jukebox back at your base – and some of those songs are seriously just fantastic. So much, in fact, that it’s become a bit of an obsession to collect them all – and I’ve still got a lot of searching to do. Seriously, that jukebox made me find excuses to hang out at the social hub, crafting weapons and working on my build. It’s that good! Lies of P might not branch out particularly far from its soulslike inspiration, but like a marionette controlled by a skilled puppet master, it plays the part extremely well in a wonderfully dark fantasy world. It must be said that its uneven difficulty didn’t always make me feel like an underdog, especially when playing as a brawny, overpowered version of Pinocchio with a massive weapon, and combat pigeonholed me into a specific playstyle while the levels are less open and twisting than most. But with an awesome weapon crafting system, some really memorable boss fights, and one of the better stories we’ve seen in this genre, I can enthusiastically recommend you spend your time hanging out with Gepetto and friends. If you’ve been waiting for a Bloodborne remaster or sequel that may never come, Lies of P is the next best thing. "
NBA 2K24 ,6,"NBA 2K24 is like a frustratingly talented superstar who falls short of delivering championships, season after season. The excellent on-court gameplay bolsters significant depth with its dedication to looking, sounding, and feeling like a genuine NBA experience, but it’s sidelined by heinous microtransactions that plague many of the most popular game modes. These in-game purchases aren’t just present and optional – they are essential to compete with other players online. It’s especially frustrating because MyCareer, the focal point of many changes to this year’s iteration, has so much potential. But if it truly aimed to emulate the beauty of pro basketball, it would reward skill and effort more than open-wallet shortcuts.   Despite being a little short on flashy new mechanics to boast about on the back of the box, NBA 2K24 still looks fantastic and its on-court gameplay is incrementally stronger than ever. Topping the list of additions is the new ProPLAY feature, which allowed 2K to take NBA footage and translate it to in-game animations in real timeIn other words, NBA 2K24 is a lot smoother than its predecessors when it comes to movement on the court, including dribbling, shooting, and pass animations. There are fewer immersion-breaking interactions and things feel generally more authentic. This is particularly evident when playing teams with superstar talent. Players like LeBron James look and play almost exactly like their real-life counterparts, and the continued improvement in AI allows the CPU opponent to take advantage of this. I regularly felt challenged, even as a veteran of the NBA 2K series, without feeling cheated. The ball reliably goes into the hands of the best players on the court, and the improved animation makes the resulting action a lot more fun to watch. This challenge extends itself to the offensive side of the ball, where tried-and-true classics like the pick-and-roll aren’t as easy to exploit. Also, off-ball defenders do a better job of understanding their opponent; an example of this would be a drive-heavy forward who can’t shoot, and now opponent players will smartly back off and force a jump shot or to go elsewhere with the ball. Similarly, the adrenaline boost feature, which helps prevent players from dribbling around aimlessly and being rewarded for it, returns with a more interactive twist: Instead of losing a boost for dribbling around, boosts are now lost when a defensive player bumps or interrupts the offensive player’s movement. My experience with this was that it really made defense, especially in online play, more engaging. Not all of the on-court gameplay has taken a significant step forward, however. Fast-break gameplay is still almost entirely nonexistent, which is an issue that has plagued the NBA 2K series for over a decade now. It’s also one of the most fun elements of real-life basketball, so its absence just generally makes good defense less exciting because it rarely turns into points. There are also occasional mind-boggling decisions from the AI, such as calling erroneous timeouts late in games.  You’d think the commentary would call out things like that, but it’s otherwise regularly very good (especially when playing games in the various eras of the NBA), and the ever-present halftime crew of Shaq, Ernie, and Kenny deliver stellar performances. Naturally it’s missing Charles Barkley, who insists he will never be in an NBA 2K game, but the chemistry is still very strong nonetheless. There are some disappointments in the details, however. For instance, players rarely celebrate big moments such as game-winning shots in a convincing way. In fact, they often go from being excited one moment to deadpan the next – something that only really comes across because of how realistic the players look. NBA 2K24 excels at creating tense in-game moments but rarely delivers a reward for them. Having the arena, including the fans, players, and coaches, properly react to big plays would go a long way in matching the NBA’s famous ability to create historic moments.  strong>MyCareer</strong The steps NBA 2K24 takes forward are largely overshadowed by its most popular game mode, MyCareer, and the painstaking lengths it goes through to prod us into in-game purchases. Let me set the table: despite having access to 100,000 virtual currency (VC) that you only get with the Black Mamba or 25th Anniversary editions, my created player rested at a 75 overall after I dumped everything I had into attribute upgrades. I then played MyCareer for about 10 hours, and slowly crawled my way up to an 81 overall. All the while, I’m completely disregarding most of the customizable aspects of MyCareer that make it so fun – including dresswear, better animations, and other personalized elements. I am heavily conflicted about NBA 2K23. On one hand, the new retro game modes have reached out to my inner sports geek and given me a way to replay NBA history in a way that I’ve never done before. Especially paired with a handful of really strong gameplay changes, like improved spacing and AI, I foresee myself dumping dozens of hours into reliving and reconstructing NBA history. Conversely, I now feel completely and utterly isolated from the MyCareer experience. I have no interest in shelling out additional cash (even beyond the expensive Michael Jordan Edition) or grind for insane hours just to be able to compete on the online court, and the density of The City and its shopping opportunities is lost on me for the same reason. Instead, I’ll take my metaphorical basketball and go home, where I can enjoy the parts of NBA 2K23 that I can fully experience without the repugnant emphasis of its microtransactions. <i>– Ben Vollmer, September 14, 2022</i strong>Score: 6</strong Read the full <a href=""/nba-2k23-next-gen-version/60216/review/nba-2k23-review"">NBA 2K23 review</a In spite of that, I was almost always the lowest-rated player on the court. Even without competing against others online, MyCareer placed me in the NBA as an up-and-coming starter on a team of my choice. As a result, I was thrust into an environment where I was regularly guarding players with a major attribute difference, making playing good defense or offense virtually impossible. When I did step on a court with other players online, no amount of skill or precision allowed me to compete with players who had dumped money (likely hundreds of dollars) into their created character. Within just a day or two of release, I was so far behind the curve that the idea of grinding out more VC felt sickening. Effectively, the only way to play here is to pay, and that’s just offensive. That’s especially absurd when you consider that most people will likely purchase the regular edition of NBA 2K24, and they will be rewarded with a created player that starts with a paltry 60 overall rating. And because of the systems at play, losing regularly nets you next to no VC. It establishes a maddening cycle of not having a player good enough to compete without hope of ever being able to improve them. NBA 2K24 wants you to open up your wallet, and punishes you if you don’t. There is even further evidence of this being an intentional cycle, too. Badge progression, a mechanic that helps differentiate players from one another within specific contexts (such as the “Spot Finder” badge, which gives a small speed boost when off-ball and trying to get into open space), can now move both ways. This meant that when I wasn’t actively focusing on improving a specific badge, it would begin to regress to a worse version. For example, if I am working on a badge that improves my long-range shooting ability but come across a matchup that dictates less three-point shooting and more driving to the basket, I now risk that badge progression by altering my gameplan. Not only does this dampen the enjoyment of being creative, it encourages maxing out my stats as quickly as possible so I don’t have to deal with bad matchups in the first place. It’s worth noting that it doesn’t have to be this much of a drag, either. MyCareer comes with a location change this year: an open-world, Miami-inspired beachfront to roam around in. It’s more dense than the previous city, with just about every turn having a storefront, a court to play on, or something to interact with. The variety of court and game types, such as five-on-five or three-on-threes, would be a lot more fun if the matchups weren’t so frequently lopsided. Similarly, there are a ton of fun fashion items to purchase, but they are locked behind massive VC paywalls. Especially in the early stages of NBA 2K24, I regularly had to choose if I wanted my player to look cool or if I wanted him to play well – so once again, it’s impossible to get the most out of MyCareer without forking over additional cash. NBA 2K24 lacks a significant story mode, but there are a handful of loosely connected storylines going on all at once involving the created player, who is nicknamed MP. None of these are very compelling, especially because MP is so lowly rated when the mode begins and yet everyone surrounding him is comparing him to the likes of Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant. As with almost everything else in the mode, it just adds fuel to the frustration of MyCareer being such a grindfest.  strong>Other Modes</strong Following up on NBA 2K23’s Jordan Challenge, NBA 2K24 introduces Mamba Moments to celebrate Kobe Bryant’s historic career. It’s not as impressive as the Jordan Challenges, but it still does a decent job of getting into the tone and atmosphere of some of Kobe’s marquee games. Returning to an era where guys like Vlade Divac and Hedo Turkoglue were key players in the NBA is a treat, especially for those of us who were first exposed to basketball around that time.  Similarly, MyNBA has also added a LeBron era to play in, which puts you in control of the 2011 “Big Three” Miami Heat. As I put more time into NBA 2K24, I’ll seek out the microtransaction-free haven of MyNBA and all of the flexibility it provides. I was able to customize league options, like which teams are able to get the number one pick in the NBA draft, as well as a variety of nuances related to the salary cap. While there aren’t major changes to MyNBA, it remains the best place to sink time if you just want basketball in its purest form.  There is also the more streamlined MyNBA Lite mode that served as a nice place for me to set up shop for a less intense franchise mode. It doesn’t include most of the more in-depth features from MyNBA, and instead focuses on drafting, player acquisition, and getting on the court. It’s another nice escape from in-game purchases, and much more welcoming for beginners. The old adage “a tale of two halves” really encapsulates the NBA 2K24 experience. On one hand, the hardcourt experience is as good as it ever has been (as we should demand from a game that iterates annually), and there are a handful of game modes that allow all of that to be enjoyed without interruption. On the other, much more nefarious hand, MyCareer is nearly unplayable unless you open your wallet or endure an absurd grind. Even worse, mechanics like badge regression reinforce the worst parts of the microtransaction scheme. Beneath those issues, NBA 2K24 still offers a solid basketball experience, but it requires looking in the right places. Clearly, there is a love for the game of basketball on display in modes like MyNBA and Mamba Moments. But a lot of that love is lost the moment we’re asked to pay an absurd amount of money to compete in the main multiplayer mode. "
Starfield ,7,"I feel like I’m the kind of person Starfield was made for. I <i>loved</i> Bethesda’s last single-player RPG, Fallout 4 (maybe a bit too much), and there’s nothing I like more than a sci-fi universe with spaceships, lasers, and political intrigue flying every which way. And yet, a dozen hours into Starfield, I was feeling lost in space. Things never went too far off course while I was flying my rinkydink little ship around chasing down mysterious artifacts and war criminals with a damn fine crew of companions at my side, but man did Starfield make me work hard to get through that opening stretch. Even when it mostly righted the ship and I was loving the story, sidequests, and launching boarding parties on enemy ships, there were still too many problems that constantly popped up, forcing me to curb my excitement. It’s a bit like Starfield’s own elaborate shipbuilder tool: even though you <i>can</i> slap a bunch of high-end parts together and it will technically fly, sometimes it’s just not the best fit. I would expect no less: Bethesda has built out a sprawling universe with detailed lore in which humanity has left Earth behind and colonized the galaxy, but hasn’t made first contact with sentient aliens as of the 24th century. It’s chock-full of backstory about wars between its three major factions, run-ins with mysterious space deathclaws called terrormorphs, pirates, and an immense amount more. I wouldn’t call a lot of it especially distinctive – it’s a setting that’s reminiscent of The Expanse, Firefly, and Starship Troopers, full of references to every sci-fi movie from Aliens to Blade Runner, and of course Interstellar. There’s even a fair bit of Indiana Jones influence as it sends you on a treasure hunt to collect mysterious artifacts. In fact, there’s a significant similarity to what Obsidian created for 2019’s The Outer Worlds. But it’s so densely packed in, with more stories around every corner, that I found it easy to get invested in it – once I learned the difference between the United Colonies and the Freestar Collective.  Creating your character is a matter of picking a background story for them that comes with a set of skills and traits, as well as up to three modifiers. It’s always a bit tough to choose this on your first playthrough, since you don’t really know what you’re getting into and there’s no respecing allowed, but none of them is dramatic enough to really hinder you. Some – like the one where your parents are alive and well (if you don’t pick this they just never come up), or the one where a crazed fan follows you around – sound like they’ll be fun to experiment with later, which adds a sense of replayability.  After that, while everyone starts out in the same mining camp and touches the same space magic that sets off a trippy 2001: A Space Odyssey-style vision, Starfield is an immense game that will send you off in all kinds of different directions once it hands you the keys to your first spaceship. It’s to the point where talking to others who played alongside me left us all bewildered and asking questions like:  i>“Wait, what do you mean you don’t know who the Vanguard are?” </i i></i i>“How did you not meet this person?” </i i></i i>“How are you crafting those weapon mods already?” </i i></i i>“Wow, you didn’t unlock [REDACTED] until level 20?” </i i></i i>“What the heck even is a Va’Ruun?” </i i></i i>“You met who in a bar?”</i i></i i>“Where did you find that ship?” </i If you’re not sticking strictly to one questline and just take missions as they pop up (sometimes you get them simply by walking past NPCs as they chat), you can easily fall down all sorts of wormholes into extended chains of missions that take you on adventures that rival Skyrim’s in scope. Even after about 70 hours there are major questlines I haven’t even touched, and others I barely began. I’m eager to go back and finish a lot of those up now that I’ve completed the main story. In typical Bethesda fashion, that main quest isn’t terribly flexible in how you resolve the situations it thrusts you into. Your options here are, for the most part, about picking whether you want to be a boy scout for whom a good deed is its own reward, a wise-cracking mercenary who asks to be rewarded after doing a good deed, or an all-business mercenary who demands to be paid up front to do the good deed. There are a few choices you can make that affect who lives and who dies, and there’s a decision at the end about which philosophy to embrace heading into the final battle, but most of it is going to play out the same way because, no matter what, your goal is to solve the mystery of the artifacts alongside your secret society of explorers known as Constellation. I won’t say much about where the plot goes because there’s a lot that can easily be spoiled, but I did enjoy the way it probes its biggest concepts – even those we’ve seen plenty of times before – in distinctive ways, and there’s plenty of well-written discussion about what it all means.  It’s in the side quests that you really get to act out your character’s morals: I happened across a dispute between a ship full of colonists and an obnoxious resort planet and had options that included peacefully resolving the conflict (which involves a clever technobabble puzzle) or stealthily sabotaging the ship and blowing up the colonists. There’s a storyline that felt very Boys from Brazil-inspired, as well as numerous related quests about hunting down war criminals and banned technology that pose ethical quandaries to reconcile. You can join up with the Crimson Fleet pirates and dive into a life of smuggling and general space crime, or take up the mantle of a legendary pirate hunter. Watch: Dan joins Ryan McCaffrey, Kahlief Adams, and Taylor Lyles for IGN's Unlocked podcast to talk through what we're loving and... not loving so much about Starfield so far. There’s no shortage of interesting companion characters to hang out with throughout all of this either. I never felt like my Constellation teammates were wasting my time when they asked to chat, since they always had something to share about their background or a quest they wanted me to help them with. There’s definitely a focus on Sarah, the virtuous leader of Constellation, and Sam, a former lawman with a young daughter in tow who he lives in fear of letting down. However, I was richly rewarded for taking the slightly more eccentric scientist Barrett along with me on some missions, and I suspect the others hold a few surprises up their sleeves as well – likely even the ones you hire out of bars when respectable folks like Sam bail on you for picking too many pockets or hijacking too many ships. But you can only take one person with you at a time, so I have more exploration to do here. It helps that Bethesda has certainly upped its facial animation game for Starfield. Granted, it’s nowhere near as precise and lifelike as motion-captured performances we’ve seen in The Last of Us and God of War, but it’s on par with other big RPGs where you interact with hundreds of NPCs for dozens of hours, like Baldur’s Gate 3. Character models are generally expressive enough that they can do justice to the excellent voice performances.  Starfield’s problems, though, are glaring – some of which in ways that are inherently different from Bethesda’s other games. I have to say that the early hours are pretty rough going, and there was a while where I was wondering if the stars would ever align. So this review is going to go through that rough patch, too, as I lay this out. But bear with me – just like Starfield itself, it does get better by the end. The biggest fundamental contradiction within Starfield’s design is that while this is a galaxy-spanning adventure with literally hundreds of worlds you can land on and explore, it can feel extremely small when each of them is separated by little more than a (thankfully) brief loading screen. The first few times I set out I really got into it: I’d enter my ship, climb to the cockpit, strap myself in, then watch the cool animation as my ship blasted into orbit. Then I’d open the nav screen, select a star and a planet to set my course, and grav-jump to my destination before selecting a landing spot and watching my ship set down in a blaze of retro thrusters and dust. But then I realized that, in many circumstances, I could bypass most of that procedure by just going to the map screen and jumping to another planet without even setting foot on my ship. Put another way, while you can walk across an Elder Scrolls or Fallout world without ever fast-traveling, in Starfield you can’t go <i>anywhere</i> without fast-traveling. A mission might send you to the other side of the vast starmap, but the actual travel time between systems is always the same (and the poorly explained fuel system, which is actually just your range, isn’t much of a limitation). When I discovered that so much of space flight is effectively a series of non-interactive cutscenes, it largely shattered the illusion of exploring a vast universe. It’s impossible <i>not</i> to compare Starfield to the way you freely enter and exit planets’ atmosphere in No Man’s Sky, so it’s a bit of a letdown every time you see a planet and remember it’s just <i>a picture</i> of a planet you’ll never be able to reach by flying toward it. It’s something that happens <i>a lot</i>. The world, exploration, crafting, atmosphere, and story of Fallout 4 are all key parts of this hugely successful sandbox role-playing game. Great new reasons to obsessively gather and hoard relics of happier times, strong companions, and sympathetic villains driving tough decisions make it an adventure I’ll definitely replay and revisit. Even the technical shakiness that crops up here and there can’t even begin to slow down its momentum. <i>– Dan Stapleton, November 9, 2015</i Read the full <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/fallout-4-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Fallout 4 review</a The next nuisance that irritated me no matter where in the Settled Systems I roamed is the fact that there are no actual maps – mini or otherwise – to refer to when you’re on foot. All you get is an extremely low-detail display showing you large points of interest – such as the many abandoned research and mining posts where raiders and robots wait for you to shoot and loot them – and the large swaths of alien wasteland and wilderness that separates them. Within a city, there’s nothing to guide you around beyond shop signs and text-only directories that tell you what stores are located in which district, but not where they actually are. My guess is that this was a deliberate choice Bethesda made to mitigate the fast-travel problem, where we’re just zipping through the universe without stopping to appreciate the detail and thought that went into creating dramatically different cities like the gleaming capital of New Atlantis, the frontier settlement of Akila, and the dingey cyberpunk metropolis of Neon, among others. And these places <i>are</i> fascinating to look at. The reality, though, is that this isn’t even how we get around the real world today – not since the iPhone rolled out in 2007 – so it’s exasperating to be in the year 2330 with no comparable navigation tools. I spent way too much time running in circles searching for basic things like vendors to sell my loot to while I tried to memorize the layouts of multiple settlements, annoyed that if I were playing after launch I could’ve just checked IGN’s guides for their locations. The tradeoff in immersion just doesn’t seem worth it.  The third ever-present annoyance is, fortunately, one that stands out as something that can be fixed without a major overhaul. Like Bethesda’s previous RPGs, Starfield is a game that is roughly 30% inventory management… and yet it is shockingly bad at that task. To avoid becoming overloaded you’ll constantly need to transfer the weapons, space suits, materials, and alien goo you’ve collected between your inventory and your companion’s, or to and from your ship’s cargo hold, but maddeningly you can’t view the contents and capacities of both the giving and receiving container at the same time. You’re just blindly dumping things out of one until you get a message saying the other is full. All the while, much of the screen is wasted on an overly large image of an item. It’s a bizarre and aggravating step backward from Fallout 4, and the kind of thing I expect modders to remedy within a week of launch. Those problems never got better during my playthrough – I just learned to live with them. The hump that I did get over, though, is that Starfield just doesn’t tell you enough about how its huge collection of systems work, and it trickles out the cool stuff too slowly. Out of the gate you can’t mod your equipment, you can’t use your spacesuit’s boost pack (which is super useful and fun, especially in low gravity, and I can’t imagine not having it for an entire playthrough), and you can barely use stealth or board enemy ships at all. You have to put a skill point, of which you only get one per level, into those to unlock them.  And yet from the start you <i>can</i> build outposts that are a lot like Fallout 4’s settlements and can extract resources for you, but Starfield doesn’t tell you that you probably shouldn’t bother for a long while. Early on you don’t need huge quantities of a single resource, so it’s largely a waste of time until you’ve climbed to the higher ranks of the crafting skill trees. You probably don’t want to go out of your way to mass produce anything early on, because storage space on the first tier of ships is obnoxiously small for the amount of loot you gather (and there are an incredible amount of minerals and materials that seemed like I’d be kicking myself later for not bringing with me). I resorted to silly workarounds like simply throwing junk on the floor of my ship like a space hoarder, which somehow doesn’t count toward your storage space. It’s also worth noting that the worlds you explore are generally visually different (with varying levels of gravity) but fairly barren and lifeless. You’d expect that from planets that’re mostly uninhabitable and untouched by intelligent beings, but that doesn’t make them a lot more fun to run around; outside of a handful of scattered outposts all there is to do is scan rocks or zap them with a mining laser, or sometimes scan and maybe shoot alien wildlife. It’s a far cry from Bethesda’s previous games, where you generally couldn’t swing a dead mudcrab without hitting something interesting. There’s one part of the main quest that’s pretty repetitive, too. You’re sent to investigate a series of ancient structures, and it’s annoying that what you do inside each one is completely identical. The rewards are different and enticing enough for me to want to chase them all down, at least, but after the first few I couldn’t help but wish that Bethesda’s designers had taken some inspiration from Breath of the Wild when it came to creating different puzzles for each one. It wasn’t until a dozen or so hours in that I unlocked enough upgrades that things started to gel for me. Starfield is absolutely one of those games that takes way too long to get to the good part. But the fact that it eventually <i>did</i> get its claws into me forced me to jettison all of the “More like Starfailed!” jokes I’d been workshopping into space and focus more on what this sci-fi epic gets right – or at least, does well enough.  Filed under “does well enough” is combat, which is the thing you’ll likely solve most problems with unless you’re extremely dedicated to the idea of talking or sneaking your way past most encounters with hostile pirates, robots, wildlife, and anything else that looks at you funny. It’s not bad, and it’s kept me happily plinking away with my tricked-out laser rifles and shotguns, but not especially good, either. Without anything new and exciting to fill the void left by Fallout’s distinctive VATS system, gunplay is left feeling largely unmemorable. Even when you unlock some late-game abilities it’s still pretty straightforward. To their credit, enemies do react in amusing ways when shot in their heads, legs, or arms, and they will sometimes flee when you’ve killed off their friends. This definitely isn’t the first game in which I’ve seen a soldier panic just before his jetpack explodes, but that never really gets old. By and large, though, these feel like they could be bad guys from Far Cry or Borderlands or any number of other RPG/shooter hybrids. I was especially disappointed by the more powerful enemies you run into in the latter half of the story; oftentimes they simply stand there shooting at me while I empty my shotgun into their faces and stagger or otherwise disable them, ending those supposedly big fights just as they began.  Combat is also kept interesting by the loot: the modifiers on epic and legendary weapons and gear have some fun stuff going on. I found a rifle that weighed just 0.14 kilograms instead of three or four, and one that does more damage as my health decreases and makes enemies more likely to drop med packs. I found a spacesuit that has a 10% chance to set nearby attackers on fire and made me invisible when I crouched and held still. Some weapons do more damage in space and less on the ground; some boostpacks give you significantly reduced oxygen (stamina) consumption. These are modifiers that aren’t afraid to be dramatic enough to be game-changers that you’d build your character around. The other side of combat is ship-to-ship battles, which are also fairly simple as space dogfighting games go. Even so, it’s entertaining enough to blast away at pirates (or to become one yourself) and watch the resulting explosions tear ships into pieces. There’s some basic power management where you can divert energy between your weapons systems, engines, and shields, but I never really felt the need to fiddle with that in combat because most ships I bought or found had enough power to go around if I wasn’t powering my grav drive (and there’s little reason to in a fight until you decide to make a run for it). Unlike the classic X-Wing games there are no shield facings to adjust, so it’s mostly just light and arcadey blasting. It’s also somewhat disappointing that the in-cockpit displays don’t actually function – your only radar is directional indicators on the edges of your screen. The closest thing to VATS you get in Starfield is in space combat. When you spend a skill point on target locking, it zooms in the view and lets you select one of the enemy’s systems to pelt with lasers, ballistic guns, and missiles. (This is another one of those skills where it’s a little crazy that it isn’t unlocked by default.) Disabling a ship’s weapons is a great way to even the odds when you’re being ganged up on by three or four pirates and don’t have time to fully destroy one, but even better is that when you take out their engines it leaves them vulnerable to being boarded. Some of the best moments in my Starfield playthrough have happened during these raids as I went room by room mopping up enemies (sometimes with the gravity on the fritz and corpses floating by like in Star Trek VI) until I reached the bridge, gunned down the captain, and sat in their chair to seize their ship and its cargo for myself. I didn’t turn to the enticingly profitable smuggling and piracy during my traditional “good guy” first playthrough, but I can certainly see the appeal of that style of play being more than worth the bounties you’d incur and the companions you’d alienate.  Another highlight of Starfield is the sheer variety of spaceships flying through the Settled Systems, and the fact that they’re so modular and customizable made me wish I’d put more points into starship design so that I could mess with it more and learn the somewhat complicated rules of how to snap the pieces together to form a spaceworthy vessel. It really is wonderful to see your ship on the landing pad so that you can appreciate the scale of it before getting behind the controls. Alas, there is no ability to respec your skills, and by the time I realized the major investment I’d need to fully unlock shipbuilding it was too late for this run. For all the criticism I have with the stinginess of the skill system, especially in the early hours, it does deserve credit for its clever hybridizing of traditional RPG skill unlocks and The Elder Scrolls’ system of increasing your skills as you use them. Every time you level up a skill you unlock a challenge, which might be as simple as killing X enemies with laser weapons or as situational as using your boost pack X times during combat, and this has to be completed before you can spend another point to level the skill up again. That’s a noticeable bit of progression that pops up between levels, and adds to the roleplaying feeling that my character has actually honed this skill instead of magically mastering it.  Finally, I have to make a special mention of the lockpicking minigame, which is a simple but satisfying challenge that makes you visualize how several pieces fit together to fill holes. This may be the best unlocking minigame I’ve ever seen in an RPG, and I put more skill points into it than I probably needed to just to gain access to more challenging locks. It’s nice to see one of these that’s rewarding to do rather than a chore that must be endured to earn a reward.  Are there bugs? Of course there are. Playing primarily on PC (with an RTX 3080 on high settings) I’ve seen a fair amount of model and texture pop-in, occasional crashes, performance slowdowns (mostly during autosaving), wonky waypoints, clipping issues, wrong camera angles during conversations, etc. Though I have to say it’s been fairly stable for a big RPG – I never had a quest I couldn’t finish, for instance. Your results will vary; with a game this complex they always do. On Xbox, our staff has seen a few dips in the Series X’s 30fps target, but nothing egregious; a couple of people had save files become corrupted, but there were always more autosaves to fall back on so it wasn’t a disaster. It’s never a great sign when someone recommends a game on the grounds that it gets good after more than a dozen hours, but that’s very much the kind of game Starfield is, and I do recommend it. There are a lot of forces working against it, and the combination of disjointed space travel, nonexistent maps, aggravating inventory management, and a slow rollout of essential abilities very nearly did it in. It was the joys piloting a custom spaceship into and out of all sorts of morally ambiguous situations in a rich sci-fi universe that eventually pulled it out of a nosedive. I’m glad that I powered through the early hours, because its interstellar mystery story pays off and, once the ball got rolling, combat on foot and in space gradually became good enough that its momentum carried me into New Game+ after I’d finished the main story after around 60 hours. Like Skryim and Fallout 4 before it, there’s still an immense amount of quality roleplaying quests and interesting NPCs out there, waiting to be stumbled across, and the pull to seek it out is strong. "
Sea of Stars ,8,"I had to go back and play a little of Chrono Trigger just to make sure my eyes weren’t deceiving me about the obvious similarities between that classic RPG and Sea of Stars. This brand-new yet old-school game doesn’t present nearly as much time-hopping or world-traveling as its clearest inspiration, but its seafaring adventure still has plenty of twists and turns that fill up a solid 30 hours of linear spelunking. Rich and often funny character-driven stories wrap up with surprising twists that give weight to the story and provide a reason for its visually wild and mechanically interesting boss fights. At the same time, there’s just not that much depth to its combat options, and its 16-bit graphics generally satisfy nostalgic cravings rather than inspiring shock and awe all over again.   By its name alone, Sea of Stars may immediately sound like a generic knockoff of its forebears. The opening scenes present a story about two decently written albeit occasionally overly talkative teenage protagonists who set off to save the world by skipping over to a neighboring island to kill off the big bad once and for all. Fortunately, saving the world is never so simple, and the story’s true form begins to take shape before too long. The brilliance of this is how many times it twists and turns in a completely unexpected direction before the real ending, and I’m pleased by how it unfolds into a story about the importance of each individual.  It conveys the story competently, without frontloading too much exposition after letting you loose within its first hour or so. I’m impressed by how it introduces its villains, magic, and the stakes of its world organically, and if you want to know more you can simply return to camp and speak to the traveling bard to hear them recount the stories about the world and its denizens that took place there. Speaking of progression, Sea of Stars excels in its level design. This map is split up into islands that are navigated in an overworld that connects different zones with no combat between them, much like in the classic Chrono Trigger. But once you get into a zone, there are often tons of combat encounters and puzzles that fill up the space between larger story moments and boss battles. You get to fight a giant world-eating kraken, and a robot queen that transforms into a giant handgun! And most of them feel like a well-balanced challenge rather than something you have to grind to overcome.  There’s an admirable amount of variety as well. One particularly cool zone had me tumbling down a series of cascading waterfalls adorned by gorgeous plants and flowers, whereas another had me exploring a clockwork castle and teaming up with its immortal residents to face a big boss. It all did a fantastic job of sucking me in and not letting go, much like the RPGs that inspired it. The puzzles are simple but often require a decent amount of thought. There are some tricky block-pushing puzzles and some that require you to remember a certain sequence of triggers to erect platforms in a certain order so you can climb up to the next doorway. Sea of Stars also makes great use of day and night mechanics, often requiring you to shift the time of day with the shoulder buttons to shine daylight or moonlight on special nodes that unlock parts of the map.  It’s cool that this world’s NPCs respond to your actions and your growing power as literal superheroes, and it’s nifty to eventually gain the ability to fly – that lets you move around the overworld and finish up quests without the hindrance of returning to your ship. Yes, Sea of Stars has a ship, but you won’t spend too much time sailing around since it mostly just serves to connect major points of interest between story events. The world’s most interesting side locations, such as the many Solstice Shrines dotting the map, only become available to visit once you unlock flight. But I’m especially impressed by how the protagonists’ solstice warrior powers are represented in combat. Zale is a blade dancer attuned to the fire magic of the sun, whereas Valere is a lunar monk attuned to the ice magic of the moon. While facing a few of the campaign’s biggest bosses and their minions, they are often the only two party members capable of dealing damage with their basic attacks and spells. This frustrated me at first, but as the campaign went on I began to understand its pivotal lock-pattern mechanic. Battles are fully turn-based, but enemies liven things up by telegraphing their upcoming attacks in patterns that can be broken with attacks of specific types. For instance, you can interrupt an enemy powering up a spell by hitting them three times with fire attacks, breaking their concentration, and staggering them until their next move. Later on, these patterns grow more complex and require a mix of attacks from your teammates, and it’s interesting how the other available party members contribute to these fights even without the same damage output. This often lends their unique fighting styles to group combos that can inflict multiple types of damage and break certain locks after the combo bar is powered up through regular attacks. This momentum is helped along by basic attacks that restore MP and can potentially release bubbles of live mana that your active party member can absorb to add potency to the next move.  Each party member also gets their own unique ultimate move which functions similarly to summons in a Final Fantasy game; showing a cool cinematic before dealing a massive amount of damage. They’re not as exploitable, though, since they rely on their own gauge that builds up over the course of battles. It’s great that you can affect the flow of combat by pressing a button to critical hit, critical heal, or block an incoming attack as it lands. I found it satisfying that most later battles required me to hit these boosts consistently in order to feel fair. But it took a while to get the hang of because their reaction window is frustratingly short, and without using a special relic that shoots a flare each time you land a boost, it’s not always clear exactly when you’re supposed to respond. That’s especially hard to pin down when each animation has a different point of impact. For instance, one character jumps around before landing their strike on an enemy, and it’s easy to tap too soon or too late unless you memorize this whole thing. Even so, it’s still extremely satisfying to pull off certain moves that require you to react to these finicky windows.  Overall though, I’m disappointed Sea of Stars’ combat system doesn’t get much deeper than that. With only six potential teammates to play with – and only a few skills and combos total – I found myself running through the same strategies over and over by the end. Often, the most fun part of progression was getting better at precise timing. The campaign wraps up just before the limited combat options overstay their welcome, but I’d have liked a few more spells or combos per character to master. In its favor, there’s a lot of strong nostalgia vibes here. I grew up playing the 16-bit SNES, GBA, and PS1 classics – essentially, the good old days of RPGs –  and Sea of Stars hits all the right notes to make me long for those good old times. Its zones are varied and colorful, featuring emotive soundtracks composed by none other than Yasunori Mitsuda and Rainbowdragoneyes. The former produced the soundtracks for Chrono Trigger and Xenogears – to name a few – and his unique style brings back memories of those old games. Each area exudes a unique personality, thanks to catchy tunes that masterfully capture their essence.  Everything about Sea of Stars’ look and feel is clean and approachable, and each of its menus is easy to navigate. Even its side quests are easy to finish once you approach the endgame, thanks to a convenient map that tells you which areas still have more things to do and find. Save points and campfires are scattered liberally, and it was great to never have to worry about autosaves – they’re placed exactly where you need them: before tough fights.  It’s neat that you can easily return to your camp from the overworld or from any campfire, where you can speak to key characters and craft food for the next adventure. I also liked the fact that healing items take the form of food rather than generic potions. Cooking ingredients are easy to find, and there’s a real benefit to discovering new recipes and taking the time to play around with Sea of Stars’ competent fishing system in order to keep your pantry stocked – particularly because each item has a different effect, such as healing the whole party’s mana or reviving a single teammate. Since you can only carry 10 food items at once, it does add an extra layer of consideration when choosing which items to carry in your loadout, but it never feels unbalanced.  I only wish there were more ways to customize my party’s playstyle, given that each character only has a few pieces of equipment available to them. Unique accessories are sparse, and those we have lack much oomph. This means there’s even less customization than there is in Final Fantasy 16, and that can make the RPG elements of Sea of Stars feel weaker for anybody who doesn’t find themselves invested in the story.   Sea of Stars is an excellent tribute RPG that channels the best parts of its ‘90s-era forebears like Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 6, and even Star Ocean: The Second Story. Because of that, it’s fair to say that its world, graphical style, and mechanics aren’t wholly original, but there are enough interesting twists in its 30-hour story to make for a rich and enjoyable experience of its own merit. This isn’t just nostalgia fodder. That said, its twitchy combat can be difficult to get a handle on, and once you do, it only stays interesting for so long before its limited customization options make it start to feel just a little repetitive. That’s made up for by a strong soundtrack, an approachable and endearing story, and a wide number of fun zones and boss fights that make this a trip worth taking. "
Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon ,8,"It’s been a hot minute since the last time we were able to pile bunker an enemy mech in the face, but the team at From Software has finally returned to their roots with Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon. It certainly looks and feels the part of a modern mecha action game, with gorgeous graphics, a rock-solid 60fps frame rate that never falters, and an intuitive control scheme that dramatically reduces the learning curve we had to deal with in prior Armored Core games. At the same time, its bland mission briefings and a few elements of its design feel a bit stuck in their old ways. But Armored Core 6 scores direct hits in the spots it matters the most: specifically the highly customizable, intense, and frantic mecha battles. If there’s one area where Armored Core 6 could have benefited from more modernization, it’s in its storytelling. The five-chapter campaign plays out almost entirely over radio conversations, PowerPoint presentation-style mission briefings, and combat chatter that is nearly impossible to pay attention to while you’re fighting for your life on the mining planet of Rubicon. It doesn’t help that our character is a blank slate who just does whatever they’re told, fighting on behalf of corporations, resistance forces, arms dealers, or the enigmatic Walter and his personal agenda. As a result, despite an interesting setting and premise with plenty of teases of ulterior motives and questionable loyalties, I found it hard to really connect with the story on anything beyond a pure surface level, which is a shame because one of the major ideas of Armored Core 6 is a branching storyline that has you making decisions on which faction you want to take on missions for. I just didn’t really care one way or the other.  However, one of the benefits of this mission structure is that it’s able to allow for a wide variety of objectives that each favor a different style of play, which then feeds into the excellent customization elements that make up the heart of Armored Core 6. Before you sortie into a mission, you’re able to equip your mech with four weapons — one for each arm and one attached to each shoulder — a unique head, body, legs, generator, booster, and Fire Control System. And oh boy, are there a ton of different factors to consider beyond simply what to spend your limited money on. The external parts of your mech all have their own weight, defensive value, AP (health), and what’s known as Attitude Stability, which affects how quickly you get staggered from consecutive hits. Parts with higher defensive stats naturally weigh a lot more and require sturdier but slower leg parts in order to carry the burden, and weapons that weigh a lot require larger, stronger, and heavier arm parts. But that’s not all! Certain weapons also take a ton of energy to wield, and thus require generators that have large EN (energy) capacities in order to even equip them. But then you have to balance <i>that</i> with the fact that your energy regeneration could suffer, which means energy management gets much more difficult once you’re actually in the mission. Before you even start making those decisions you should consider what range you expect your mech to be fighting at so you can optimize your internal parts for that role… and the list just goes on and on. That may sound like a lot, and I’m not gonna lie: it is. But still, I felt like Armored Core 6 did a great job guiding me with its sorting tools and descriptive text, which made it easy enough for me to discern what parts were good for what. As long as I had the idea in my head of what kind of mech I wanted to make, it was fairly easy to bring that idea to life. Over the course of the campaign I piloted a lightweight scout with fast boosts that excelled at evasion, a medium-sized destroyer that could wield heavier weaponry without sacrificing too much mobility, and a mobile fortress outfitted with the heaviest and most devastating weapons money could buy – and several in between. What all of this customization amounts to is making every mission feel like a satisfying combat puzzle. Even though there are certainly loadouts that felt stronger than others (hello dual kinetic shotguns on a medium sized bipedal mech), there was never a one-size-fits-all solution to every mission, which is a testament to the stellar design and variety of the missions themselves. You’ll never do the same thing twice. One mission had me investigating a seemingly abandoned outpost, only to be ambushed by stealth ACs that I needed to scan in order to target; another had me dropping down into an underground facility, carefully descending from platform to platform so as to avoid getting disintegrated by the laser cannon at the bottom; and another still had me infiltrating a cave to destroy a generator, which I did, and then had to book it out of there to avoid getting caught up in the resulting explosion. It kept the action fresh throughout the entirety of the 15-hour campaign and beyond. Failing missions is part of the process, and it's something that will very likely happen to you <i>a lot.</i> But fortunately the checkpoint system is fairly generous, and you’re given an opportunity to change the assembly of your mech after every death. This made it so that every failure came with an opportunity to assess what went wrong, and think about how I could fix it. Coming back with the right answer, whether that was simply by switching out my weapon or a more drastic revamp involving changing up my AC archetype, was always satisfying. That said, I <i>really </i>wish that you could also access the shop as well when you die. If you don’t already have the thing you need to beat whatever you’re stuck on, you have to back out of the mission, buy it, and then restart from the beginning. One of the things that I appreciated right out of the gate in Armored Core 6 is that I was able to pick up the controls extremely quickly. It’s all very intuitive: Right and left triggers fire your right and left arm weapons, right and left bumpers fire your right and left shoulder weapons, X jumps, square dodges, circle toggles your booster jets, clicking in the left stick makes you go into a sprint-like assault burst mode, and clicking in the right stick changes your lock-on mode.  I’ve seen a lot of discussion from longtime Armored Core fans who are not happy about there being a hard lock-on system, with the argument that it lowers the skill ceiling, but I think From Software has found a really delicate balance with it. If you turn on the targeting-assist mode you gain the advantage of keeping the camera fixed on a specific target, but you’re less accurate with your shots. As a result, I found myself switching between the two modes frequently – using the targeting-assist mode so I wouldn’t lose track of a fast-moving boss, and then switching it off and manually keeping it in my sights when I felt like It was time to counter-attack. Having the hard-lock also allows for some really dynamic and intense boss fights that would’ve been much more frustrating to deal with if I didn’t have a way to always keep the boss in my sights. More than anything, though, combat in Armored Core 6 just feels good. The wide assortment of weapons all feel satisfying in their own way, whether that’s using a charged shot from a linear rifle on an unaware enemy to kill them in one shot, nimbly dashing around with dual shotguns and laying waste to a whole military base, or juggling quad rocket launchers between your arms and shoulders. Things can feel downright anime-like at times with how many missiles you’re able to fire at once – and with how many missiles get fired <i>at you</i>. In addition to the regular missions, there’s an arena mode that pits you against steadily increasingly difficult one-on-one fights against named ACs, each with their own unique loadout and assembly. You’ll definitely want to go through them too, as completing arena fights rewards you with currency you can use to strengthen your mech and further customize your playstyle. You could increase your damage with a specific type of weapon, increase your defense, unlock core abilities like a super-satisfying kick out of your assault boost, and much more. Better still, you can respec at any point for a fairly modest fee. If you wanna test your arena skills against actual humans, you can do that as well, in both 1-on-1 and 3-on-3 online matches. I didn’t get to test out the netcode extensively in my review period, but the few matches that I did play were super smooth and a ton of fun. And of course, if cosmetic customization is your thing, there’s a ton of options to paint your mech whatever color combination you desire, place a variety of decals you unlock through arena fights, create your own custom decals, then save and share your creation with the rest of the world. Beating Fires of Rubicon’s campaign unlocks a New Game+ mode that allows you to take all of your unlocked parts through the story missions again from the very beginning. There’s also a lot of incentive to play through NG+ in the form of multiple endings, new story branching points, entirely new and more difficult missions, and even a whole new set of arena matches to fight through. Needless to say, you’ll definitely want to go through this more than once to get everything that AC6 has to offer. Armored Core 6 doesn’t look to reinvent the bipedal legs of the mech action genre, but it does update, refine, and polish them to an aggressive shine. Every sortie is a satisfying combat puzzle to solve thanks to fantastic mission design, intense boss encounters, an extremely wide assortment of weapons and parts that can dramatically affect how your mech plays, and excellent, explosive combat that manages to take very complex systems and mechanics and make them easy to understand and execute. Its interesting premise is stifled by bland storytelling told through mission briefings and radio chatter, but this is still nonetheless a welcome return of a classic mecha series. "
Immortals of Aveum ,8,"Much like the waistband of MacGyver’s trousers, Immortals of Aveum is a gun-free zone. This may sound like a peculiar predicament for a first-person shooter to place itself in, but developer Ascendant Studios has made it work. How, you ask? <i>Magic</i>. And I’m not being facetious here; I mean, literal barrages of brightly-coloured bullets magically blasted from the fingertips of a bloke who really puts the war in warlock. An unexpected collision of traditional high fantasy adventure with slick FPS action, Immortals of Aveum boasts a wonderful backdrop for its classy combat and comes with everything I crave in a modern shooter: it’s striking to look at, sturdy to play, and it’s strictly single-player only. There are times when Immortals of Aveum feels like Wolfenstein with wizards, and others when it feels like Doctor Strange has been airdropped directly into Doom. It’s a curious concoction but it’s one that works surprisingly well, and I’ve particularly enjoyed how different Aveum is to anything I’ve played in recent memory. The firefights are frantic and visually spectacular, the light platforming and puzzle work is generally satisfying, and the world itself is very well-crafted.  Aveum’s arcanepunk aesthetic is very absorbing and creates a world of interesting extremes; it’s a world where magic is ubiquitous and powers highly-advanced technology for war-torn societies still living a medieval-inspired lifestyle. This means wild flying machines and mindbending virtual puzzle rooms juxtaposed against gilded castles and ramshackle timber slums. It’s a cool clash of styles, and straddling multiple genres seems to suit Aveum’s ambitions as a first-person shooter with a twist. We play as Jak who, in a moment of extreme stress in the opening phase of the story, is suddenly revealed to possess the power of a Triarch – an extremely rare person able to wield the world of Aveum's three forms of magic simultaneously. Jak subsequently finds himself drafted into the Everwar – a battle for control over Aveum’s magic that has been raging for millennia but appears to be barrelling towards a catastrophic conclusion. The story specifics get a little lost in the weeds during occasional salvoes of fantasy phrases but it’s otherwise easy to follow – and there’s a steady cadence of moderate twists to keep it from getting bogged. If you want to get seriously steeped in lore there’s a lot of optional stuff to dig through, but it definitely isn’t required to sufficiently understand what’s going on. There are some very elegant ecological and social parables tucked in here, too, and I ultimately appreciated the contemporary relevance – and that the story wasn’t just spinning its wheels mindlessly. I’ve noticed some resistance to the choice to use modern vernacular and colloquialisms in Aveum’s dialogue, but I honestly can’t see myself being as engaged as I was if Ascendant had opted instead for po-faced, pseudo–Early Modern English. In fact, I’d argue that leaning on archaic language would only undermine how otherwise fresh and modern Aveum feels in the first-person shooter space. Not every line lands – and there’s a certain Generation Z angst about Jak that I didn’t always find entirely endearing – but the performances are good and I can get behind it broadly. Besides, I don’t know about you, but I don’t know that I need all my fantasy stories sifted through a Shakespeare filter just to dress up the dialogue with some 400-year-old dribble. On default difficulty, Aveum kept me busy for well over 20 hours to reach the credits. It’s nicely paced and strikes a good balance between switching up our surroundings for new locations and returning us to places we’ve already visited. While there are a few drab and dreary spots, most of Aveum’s environments are exceptionally good looking – from its giant lava pools to its icy and jagged crystal caves. The excellent lighting is regularly a strong component of what makes Aveum’s levels so eye-catching. It’s a relatively linear experience and not a single open world, but there are some maps that are admittedly quite large and primed for exploring off the main path. There were definitely occasions I found myself slightly frustrated at Jak’s inability to leap on and over surfaces that look entirely suitable for standing on, but my bigger frustration was the lack of communication around things Jak couldn’t access yet by design. For instance, Aveum was very quick to have Jak drop an audio solution to an environmental puzzle I was already well on top of solving, but it’s also content to leave me fruitlessly trying to figure out how to get into a bonus area Jak literally hasn’t been rewarded with the ability to do yet. Jak’s list of abilities is, however, impressively long. They’re also rationed out until quite deep into the story, meaning things that might have stumped us hours and hours prior may suddenly make sense. Aveum feels a little plain at first, when Jak is limited to just his initial basic spell strikes, but as the story progresses he gains access to far more interesting attacks and abilities. These include things like sticky charges that have a slow-motion effect, the ability to hover after a double jump, and a lash that drags enemies in for an easier close quarters kill. Aveum is undoubtedly a lot more than a disguised military shooter with finger guns. The finger guns are a fun touch, though, and they’re essentially split into three categories. Blue magic attacks function as a large calibre pistol, green magic attacks manifest as rapid fire SMG rounds, and red magic attacks are essentially a sawn-off shotgun. Red attacks are reloaded by fist pumping, by the way. Now we know what Tiger Woods is doing every time he sinks a putt. However, if you’re worried this means there are only three basic “weapons” in Aveum, don’t be; there are variations on each that change their damage, fire rate, and shots per reload depending on the associated “sigil” you equip to Jak’s arm, and there’s also another layer of secondary attacks – from damaging blastwaves to snaking volleys of magic missiles. There’s even an extremely potent beam that combines all three magic colours in a single, destructive torrent – gushing forwards like someone just knocked Cyclops’ sunglasses off. I really enjoy how powerful this attack makes Jak feel, and it’s crucial in some of the tougher boss battles. Aveum does motivate us to engage with discovering and experimenting with new sigils, although it also didn’t punish me for settling with the ones I had already fully upgraded and sticking with them until the end of the story. There’s a significant degree of controller gymnastics required to get the most of Aveum’s combat. I would also say that, as a man with the multitasking abilities of a peanut, it certainly grazes the upper limit to the amount of systems I can effectively juggle at once. At its most hectic I was nursing multiple ability cooldowns, boosting both my health and mana levels, switching sigils depending on which enemy poses the most immediate threat, and slinging special spells to deal out the fastest damage I can – all while building my big beam attack. At times, I felt on top of it; at other times things descended into panicked blasting. The strength of Aveum is that it all looks rather spectacular either way. Whether you’re efficiently and ruthlessly carving through enemies with focus and finesse – or wading into battle spamming spells and seeing what works – combat is a wild storm of shattering shields and colourful fireworks at a welcome 60 frames per second on consoles. Movement is smooth, and Jak feels agile and responsive compared to the bulk of his foes. Jak is by definition one of the most dangerous battlemages in all of Aveum, and I certainly felt like that most of the time. Immortals of Aveum is an impressively confident first-person shooter that successfully trades muzzles and magazines for mages and magic. Its fast-paced, spellcasting combat is both satisfying to master and spectacular to look at, and it features a lengthy and hearty campaign packed with secrets to keep us going well after the story has wrapped. As someone who desperately hopes that unapologetically single-player shooters will live forever, these Immortals have done a great job of making sure they’re definitely not dead yet. "
Baldur's Gate 3 ,10,"Every once in a long while, a game comes along that is so memorable, exciting, fresh, and well-written that it sets a new high-water mark for an entire genre. Baldur's Gate 3 is such an achievement for the tabletop roleplaying-inspired, swords and sorcery adventuring that its BioWare-made CRPG predecessors helped popularize decades ago. Larian Studios has turned this corner of Dungeons &amp; Dragons’ Forgotten Realms into a beautiful, detailed world stocked with too many fully-realized, powerfully written, and skillfully voiced characters to count. There are heart-wrenching choices to be made, alliances to be forged, bears to be romanced, and a vast diversity of interesting, challenging turn-based combat encounters. I didn't merely enjoy my 130-plus hours on this journey. I fell in love.   One issue video games have often run into when trying to adapt the experience of playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons on the tabletop is that it’s almost impossible to achieve the freedom and imagination you get to express in overcoming problems using real-world logic. It's hilarious in other RPGs when you have a spell that can blow an ogre to kingdom come, but is no match for the might of a wooden gate. And while it’s doubtful that any game will ever match that level of flexibility, Baldur's Gate 3 is a big step forward from what we’ve been able to do in the likes of Skyrim or Dragon Age. Those gates aren't going to stop a determined warlock. If something looks flammable, you can probably light it up with a fire spell. If you want to save on lockpicks, most doors can be hacked down with a big enough axe. You can get to a lot of secret areas that other games would’ve blocked off with invisible walls by climbing and jumping. I was able to skip a huge boss fight by challenging a terrifying zombie guy to a drinking contest and, thanks to having a high enough Constitution score, I goaded him into drinking himself to death while I was still roaring for more. This is a world that will rarely tell you, ""No,"" if you wonder if something is possible. And you can even bring up to three friends along with their own custom characters in co-op, both online and on the couch. I was impressed with how smooth and seamless this experience was, as joining or leaving a session regardless of where in the campaign your friends are is very easy, and I never ran into any significant connection issues or other online hiccups – though I’ve definitely seen reports that other people have. Given how complex Baldur's Gate 3 is, that's impressive. It only gets better, and funnier, when you realize you can have one person distract a guard by talking to them while the other steals everything that's not nailed down behind their back. There's a huge amount of freedom in who you can be in this world, as well. This character creator is one of the best I've seen outside of MMOs in a long time, featuring 29 different subraces with unique abilities and models (if you count all the different colors of dragonborn, at least). Each of the 12 classes have at least three specializations that play quite differently, with wizards and clerics getting even more to choose from. And I just love the art direction on every humanoid, enemy, and even the outfits. I've rarely experienced so much joy just looking at the beautiful, flame-haired elven ranger I designed outside of Final Fantasy XIV. It's not just the static model, either. The variety of high-fidelity, performance-captured, expressive faces everyone can make is shockingly good for a game of this type, with hundreds of characters rather than a small, core cast who can be directed like they're in a live-action production such as The Last of Us. There's not a bit of awkward lip-syncing to be found. Larian’s incredible attention to detail also extends to the area design and writing. That’s exemplified by the city of Baldur's Gate itself, a hub full of life and adventure that came around to awe me anew, even though it took me 90 hours to reach the titular setting. Almost every citizen you’ll encounter there has something to say about the unfolding events, and nosey exploration is consistently rewarded with new lore, new loot, and new quests. It's downright astounding how much voice acting Larian has crammed into these streets, and how good nearly all of it is. There are dozens of random gossipers on street corners who are just as enthusiastically and professionally portrayed as the main cast, and rarely sound too similar to each other. I assume many of the actors involved must be responsible for more than one of these bit parts, but I can't tell just by listening like I can in some areas of Skyrim.  First among this delightful cast are your companions, a motley crew of multilayered, interestingly flawed characters who both grow and sometimes regress over the course of the campaign. The cheerful, eager tiefling Karlach, who has basically a demonic bomb instead of a heart, quickly became my best friend. I had flings with the dour cleric Shadowheart, the arrogant wizard Gale, and yes, the stoic Halsin, who can turn into a grizzly bear, among other creatures. There are plenty more where they came from, and they all have elaborate background stories and the capacity to significantly grow and change. The main villains, about whom I will spoil as little as possible, are just as richly written, with complex motives and their own individual brands of malice that inject new and greater threats into the last third of this epic-length adventure. I also really enjoyed Larian's approach to romance. Years of Mass Effect memes have proven that it's almost impossible to make 3D video game sex that's actually, well, sexy, and Baldur’s Gate 3 hasn’t changed the game there. We're just not there yet, as a society. Instead of trying to do that and failing badly, they build a lot of the magic into sensual wordplay, and most of the carnal encounters you can engage in are either really funny (I mean, everyone's seen the bear scene, right?), or serve more broadly to tell you something new about your partner, how they see the world, and what they value rather than simply flashing what’s underneath their armor. That's so much better than showing two naked elves awkwardly humping over some unintentionally laughable mood music like you're Dark Helmet making his action figures kiss. When it was time to put our clothes back on and roll for initiative in combat, Baldur's Gate 3 never failed to impress me with the care and thoughtfulness with which the encounter design was set up to torture me. It's like each one is carefully crafted to make me want to scream at the Dungeon Master, ""You bastard!"" And I mean that in the best possible way. One fight involved teleporting imp creatures who garrote my party members before carting them off to separate locations, preventing spellcasting and forcing everyone to fend for themselves. The next might be against some terrifying insectoids who leave everyone literally petrified with fear, so I have to find a way to win without being able to move. The AI can be cunning and savage, especially on the top-level tactician difficulty. At no point have I been able to fall back on a repetitive, grinding routine. You think on your feet or you die and reload your latest quicksave.  The learning curve is helped somewhat by a clean and readable UI that lets you press T when hovering over any creature, object, or key phrase in a tooltip to get more information. It's not helped, however, by a pretty inadequate set of tutorials that takes a lot of knowledge about D&amp;D for granted. I know 5th Edition well enough that it didn't really trip me up, but I can definitely see where others would completely overlook some critical concepts like how saving throws tied to specific attributes work, and Baldur's Gate 3 doesn't care to explain them in detail. You can get by without some of this knowledge, especially on the lower difficulty, but you certainly won't master combat without it. You could benefit a lot from reading the 5E Player's Handbook before you get started, but Larian shouldn't expect that of you. Your character and companions also take some time and experience to develop as effective killers, and the first four levels or so can feel unnecessarily brutal due to how fragile you are when you start out. That's mostly a product of adapting 5th Edition D&amp;D so closely, and Larian’s designers didn’t take it upon themselves to correct this long-running problem from the tabletop. They do, however, often give you ways to even the odds or avoid combat if you're clever – you’ll do well to watch the environment for things like heavy objects hanging from a destructible thread above your enemies, or prep for combat by finding some isolated guards and kicking them over a railing while no one is looking. But once my party got beefed up with five levels worth of upgrades and some magic items, I was happily blasting, slashing, and shooting my way through fights using all of the versatile abilities and environmental options at my disposal. My favorite pair of boots let me teleport to anywhere I could see once per day (something normally restricted to the magical classes,) which was extremely helpful for setting up my ranger in inaccessible areas with a commanding view of the battlefield. I took out some of the later bosses much more easily than I would have in a head-to-head fight simply because there was nothing stopping me from having two invisible wizards walk right up in broad daylight and hit them in the face with Disintegrate before they even knew what was happening.   The story spans over three acts that each took me around 40 hours to complete, playing like an obsessive completionist and finishing as many side objectives as I could. Each has a very distinct vibe and look, aided by an evocative and lively soundtrack. Act 1 is mostly idyllic wilderness, Act 2 is the spooky part, and Act 3 treats us to dense, urban adventuring. It can feel a bit slow at times, since the first act had me chasing down several different leads to solve the same problem, and Act 2 presents more questions than it answers right up until the final set of confrontations. But discovering exciting new areas, strong side quest writing, and those consistently fun combat encounters meant I never lost motivation. The really amazing thing was not how big Baldur's Gate 3 is, though. Much has been made of its scope, but I would honestly not have minded if it were around half as long as it is. No, the magic is in how almost none of it feels like filler, no matter how far from the main quest you stray. Every random house I wandered into or side quest I picked up rewarded me with a memorable, unique, handcrafted roleplaying experience. Even a random note found on the body of a bandit might tell a heartbreaking story about their past, which gives weight to every decision to fight and kill. It’s all there for a reason. And while the first two acts have plenty of difficult choices, the big ones I had to make before committing to a final plan of action in Act 3 are a work of devilish genius. Without spoiling anything, realizing my enemies were so many steps ahead of me by the time I reached the city was heartbreaking, but I still felt empowered by the opportunities that remained to alter my own destiny and assemble a truly impressive coalition of allies. Impressively, the last stretch often called back to things I did and characters I saved 80 hours ago, which tied the whole tale together and made the world feel even more authentic. This is not a story that takes for granted that you are a hero; it's one that truly stares you down and demands that you prove it, if that's really what you're made of. The lead up to the finale backed me into a corner with a dozen ways out, but each one would require me to compromise on what I believe in in one way or another. This elevates the tension and the storytelling to new heights, which is impressive given how strong it’d been up to that point. There were quests that made me cry, quests that made me yell, ""What?!"" out loud, and quests that genuinely creeped me out. And the variations in not only the ending, but also so many other smaller stories, have me eager to play it all over again. And that's really saying something, when Baldur's Gate 3 has been my full-time job for the last three weeks. It does need to be called out for some mild to moderate bugs here and there – nothing that stopped me in my tracks, of course, but enough to be annoying. There were also performance issues in Act 3 that required me to turn my settings down, even with an RTX 3080. But we’ve already seen many of the worst offenders addressed with the four hotfixes that’ve come out since launch, and what remains feels almost trivial next to the greatness of everything else. A game this complex will always have its share of bugs, especially at launch, and what I experienced was a more than acceptable tradeoff.  I don't want to say every CRPG going forward should aspire to be like Baldur's Gate 3. Not everything needs to be nearly this big and ambitious, or even this dense. But it is a landmark moment in the genre, and if I had to point to one paragon that I would like everyone else making these to take inspiration from, this is absolutely it. I waited 14 years for the stars to align again so that we could get the ideal mix of crunchy, tactical, old-school RPG combat, an epic and well-written story with complex characters and lots of meaningful choices, and a level of polish and cinematic presentation that let me see the sweat and the sorrow on characters' faces in their darkest hours. Plenty of other games have partially completed that list, but the last time they all came together was Dragon Age: Origins in 2009. And I can finally say that game, and its Infinity Engine predecessors, have a worthy successor that’s not just matched their RPG greatness, but surpassed it. Baldur’s Gate 3 is just about everything I could have asked for. "
Blasphemous 2 ,8,"You know those circus performers who contort their bodies in terrifying ways for our squeamish amusement? Blasphemous 2 is a lot like those gifted weirdos – impressive and mesmerizing in that “I just can’t look away” kind of way that’s best watched between the fingers covering your grimacing face. While this sequel definitely doesn’t break any ground in the world of 2D Metroidvanias that the original didn’t, the unique and fantastic art, music, style, and story make an otherwise orthodox adventure extremely memorable. An awesome new arsenal of weapons and an increased focus on platforming and light puzzles make this 14-hour odyssey a lot less repetitive than its predecessor, too.   From the jump, you’ll hack and slash your way through some absolutely beautiful (and discomforting) 2D hallways filled with horrific monsters, perform life-threatening feats of platforming prowess, and go up against bosses so unsettling that not even their detail-obscuring pixel art style can save you from the night terrors that are sure to follow. Upgrading your character’s weapons and health and magic meters, while collecting various passive buffs and spells make for a fantastic climb to unparalleled power, and by the end I looked and felt the part of the ultimate unholy warrior. Little of that hasn’t been done before, but Blasphemous 2 looks quite spectacular standing proud atop the shoulders of giants that came before. The thing that really sets it apart is its extremely unnerving art, story, and characters, all of which are so frightfully memorable they elevate the by-the-numbers blueprint, fueled by whatever the body horror equivalent of charm is. Even by the high standards of the first Blasphemous (which came out in 2019), the sequel is both revolting and gorgeous, with all-too-detailed death animations. There’s one where a flock of owls tear a defeated enemy to pieces, and another where a devout slug monster pops open like a pus-filled blister. It’s all set against breathtaking levels, like one dungeon that takes place in a giant, upside down castle made of wax. That fantastic level of detail is often used against you to disturbing effect, as you’re subjected to some of the most repulsive stuff ever to warrant a good, ol’ fashioned eyeball bleaching. There’s one character I had to interact with more than I cared to who progressively had her skin ripped off throughout the adventure as she helped my character get stronger, and another guy who kept squirting wax out of his breast into the mouth of a giant infant. Seriously, this is one of the grossest games I’ve ever played – which, of course, is a compliment in this context. The story continues the violent and often convoluted trials of The Penitent One, the last living member of an order that’s trying to put an end to the abominations born from a godlike phenomenon known as The Miracle. It’s easy to become confused and left behind by this complicated tale of guilt and religion gone wrong, especially since it’s often told using archaic Old English words spoken from the mouths of cryptic, half-insane characters moments before they devour their own limbs or something unhinged like that. But (and it’s admittedly an enormous but) if you stick with it, roll with the disquieting punches, and maybe read a few item descriptions every now and again, that story is actually really good, even if it did increase my pre-existing fear of churches by 70%. Where its predecessor focused almost solely on combat, Blasphemous 2 spends an equal amount of time testing your reflexes with increasingly demanding platforming sections that do wonders to break up the action. That’s accomplished using the three new weapons that you’re introduced to as a replacement to the Mea Culpa (which was your only option during The Penitent One’s first crusade), all of which come with their own clever movement abilities. My personal favorite, the War Sensor, is a powerful flail that lets you smack bells to reveal hidden platforms and open blocked passageways for a limited time; it also just has a long reach and deals a lot of damage, which I’m a fan of. There’s also the lightning-fast rapier and dagger that let you dash through nifty mirrors to move quickly and pass through certain otherwise-impassable barriers, and finally the well-rounded Praying Blade that lets you do a downward strike that destroys enemies and sturdy obstructions alike. Since you can instantaneously switch between the holy trinity that is your arsenal, many sections require skillful use of multiple weapons to navigate an area without falling to your death, and certain weapons are better suited for killing different enemies. You might start taking out enemies with your giant flail, then use it to hit a bell to reveal some hidden platforms, before switching to your rapier to dash through some magical mirrors before launching a flurry of quick jabs from your blade. Stringing together awesome maneuvers like that made me feel like an absolute badass, and is a huge step up from only having access to the fairly milquetoast Mea Culpa from the first game. A creepy and unsettling action-platformer, Blasphemous has an eery atmosphere, gorgeous pixel art, and intricate animations that never fail to impress. The combat can be satisfying, but relies too heavily on memorization, which makes backtracking through its non-linear world eventually turn stale. And while the visual variety at least keeps things looking fresh, superfluous and poorly implemented upgrade mechanics keep Blasphemous from having the amount of depth seen in many other games across the genre. It’s still an enjoyable Metroidvania, just not an all that memorable one. <i>– Steven Petite, September 9, 2019</i Read the full <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/09/blasphemous-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Blasphemous reivew</a  One area that hasn’t improved all that much, though, is the enemy variety, which remains fairly weak from area to area. Usually after a few sections in one level you’ll have seen the two or three new enemy types and be forced to take out the same bunch of sickos repeatedly until you finally reach the boss. It can be especially irritating when some enemies spam attacks that require patience before you can fight back, meaning you’ll find yourself standing around waiting for an enemy to finish breathing fire for a few seconds before you can counter with a few hits before waiting some more. There’s also a whole bunch of repeat enemies who change their color and element of their attacks, but are essentially identical to the guys you’ve been killing for hours already, like the big knights who have a buttload of health and slowly swing at you with their massive blunt objects. I really got sick of seeing those jerks every couple minutes. Thankfully, bosses are a lot more interesting than the minions who serve them, and each section features a big bad for you to take your frustration out on. Taking down an evil, usually disgusting boss is always a good time, though Blasphemous 2 definitely lacks the level of challenge I look for in my Metroidvanias (and there are no difficulty settings to crank up). In about half the cases I killed the area’s boss on my first try, with most of the other half falling on my second attempt once I’d gotten a peek at their moveset. As someone who really enjoys the trial and error of a good boss fight, I found myself somewhat disappointed that many of these climaxes concluded so quickly. Still, even when they ended abruptly, all the monsters you fight are creatively designed and memorable, like one where you face bullet hell against a priest who keeps switching faces, and another where a robot and his child sidekick team up to send you straight to the afterlife. Blasphemous 2 is an excellent Metroidvania and a marked improvement over the original, even if it did occasionally make me cancel my lunch plans with its grotesqueries. What it lacks in originality with its design it more than makes up for with its bizarre world, appalling story, and inspired look and sound. The new weapons and focus on platforming definitely helped sustain my enjoyment for the campaign’s sizable duration, even when underwhelming enemy variety and unchallenging bosses leave something to be desired. Its stomach-churning religious torture porn might be as far as you can get from the adorable world of Hollow Knight, but you’d be hard-pressed to find something better to play while you continue your interminable wait for Silksong. "
Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew ,9,"What do you get with a talking ghost ship staffed by a quirky found family of zombies and run by a literal skeleton crew? That sounds like a setup for a Guybrush Threepwood zinger, but it’s actually the good guys in Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew. This outstanding stealth tactics game has you managing teams of magic-infused undead pirates on their mission to find a lost treasure, serve justice, fulfill their last regrets, and outwit the skeletal monkey that terrorizes their ship. The developers at Mimimi have delivered a sense of humor that drives the plot, wonderful visual and level design, and a cast of ne'er-do-wells diverse in both abilities and function. All of that means Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew sets sail as perhaps the finest stealth tactics game ever made, charting a course for the genre's future that's brighter than ever.   Controlling a team of three pirates in real time, your job is to fulfill a few stealthy mission objectives on island maps thick with enemies, civilians, and set piece features. Every one of the eight different islands is an example of the diorama-type design that Mimimi has become known for from Desperados 3 and its Shadow Tactics games. Each of them is a moving tapestry of not just pretty scenery, but stealth puzzles for you to solve and ingenious knots of patrol routes and stationary guards to tactically unravel. It's also by far the most accessible game I've ever played in this genre, with varied mission times allowing shorter play sessions and a lot of easily tweaked difficulty settings broken down by category. On a basic level, Shadow Gambit follows in the footsteps of the Commandos games: you maneuver your hand-picked crew around in real-time strategy style, using their powers to evade, outwit, and take down guards before (often hilariously) hiding their bodies in convenient bushes and the like. It’s not fully real-time, in that you can also use shadow mode to pause, give an order to each of your crew, and then unpause to execute those commands all at the same time for slick-looking stealth takedowns and rushes using your whole team's powers at once. You do all that in service of your mission in the Lost Caribbean, a magical island chain in an alternate version of our own world's golden age of piracy. This is a strange place, one where the dead rest uneasy and some return to life as undead Cursed – and are inevitably forced into a life of piracy by the Inquisition of the Burning Maiden. That might make it seem like you're the bad guys, but trust me: the Inquisition are zealous jerks. Take as evidence that nonviolent civilians are perfectly happy with your rotting crew murdering the inquisition and never once snitch on you for it. It's a setting tailor made for rip-roaring, high-seas adventure, which is just what Shadow Gambit provides.  The frame of the story is simple – a quest to revive the legendary ghost ship Red Marley – but the tales told within it and the characters that act them out are delightful. I was a bit lost in the world’s details at first, but after plowing ahead for a bit I found a lot of delight in the vicious and decidedly unhinged Inquisitor villain, as well as the pirate mythology and deeply strange worldbuilding Shadow Gambit kept throwing at me even hours into the 25ish-hour campaign. Each island is a place you visit more than once, and they’re intricate enough to justify that. Take Angler's Bay, a ramshackle town built on an island where a massive, magical leviathan was drawn onto land and slain. The level itself has distinct areas you learn to love or avoid, and those are miniature challenges in and of themselves – the graveyard is one, the open sightlines of the docks another, and the dense, multi-level slums a third. Know your mission is going to go to the docks? Bring a crew that can swim. The slums? One that's good at moving up and down the rooftops. It's telling that the only real flaw in Shadow Gambit I feel compelled to call out is where it could have reached further, but didn't. For example, some levels change depending on the mission, and every map has a daytime and nighttime version that play differently – strategies like putting out a torch obviously don't work during the day. Despite that, I did find myself wanting slightly more dynamic responses from the enemies – I’m not even talking about something on the level of IOI's Hitman series, but it'd be nice if the enemy deployed extra patrols or was just a bit more cautious after finding dead bodies around.  The tools available to you while you play are a remarkable feat of game design that make it difficult to go back to any other stealth tactics game. You can quickly and easily highlight interactables and guards with a single button. You can see the view cone of any given guard, which is easily understandable as either striped for partial vision or filled for full sight. The most useful of all is the ability to tell exactly who can see a given location or character, drawing a yellow line between their eyes and the spot in question. I never felt like I didn't have the information I needed to make a plan, and that’s an empowering sensation that's at the heart of a good stealth tactics experience. You may not have the feeling of really being there as the mission goes down as you might in a first or third-person game, but you're still planning and executing the heists, assassinations, and intelligence gathering. It's a mastermind simulator, one that creates the illusion of being an incredibly clever planner even when you mess up so badly you've got to reload a save and try again. Part of that's down to the fact that, without spoiling anything, the act of quicksaving and reloading is an in-universe power that characters comment on. Incorporating save scumming into the game design pays dividends in the moment-to-moment play because, even when I had a few moments where I forgot to save for a while and had to redo a big chunk of a level, the sheer options available to tackle a scenario make replaying them a lot less repetitious than it can be in other games.  The eight characters available are each uniquely designed and delightfully voice acted. Each character has their own storyline, both in the form of a mission or three and in goofy side stories aboard the Red Marley itself that take place between other missions. I was a pretty big fan of those, working as they did to flesh out the crew, the ship, and the personalities behind each pirate. Desperados 3 is an uncompromising tactical stealth game that tests your patience and rewards your willingness to experiment. Playing with a charming team of toy soldier-sized assassins in a series of deadly and detailed dioramas is tough and requires a lot of trial and error, but success is more rousing than a whiskey chaser. Dormant for 14 years, in Desperados 3 the series enjoys the most triumphant comeback in the Western genre since Clint Eastwood made Unforgiven. <i>– Tristan Ogilvie, June 12, 2020</i Read the full <a href=""/desperados-2019-ps4/37238/review/desperados-3-review"">Desperados 3 review</a  Just as importantly, every one of them behaves slightly differently, from attack speed to whether or not they can swim or climbing, and they each have two unique abilities from the start and are later bolstered by an unlockable upgrade or third power. For instance, our navigator Afia has the power to blink-teleport and freeze guards in time, ship's doctor Suleidy's botanical prowess lets her sprout instant cover, and the noble Pinkus von Presswald can use ghostly possession to take control of an enemy.  My favorite, though, is Mr. John Mercury, the ship's carpenter. He's a jolly lad who loves to sing, drink, hang out with his fish Sir Reginald, and do otherwise righteously piratical stuff. He's also able to sink into a nether-dimension and drag enemies down with him. A handy power, especially when Sir Reginald pops out to distract baddies for you.  Also up there is Gaelle, the Red Marley's master of cannons, whose magical gun can suck up and launch other characters – good or bad. She's a great example of where Shadow Gambit encourages you to use its variety of strange powers to break its scenarios: Gaelle can just shoot people up walls, skipping entire chunks of levels or bypassing the puzzle around taking down a guard on a tower. Her cannon-based melee attack upgrade is also the source of one of the funniest single animations I've seen in a video game: She just shoves it down over a target’s entire body.  In a further brilliant move emphasizing character variety, Shadow Gambit has a system to ensure you don't get too comfortable with any given crew composition. Each mission earns points toward new upgrades, and the longer a crew member has been out of rotation the more bonus points you get when you finally cash it in and bring them out on a job.  The end of the story, let me be clear, isn't the end of the fun. After you beat the campaign proper you're able to keep going to replay missions and finish skipped sidequests, as well as reveal a full list of all the hidden achievements and challenges to hunt down in missions. I enjoyed all that so much that I spent another 10 hours just fooling around in missions I'd previously done to try out challenges and alternate paths – always the mark of a good stealth game – and I'm definitely going back for more secrets and unlocks. Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew is a peak example of the stealth tactics genre from a studio that is clearly mastering its craft. Its mission structure is spread across excellently entertaining levels with rich detail to find and master, while characters shine with voice performances, endearing humor, and colorful art that both delight and impress. With innumerable ways to approach its levels and an extremely smart integration of the practice of saving and reloading into the world’s fiction, it’s firing on all cylinders in all categories except perhaps enemy AI. Frankly, I don't know anyone I wouldn't recommend it to. "
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre: The Game ,6,"Perhaps as an ode to the horror movie genre itself, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre starts out with all the same joy and promise of a group of friends preparing for a weekend at a cabin in the woods before things quickly take a turn for the worse. While I definitely enjoyed plenty of my 20 hours with this novel take on the asymmetrical multiplayer blueprint, where three powerful murderers hunt down a team of four elusive teens, getting started wasn’t as smooth as it is in similar games and there’s less to do than expected once you’re up and running. Between that and some seriously frustrating technical issues, there was definitely a chloroform-doused wet blanket over the whole thing.   If you’ve played any asymmetrical horror game, be that Dead By Daylight or Friday the 13th, Evil Dead or Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed (among others), then you’ve already got a pretty good idea how developer Gun Interactive’s The Texas Chain Saw Massacre works, to the point where it feels extremely familiar at first, right down to borrowed ideas like quicktime events and minigames to do things like turn on generators and pick locks, and hiding from baddies who can’t be killed. But it also includes some important distinctions that help separate it (at least a little bit) from its peers, the biggest of which is that instead of a group of survivors running from one psychopath, there’s a whole team of psychopaths working together to entrap and eliminate their high school-aged quarry. It’s still lopsided at three killers vs four victims, but that adjustment has pretty substantial implications on the asymmetrical horror recipe, since now both sides require communication and teamwork to achieve victory. In other games, it can certainly feel unfair when one side requires a whole group of people to know what they’re doing and work together to pull off a win, while the other can handily lone wolf it and kill everyone without breaking a sweat. I certainly enjoyed preying on uncoordinated groups of survivors in Evil Dead: The Game last year, but I gotta admit – sometimes steamrolling everyone felt a tad mean. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre makes things a lot more balanced by making the family of killers only marginally more powerful than the teens they’re hunting, as well as being slightly outnumbered by them. The bad guys are still unkillable and will absolutely wail on their targets in open conflict, but without all of that raw power concentrated into one monster, cooperation is required to pull off a win no matter which team you’re playing for – and that makes things a lot more interesting. Each member of the murder-loving Family has modest but useful abilities, like Johnny’s power to track footprints in a handy detective vision mode, or the Hitchhiker's ability to place traps that leave survivors frozen in place. I favor Cook, whose slothlike movement and weak attacks are offset by his incredible hearing and ability to padlocks doors to slow the Victims’ progress; basically, I become the ultimate irritating groundskeeper while my friends do most of the killing, which doesn’t sound all that glorious but you can’t argue with my stack of bodies.   Victims, in turn, have some pretty substantial and interesting ways to fight back or speed along their escape, like how Leland can use his jock body and tiny brain to shoulder-charge his pursuers, stunning them for a good while, or how Sonny can mark members of the Family, revealing them through walls for everyone to see, which helps the survivors stay one step ahead. My personal favorite on this side is Connie, whose incredible lockpicking skills allow me to break into areas extremely quickly. That both counters my own tactics while playing as Cook and also lets me lead my team to an escape at an unbelievable pace – sometimes I was able to get out before the bad guys even had a chance to form a plan of their own. The Victims can also do cool things like sneak attack the psychopaths with a makeshift bone knife or burst out of a hiding place to stun them for a time, or even grapple their attackers in a quick-time button-spamming contest to fend them off for a bit. Even with those good ideas working in its favor, though a lot of wind is taken out of it by some pretty egregious technical issues that everyone I played with experienced, every single match. The biggest one is that anytime a Victim and a member of the Family get into close proximity, and especially when they engage in combat with one another, the framerate takes a nosedive for everybody in the match. It’s not unplayable, but the most tense moments are frustrating to play, since you might lose track of someone you’re chasing due to massive frame hitching or, even if you do kill someone, you don’t get to enjoy your victory to its fullest because even the kill animation is choppy. Texas Chainsaw Massacre fails to redefine Leatherface's legacy any better than the sequels and remakes it leaves in the rearview. Those who only value slashers based on their body count and murderous creativity might give this pure guts, no glory slasher a pass. Otherwise, 2003's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre does ""dark and gritty"" better. Almost every other entry that features a freakshow family affair proves why Leatherface needs his Sawyers or Hewitts. Texas Chainsaw Massacre stinks like a basement full of corpses as Leatherface becomes just another hulking villain — not exactly the fresh start franchise diehards might have otherwise welcomed. <i>– Matt Donato, February 18, 2022</i Score: 5 Read the full <a href=""/the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-reboot/53976/review/texas-chainsaw-massacre-review"">Texas Chainsaw Massacre review</a This bug was so common, in fact, that our team actually began to use the framerate dip as a callout – whenever we noticed massive lag and hitching we’d all start shouting, “Uh-oh! Who’s in trouble? Where are you at?” I’ve never seen such a reliable dip in performance before, and the fact that it was so consistent that it had an impact on our strategy is both hilarious and sad. Beyond that, there’s also mid-game disconnects that’ll ruin your match, and some weird issues when trying to gather a party together. Our friends would get error messages when trying to group up, forcing us to spend whole blocks of time troubleshooting before we could even start a match. I even had one match where my character just became frozen in place indefinitely, forcing me to back out of the session (with no option to rejoin). It’s always hard to say how painful issues like these will be in the days and weeks after launch, but even with the much smaller player pools during the review period where I knew that everybody was playing on good PCs with reliable connections it was almost always an unstable experience, and that doesn’t seem like a good sign. The good news is that, even with rocky technical performance putting a damper on things, each match has a compelling back-and-forth where survivors work to avoid notice and find a way out of the death trap they’re stuck in, and maniacs keep the pressure on and lock down the level as much as possible until they can eliminate their captives. The Family definitely has the more engaging set of objectives, since they’re not only hunting the survivors but setting traps and adding additional obstacles to the mix, like turning on generators that activate electrical barriers that then have to be turned off by the Victims. But they also spend their time leveling up their patriarch, Grandpa, who drinks blood you collect from Victims and find in the environment, and as he gains in power it becomes increasingly easier to detect where the remaining survivors are in the process.  Naturally, setting the perfect trap for your prey and then slowly closing in for the kill is an exceeding thrill, especially when my traps forced someone to jump out of a window in desperation, killing themselves on my behalf. Moments like that allowed me to embrace my inner sadist and put a smile on my face. Victims, on the other hand, mostly rely on stealth to complete their pretty boring objectives, all of which are permutations of the same thing: open a door somewhere so you can leave. Sometimes that’s as easy as finding a few lockpicks and opening a couple doors to leave, especially if your pursuers are doing a bad job of herding you away from it, but there are a few slightly more complicated options like using one exit that opens on a timer when you fix a pressure valve, and another that opens up a tunnel exit when you solve a simple circuitry puzzle at a fuse box. Thankfully, despite the uncreative errands you have to complete to escape, it’s still undoubtedly a good time cooperating with your fellow Victims and narrowly avoiding detection by the bad guys, or better yet: making it out of the final exit by the skin of your teeth with all three murderers hot on your heels. With such a good baseline, it’s pretty disappointing that there are only three maps and a single game mode to choose from, each with only the most minor of permutations from match to match. The Gas Station, The Family House, and The Slaughterhouse are all varied and well-designed maps in terms of layout, but they bizarrely all have the same set of four exits in the same general places for Victims to escape through and Family to guard. Once you’ve played a level once or twice, all the novelty of emerging from the basement to an unfamiliar area that you then need to escape is lost, and it’s super weird that there isn’t any special way for me to escape The Slaughterhouse versus The Family House. You’re telling me that both of these places have exactly one pressure-released exit <i>and </i>one tunnel exit with a broken fuse box? That just feels like it was copied and pasted. It’s also pretty odd that there’s no real tutorial or single-player with bots mode to be found, leaving little recourse for those learning the ropes or trying to sharpen their skills. The only way to learn the rules without playing is by watching an extensive library of extremely dry videos, only a couple of which even bother with voiceover explanations, leaving you to read for like 30 minutes and then hope you have a great memory. Since most people probably won’t have the stomach for that and will jump right into playing matches, you’ll likely encounter lots of players who don’t know what they’re doing, which can be an extremely frustrating experience when they’re on your team – and they’re not even that satisfying to kill. Since I’d gone to the trouble of reading everything and played 20 hours worth of matches in just a few days, I had the privilege of guiding my teammates to frequent victories, but every once in a while I’d find someone without a mic who would just ruin my day.   In one match, one of my fellow murderers was a mic-less novice who kept opening locked doors and leaving them wide open for Victims to slip through, which of course they did, costing us the match. I couldn’t tell him that he was screwing us over, so I had to split my time between finding the Victims and closing doors behind my clueless teammate. Those matches were very much not a fun experience, and felt like it could have been easily avoided with a simple tutorial like you see in other similar games. Without that, I predict lots of matches will be ruined, with frustrated veterans losing patience with their newbie teammates and quitting the match early. Hopefully they’ll be incentivized to stick around because playing matches earns you XP that can be used to level up your characters. It’s typical stuff like improvements to your stats so you do things like take more damage, increase your stamina meter, or collect more blood to feed your creepy grandparent. There’s also a pretty extensive skill tree and loadout system that allow you to customize your characters to alter how their signature abilities work and give some helpful perks, like the ability to detect lockpicks in your vicinity in the opening moments of a match as a Victim. So even when most of the novelty of the single game mode wears thin, at least there’s something to keep people around.  You’ll also unlock cosmetic outfits for each character that add some nice flair and probably make you easier to spot while hiding, but hey, you can’t put a price on swagger. I also have to give credit for how much love for the original 1974 movie has been packed into this thing, from faithfully recreated characters to tons of behind-the-scenes photos that can be unlocked and browsed while in the main menu. They even got Kane Hodder, the stuntman who portrayed Leatherface in one of the movies, to do motion capture for the iconic character in this! Those are all such nice, authentic touches for longtime fans looking to nerd out. I have little doubt that in a year or two, when they’ve added more scenarios and maps, fixed the most pressing technical issues, and maybe thought up a better way for newcomers to learn how to play, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre will become a staple in my growing asymmetrical horror games library. For now, however, my recommendation comes with a lot of caveats. While the less lopsided take on the asymmetrical horror format definitely works, the shallow number of samey maps can get monotonous pretty quickly, and even with a fair number of playable characters and a solid progression system, I found myself way too comfortable with the three scenarios after just a few hours. Still, the potential behind this format and the reverence for the beloved horror classic it’s based on is clear, even when it does feel a tad half-baked coming out the gates. "
Atlas Fallen ,7,"I keep wanting to love Atlas Fallen. I mean, it’s a delightful Prince of Persia-inspired open-world action RPG with big ideas, big monsters, and even bigger weapons to fight them with, so it’s got that going for it. And I did enjoy myself as I explored each of its four unique zones, which stretch as far as the eye can see and deliver some mouthwatering, if kinda washed out, vistas. After spending about 18 hours with its mix of respectable monster slaying and brisk platforming, I can comfortably say it’s a <i>good</i> time – especially if you bring a friend into its seamless drop-in co-op. At the same time, its C-tier story is so campy and bone-dry – in both writing and character performance – that it’s clear Atlas has fallen a notch or two.   The middling story, which centers around a generic clash between a human rebellion and a tyrannical regime, starts out rough. No, there are relatively few bugs and the opening is pretty short – I mean, like, <i>physically</i> rough for my custom avatar, a rugged yet scholarly desert dweller. After a few introductory conversations with other desert dwellers in the first area, it was promptly implied that he’d been blasted in the face with a whole bunch of sand and left for dead before the opening cutscene, which kinda sucks considering his indentured servitude as one of the Unnamed. That’s the bottom caste of Atlas Fallen’s sand-strewn medieval world – which, as we learn through some apocalyptic mumbo jumbo narration – is ruled by an evil sun god named Thelos and ravaged by giant sand monsters called wraiths. This is a pretty cool setup, but the execution of the plot that follows is thinner than the middle of an hourglass. For example, poorly synced lip movements and unenthusiastic voice acting sap the life out of cutscenes. On top of that, there’s no action in any of them, so they’re pretty dull – and each of Atlas’ major characters is a cardboard cutout with no personality to speak of. You’ve got the generic thief with the heart of gold, the upstanding knight girl who introduces herself by punching said golden-hearted thief in the face (but secretly has a soft spot the whole time,) and Nyaal, the <i>other</i> sun god. He spends his waking hours talking at you while looking like a knockoff of <a href=""/avatar-the-way-of-water/62508/review/avatar-the-way-of-water-review"">Jake Sully from Avatar</a>, but more importantly, he inhabits the magical gauntlet at the center of the story which gives you your powers and a new hope for the rebellion against Thelos and his imperialist thugs. Unfortunately, <i>this</i> sun god is always there with you and rarely shuts up.  Luckily, if you can ignore all that, it’s relatively easy to see Atlas Fallen’s joy as an online co-op adventure where you and a friend run around a sprawling open world battling monsters. It’s a well-crafted map, with plenty of opportunity to unearth rare treasures, build up powerful characters, fight big monsters, do a little platforming – or just chill out and collect cosmetics for the excellent transmogrification system to your heart’s content. It balances simplicity and depth so expertly that it’s easily one of the best games to share between two online friends since It Takes Two.  That’s especially true when you get into the rhythm of the open questing system: this game lets you complete side-quests and interstitials between major story events separately while enjoying the same rewards – even when you’re across the world from one another. Given just how many main story quests scatter you to the wind in search of hidden gauntlet pieces, it’s fantastic to be able to freely split up and cover more ground – who knows, your friend might find something you missed instead of making you run around in circles or backtrack by yourself. That said, it’s a missed opportunity that couch co-op is nowhere to be found, and it’s thoroughly disappointing there’s no cross-play to let you and your buddies on other platforms team up. It’s clear that the main quest is paced around unlocking new mechanics rather than telling a good story. Atlas Fallen spreads its story across four open-world maps, such as the underground fortress of Bastengar and the crater-filled Wildlands, each of which carries a distinct vibe and is packed with enough hidden treasure and decently rewarding side-quests to feel like there’s always something new to find.  Fetch quests make up the bulk of it, with Nyaal frequently asking you to “find three shards” to complete the latest relic and achieve the next major gauntlet upgrade. But I didn’t feel like I needed to work overly hard to find each of the scattered components, and the rewards were always worthwhile. For instance, unlocking the triple air dash was a game-changer that let me reach distant ledges, and Reveal lets you manipulate ancient artifacts that reveal hidden platforming challenges you didn’t even know were there.  Both of these new abilities unlock previously inaccessible areas, giving all four zones extra room to breathe and slowly unravel themselves to those willing to backtrack. But Atlas Fallen doesn’t power-gate its best loot behind that kind of repeated searching, meaning you can choose to only do the main story, skip all that extra spelunking, and comfortably beat the rather underwhelming final boss without the added trouble.   That said, the one thing you can’t skip is sand. Your weapons are made of sand, you move around quickly by surfing across sand dunes, and each of the various monsters is literally made of sand. The only things not made of sand are the many anvils found dotted across the world of Atlas Fallen, which serve as places to save your game, upgrade your armor, and fast-travel to other anvils. Still, that’s a lot of sand in one land, let alone to conjure out of one hand – but there’s enough variety within this concept to not feel overly repetitive. Boss fights, quests, and random finds often give way to useful loot, armor, and Essence Stones that contribute to the deep customization and combat systems. Granted, many of these finds are cosmetic or simply merchant fodder with some bits of lore attached, but all the rare crafting items and Essence Dust (basically, Atlas’ version of experience points) make all that treasure-hunting feel worthwhile, even when there isn’t another powerful Essence Stone or armor piece around the next corner.  Meanwhile, power climb feels steady from start to finish – making combat encounters balanced as you venture into higher level zones, without making you grind for it – as long as you’re upgrading your armor, perks, Idols, Essence Stones, and Momentum Gauge at an anvil every so often. Those all help with a different aspect of character customization, but the main driver is your armor, which determines your character’s level and most of your combat stats like how much damage your attacks deal and how quickly your health can regenerate mid-combat. Speaking of combat, Atlas Fallen’s action-packed battles are simple but highly dynamic, thanks to a small number of moves that grow in power as you land hits. Fights center around two basic attacks that work differently based on the weapon you assign them to, but the twist is that your character’s movement style changes depending on which weapon you strike with. For instance, the sword-like Sandwhip homes in on an enemy from a distance before pushing you backward, letting you whip around the enemy mid-air if you dodge around mid-combo like Sora from Kingdom Hearts. Alternatively, the punchy Knuckledust lunges you forward as you pulverize your opponents with both hands. There are three of these, and they all encourage very different styles. Atlas Fallen also includes a deeply satisfying parry button, offering a generous window to counter enemy attacks, and a perfectly timed parry can turn the tides of any battle by freezing opponents. There’s also a two-handed slam attack that combines the styles of both equipped weapons, and you can top a chain of attacks off with an extremely powerful finishing move. That’s plenty to keep anyone busy in a typical encounter against a group of two or three large enemies like the marauding Tailguarder and the giant crab-like Shellbasher. And it’s a lot of fun to bring these bigger foes down piece by piece – it reminds me of hunting Rathalos across a vast desert in Monster Hunter. I’m delighted at how Atlas keeps a nice balance between its moment-to-moment smashing and slashing and its resource management systems. This is thanks to the Momentum Gauge, which fills up as you land direct hits and successful parries against enemies, gradually unlocking abilities you’ve slotted along the gauge. These collectable abilities make up the meat of Atlas Fallen’s customization, and they can be crafted, upgraded, and mixed and matched to build any sort of character you’d want – including healers, damage dealers, crowd controllers, tanks, you name it. One of my favorite Essence Stones is the Evasive Burst, which creates a shockwave after every dodge roll or air dash while active. This let me deal incredible amounts of damage while whipping around airborne foes with the Sandwhip. The catch is that it can be difficult to maintain high momentum since you receive more damage as your gauge reaches its limit. This risk and reward element keeps things interesting, since the strongest abilities sit on the upper end of the gauge, and it’s always tempting to unleash your highly gratifying finishing move to deal heavy damage at the cost of reducing your gauge to zero. It all comes together toward the end of the campaign, where every other fight has several enemy types filling the screen with lighting effects and clouds of yellowy dust – it’s kind of like the heavier moments of Doom Eternal, but with sand instead of viscera.  I’ve developed what I can best describe as a “love-hate” relationship with Atlas Fallen’s visual style. I’d often be wowed at how gorgeous some of its zones look – some of it made me feel as if I were standing inside a piece of elegant concept art. Especially once I’d unlocked my favorite suit of armor: Red Company, a suit that gleams brilliantly in direct sunlight as tufts of fabric unfurl around it. That looks fantastic on its own, but even better once I’ve dyed it with gold and blue dye I purchased from a traveling merchant. I’m also pleased that Atlas Fallen produces consistently high frames in the PS5’s Performance mode, but I’m not as impressed that it struggles with its fidelity even in Graphics mode – which is a shame because of how pretty and detailed its zones and armor designs are. Many of its animations are clunky, but what really bothers me is the compressed textures, low-quality models, and graininess that look flat-out ugly on my PS5 in both visual modes, as if I were playing a poorly made port of a Nintendo Switch game. Atlas looks much clearer on PC with none of the aforementioned compression issues, but its character models still evoke the uncanny valley more than most games. Atlas Fallen is a solid open-world action RPG with plenty of platforming and large monsters to fight. Putting aside its weak story and the console versions’ gritty graphics there’s a hidden gem of excellent combat, robust exploration, and surprisingly deep customization to uncover in the sinking sands of its arid wilderness. It’s slightly disappointing that co-op is online-only with no cross-play, but thanks to solid technical performance, it sticks in my mind as one of the better worlds I’ve explored with a friend lately.

F1 Manager 2023 ,8,"F1 Manager 2023 takes all the excitement of a race weekend and shifts the focus to behind the pit wall. If you’re a fan of the Codemasters F1 games, you know how stressful the tight turns on some of these street circuits are. I can't tell you how many times a qualifying lap has been ruined by a ""light touch"" of the wall at Monaco. In F1 Manager, that's not my problem; my only job is to tell the driver to watch their tires, fuel consumption, and about a dozen other metrics – on not just one F1 car, but two. F1 Manager 2023 fixes minor mistakes from the series debut last year and adds new ways to play, and it remains a compelling motorsports management simulation that’s committed to helping you grow both your knowledge and love of the sport. Juggling multiple metrics and managing a pair of the most elite race cars on the planet may sound overwhelming on paper but, in practice, everything feels like an opportunity to learn. And to help you learn, F1 Manager 2023 adds a brand new scenario mode called Race Replay. Race Replay features both full race replays and team-specific objectives for each track. The first moment I tried was a moment at Silverstone that required me to push both McLaren cars up to the podium after a yellow flag restart. It was the very first thing I played, so I was still trying to get my bearings. Despite the text of the challenge telling me that Norris needed to pit, I waited for about half a lap for Norris to suggest the pit stop himself. This resulted in him taking longer to get into the pits, but there was also a pit stop error – which resulted in Norris dropping to 10th position and causing me to fail the challenge. When I restarted, this time I immediately told him to pit as soon as the game let me. On this occasion there was no pit stop error and Norris held track position in fourth, making it very easy for him to overtake and win the challenge.  It’s this ability to A-B test your own actions that makes me feel like F1 Manager 2023 genuinely wants to teach the value of confident decision making and how crucial that is to becoming a world champion constructor. This ethos is the thing that shines brightest in F1 Manager, and is so inviting that I often find myself wanting to play Race Replay more often than the flagship career mode. If any of this sounds interesting, the deluxe edition of F1 Manager 2023 includes 14 additional race moments, including a scenario at the brand-new Las Vegas Grand Prix if you’re itching to see how it drives without simming most of a career season. That career mode allows you to take control of any of the ten teams on the grid and manage everything a team principal would. You have the ability to design car parts, build or upgrade team facilities, and manage the staff and drivers that work under you. You can even micromanage your pit crew and have them run drills as a unit to help cut down on errors and make them faster. All of these decisions end up producing confidence from your Board of Directors. Keep them happy, and you can manage your millions as you see fit – but if you’re unable to meet their demands, you may see yourself getting walking papers rather quickly. Which team you decide to manage will determine a lot about how detail oriented you need to be. Red Bull is not only flush with cash, but regularly cleans up race after race; even if you automate an entire weekend, they will do fine. This means that they can afford to take a long-term approach and aim for a locked-up championship at the halfway point of the season. Meanwhile, at the other end of the paddock, you have a team like Alpha Tauri (which, despite having good drivers, just has an outright lousy car). This means that they need to scrap and claw every weekend just to make it out of the first qualifying session. It’s this wide spectrum of challenge that makes F1 Manager stand out. Even if you manage to have a perfect relationship with your board and amass millions thanks to your sponsors, you’ll eventually run into the Cost Cap. The Cost Cap is a rule put in place so that teams can’t just dump billions into their teams. While it helps promote fairness, as each season has gotten longer and longer, even the top dogs like Red Bull and Mercedes have to be careful not to just burn through car parts. It means that in F1 Manager 2023, you always have to be making decisions. Sure, you can decide to save your money now and not upgrade your car parts, but that might cost you three races down the line. F1 Manager 2023 also makes sure to keep its authenticity intact by adding the two new tracks that were added to the 2023 calendar, as well as the sprint weekend format for six race weekends. These two simple additions make the strategy layer of career mode entirely different from last year. Sprint weekends forgo a practice session in order to run a shorter-distance race on Saturday for a crack at more constructor points. While it’s caused heated debate among F1 fans, it’s a perfect example of what makes F1 Manager stand out: it’s an opportunity to collect data and feel comfortable. F1 Manager also goes an additional step further than its Codemasters cousin by including not just F2 drivers but F3 as well. That said, drivers from these feeder categories were also available in F1 Manager 2022; I’d actually love to see this fleshed out more by letting you create custom drivers that you can sign and build from the ground up. Once you’re ready for a race weekend, you have three main mechanics to push the pace of your cars on track. Asking your driver to increase the heat on your tires will cause them to speed up, at the cost of literally burning rubber. Run your tires too long and too hard and you’ll turn a two-stop race into a three-stop race and likely force your driver and team out of the points. Managing your tires throughout an entire weekend can be difficult if you aren’t careful. Certain tracks are harder on tires than others; if you use up most of your soft tires in practice or qualifying, you might get stuck starting the race on a worn set. It’s an authentic juggling act. Fuel is a bit more straightforward. Ask the driver to keep his foot on the accelerator, and he’ll also have to hammer on the brake, thus burning more fuel. Because refueling is banned in F1, if you run out of fuel, you literally cannot finish a race. Once a race gets going, you have the ability to look at six different onboard cameras at low speed and a seventh camera that zooms all the way out and shows the entire track. This is the mandatory view if you choose to go any faster than 2x speed. You can go as fast as 16x speed. Be careful about using the first-person cameras at 2x speed; while I’ve<strong> </strong>never had any issue with motion sickness before, spending too much time at 2x forced me to stop playing for the night. I doubt it will be an issue for everyone, but it's something to keep an eye on. The Energy Recovery System (ERS) is the internal battery of the car that charges the engine and is, for me, the toughest part of the on-track mechanics to master. While F1 Manager 2023 thankfully doesn’t let you shoot yourself in the foot by draining the battery completely and shutting down the car, it does force you to go back to 1x speed when you hit zero. You can also give your individual drivers some very basic commands to shape their on-track behavior. While your AI drivers can do a decent enough job of overtaking and defending themselves, mastering when to issue these commands yourself can help you avoid getting stuck in the middle or back of the pack. However, it's slightly disappointing that there’s no way to design full team plans, like telling your A driver to swap positions with the B driver because the B driver has better pace. Drivers don’t have a relationship with each other but are simply there to take instructions. It stands out because team orders are a divisive but common facet of F1 authenticity, and it’s something missing from F1 Manager 2023. I hope it’s something Frontier can improve on in future games. Management games have always had a bit of difficulty deciding how to present themselves. Doubling down on intricate systems often means that developers can’t invest as much in stunning visual quality as their traditional sports game cousins. While it’s true that graphics aren’t necessarily at the forefront of Frontier’s focus, F1 Manager 2023 nonetheless looks pleasant in motion. That said, the studio’s level of achievements with this year’s audio is extremely commendable. Getting to hear real pit wall audio from the drivers is an absolute joy. Hearing my favorite driver, Yuki Tsunoda, swear at me after he dropped back to last place genuinely made me cackle – and took the sting out of a race weekend that was otherwise a failure. F1 Manager 2023 proves that Frontier isn’t one and done; it’s a championship contender. Race Replay is an absolute show stealer, and there’s nothing better than solving the strategic puzzle laid out for you in a single go. F1 Manager 2023 is as enjoyable to listen to at normal speed as it is to play, and although you can rush at 16x speed for an entire season in an afternoon if you want, it’s far more relaxing to treat it like an actual race and just chill out and watch. F1 Manager 2023 is a deep sports management experience that understands that racing can be a sport everyone can enjoy and, if you enjoy any type of management game at all, you should consider adding this to your collection.

Disney Illusion Island ,7,"With the cost of living going up and the quality of superhero movies going down, it feels like we could probably all use a cuddle right now. Disney Illusion Island seems to sense this, because this co-operative platforming adventure for up to four players features a dedicated hug button to give your partner an instant health boost whenever they’re struggling to go on. It’s an endearing bit of mouse-to-mouse resuscitation, and it’s just one of a handful of examples of kindhearted collaboration that helps to make Disney Illusion Island approachable to players of almost every age and aptitude level. There are certainly more innovative modern Metroidvanias on the market as far as level design and boss encounters are concerned but, on the strength of its warm and fuzzy feel-good factor alone, Disney Illusion Island is worth throwing your arms around. Its whimsical charm is evident from the outset. Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy arrive on the mysterious island of Monoth intending to indulge in a picnic, but are soon tasked with retrieving three magical tomes that have been stolen from the island’s library and spirited away to three interconnected biomes that make up Monoth’s vivid 2D landscape. Disney Illusion Island’s adventure is presented in a classical, hand-drawn art style that recalls the House of Mouse’s earliest forms of animation, but its irreverent and self-aware sense of humour feels noticeably more contemporary in tone. Although most of the interactions with the eccentric cast of island locals you meet along the way is purely text-based outside of a handful of major cutscenes, Disney Illusion Island still managed to elicit regular chuckles from my son and I as we breezed along through its ever-expanding world and busily ticked off its growing list of upbeat story quests.  While its map eventually becomes a sizable rabbit warren – or perhaps <i>mouse hole</i> – of 2D tunnels that spiral out in all directions, Disney Illusion Island is not the kind of Metroidvania that expects you to get stuck for long. Checkpoints are generously staggered, directions to specific areas are clearly marked with in-game signposts, and there are even some handy teleportation devices at several story junctions that allow you to skip return trips entirely in order to beam Mickey and the gang directly to the next mission marker. As a result, while the story took me around six hours to complete, very little of that time was wasted retracing my steps or getting confused about where to head next. It makes for a journey that maintains a strong sense of forward momentum to match the fluid set of movements of its four main characters. iframe allow=""autoplay; fullscreen *"" allowautoplay="""" allowfullscreen=""true"" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/disney-illusion-island/70036/gallery/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery70036"" scrolling=""no""></iframe Each member of Disney Illusion Island’s quirky quartet is indeed a joy to steer around, with a simple and responsive set of inputs and just the right amount of floatiness to allow for split-second corrections in midair. New abilities are unlocked at regular intervals in order to gain access to previously gated areas, from wall jumps to earth-shattering ground pounds and grappling hook swings. While there’s nothing here that hasn’t been seen elsewhere in the platforming genre many times over (you can even pull off a Mario-style side-flip when you reverse direction just before a jump), it’s all implemented so smoothly that performing a series of leaps, swings, and slides in quick succession often had me feeling higher than the pitch of Mickey’s voice. All of the four playable characters feature the same expanded moveset – presumably to cutdown on squabbling at the character selection screen – but I appreciated the uniquely entertaining ways in which they’re presented; Mickey’s glide move sees him whip out a pedal-powered gyro-copter to slowly drift down to earth, while food-obsessed Goofy pulls out a giant bottle of mustard to slow his descent with a spluttering squirt. To be clear, none of these unlockable abilities are combat-based. Although Disney Illusion Island is home to a rogue’s gallery of ill-tempered ‘toons ready to trip you up at every turn, each and every one of them is to be carefully avoided since you’re not even equipped with a basic butt-stomp to fight back with – which is possibly for the best due to the fact that most of the enemies have spiky exteriors and Donald Duck still stubbornly refuses to wear pants. That said, there are still a handful of boss encounters, but they put the emphasis on passive platforming rather than direct assaults. In one you have to hop between a shuffling sequence of buttons to trigger the drop of giant capsule toys onto the head of a robotic thief, while in another you must grapple and swing off a number of perches in order to shake acorns loose that crash down onto a feathered foe. If those two examples sound somewhat similar, it’s because they very much are, and I wish developer Dlala Studios had channeled a little more creativity into these showdowns because Disney Illusion Island’s boss fights feel more like one-dimensional, paint-by-numbers contests rather than full-on Fantasia-style spectacles. Its cooperative play, though, is truly commendable – particularly if you have a balance of experienced players with more novice adventurers on the couch. Aside from hugging it out anytime you need an extra heart added to your health bar – which never stops being both useful and utterly adorable – Disney Illusion Island equips each player with additional methods of assistance to ensure that no mouse, pantsless duck or pants-wearing dog gets left behind. If another player is struggling to reach a platform higher up, you can drop a rope down to give them a shortcut. If they’re too intimidated to swim through a swirling school of enemy fish in one of the underwater passages, you can drop a marker and teleport them directly to safety. Seasoned platforming fans might ignore these sweet-natured support measures entirely, but they’re invaluable in ensuring the weakest link in your co-op chain is rarely forced to suffer or sit out for stretches of time simply because they died too soon.  Of course, Disney Illusion Island can also be played solo if you choose, and it’s certainly the most effective way to experience the adventure if you’re after any form of challenge, particularly towards the story’s end where constant prickly surfaces and waves of projectiles put your platforming reflexes to the test. On your own there’s no way to skip obstacles, and extra hearts need to be sought out and collected in the world rather than coaxed out of a co-op partner with a cuddle. However, checkpoints remain abundant and even during its most taxing passages of level design this is still relatively gentle stuff for the genre, with wide timing windows for wall jumps and grappling hook throws that are practically magnetic. If Super Meat Boy is close to the pinnacle of punitive platforming experiences, then Disney Illusion Island is positively vegan by comparison. While I did play chunks of the adventure on my own, I certainly had a much better time of it with my son riding shotgun. The Glimt you collect – an analogue for Mario’s coins or Sonic’s rings – contributes to the one pool rather than individual purses, so there’s no real reward for whoever can hoover them up first. However we still found ways to indulge in a bit of friendly rivalry. One of the best examples of this are the selfies you can take with Mickey symbols hidden throughout the world. It quickly became a competitive game within a game for one of us to find one before the other, not unlike trying to be the first to spot a certain colour of car on the highway during a family road trip. It did strike me as being a little cumbersome that I was forced to quit out to the main menu and then restart at a checkpoint any time my son wanted to join or leave my game, though. For a 2023 multiplayer platformer, no drop-in drop-out feels like a bit of a co-op cop-out. Glimt, which can be invested in permanently increasing the number of hearts for each player, is not the only collectible to be found in Disney Illusion Island. While progress through its main quest may be heavy on handholding, there’s still some joy of discovery to be found poking through suspect walls that reveal numerous hidden secrets, including mementos from Mickey’s most famous appearances on screens both silver and small. I rolled credits on the story at only 70% total completion, and I’ve since spent a couple of hours trying to seek out all the character cards and memorabilia I missed. While I’ve enjoyed the extra time spent in Disney Illusion Island’s vibrant cartoon kingdom, the more I explore it the more I lament the absence of a mini-map in its HUD. It’s somewhat of a shame to stall your smooth platforming motion from one corner of the map to the other simply because you have to constantly pause and un-pause the game to consult the full map at each fork in the path. I expected a mini-map, but all I got was a Minnie Mouse. Disney Illusion Island’s platforming may be extremely polished but it’s not particularly inventive, and nor is it likely to appeal to anyone who favours a more combat-oriented Metroidvania experience – its enemies are strictly for dodging rather than destroying, and its small assortment of boss fights are mostly anticlimactic. Where it excels, though, is in providing a wholesome co-operative journey through a charismatic cartoon world that’s well-suited to pairings of parents and their children, or perhaps older and younger siblings. It effectively gives every member of the party the means to happily bound along on the ride without ever being made to feel like a burden. If you’re after a frictionless, family-friendly platforming adventure that’s heavy on charm and light on challenge, then Disney Illusion Island fits the bill better than a muzzle on Donald Duck. "
mnant 2 ,9,"When you look back at the history of new games and their sequels, oftentimes it’s not until the second attempt at a bold new idea that things really hit their stride. Following in the footsteps of breakthrough sequels like Borderlands 2 and Assassin’s Creed 2 before it, Remnant 2 iterates on the original to phenomenal effect. Combat is even smoother and more satisfying, loot and buildcrafting have been greatly improved to allow for countless possibilities and reasons to grind, boss fights have been completely overhauled to ditch spongy bosses aided by endless waves of minions, and each of the realms feel diverse and brimming with things to do and secrets to uncover. But procedurally generated, impressively replayable levels remain its killer feature, and here they have been improved in so many ways that it's alarmingly easy to lose half a day by jumping back into the same area just to see other possibilities. We don’t have to wait for the next one: when it comes to games, the second time’s the charm.   Back in 2019 a lot of us, myself included, lovingly referred to the original Remnant: From The Ashes as “Dark Souls with guns,” and the sequel seems to nod in violent agreement with that characterization. You and up to two allies will navigate gloriously hazardous areas packed with devilish enemies who make short work of anyone without the skill or patience to overcome its intentionally challenging levels. All the familiar soulslike ideas are present and accounted for, from limited-use healing items to enemies who respawn whenever you rest at a checkpoint, but like the first game, Remnant 2 doesn’t content itself with throwing a science-fiction skin onto a tried-and-true formula. Instead, it expertly blends the best parts of fellow co-op looter shooters like Borderlands and Outriders, including an extraordinarily deep loot grind and buildcrafting, and adds plenty of interesting twists that are all its own, like procedurally generated levels and a strong set of diverse worlds for you and your teammates to jump between. The result is a unique hodgepodge of great ideas that go together like peanut butter and chocolate, but with a whole lot more shooting monsters in the face and getting murdered by blobs of sentient meat. What’s not to love? Just like its predecessor, the surreal story has you playing as a nameless survivor in a post-apocalyptic Earth where a race of evil trees called The Root are attempting to take over the multiverse. Super weird, right? That setup is mostly used to justify you teleporting to different realities to do really awesome looter-shooter stuff and save the day, but it only ever becomes slightly more interesting than that one-sentence premise. You get to chat with new and returning characters at your base, Ward 13, (most of whom have a lot to say while giving you as little actual information as possible), learn more about The Root and what’s going on with the multiversal war, and eventually come to a dramatic conclusion that’s immediately reversed so that you can continue playing without dealing with the consequences of the finale. It’s not that the writing is bad – in fact, some of it is quite good and there’s definitely some interesting concepts at play here that the community will doubtless be crafting theories about in the weeks and months ahead – it’s just that very little of that has any impact on your blank slate of a character, and it’s all so high-concept it often doesn’t gel with an adventure that’s so squarely focused on shooting alien lobsters in the thorax. The good news is that the different worlds you travel to on your journey contain bite-sized stories of their own, which are expertly told and far more compelling than your main quest. You might find yourself in a high-fantasy world of elves trying to solve a murder mystery, or aboard a starship helping a huge Gundam Wing-looking robot recover his lost cargo. Not only are those stories better, but you also spend the vast majority of your time in those worlds resolving them rather than concerning yourself with the main story. It’s just a shame that anytime I was back on Earth or dealing with the primary conflict my eyes glossed over while I listened to rambling from characters I felt I barely knew at all.  No matter which stretch of the adventure you’re working your way through, though, every second of its challenging gunplay is a total blast. Every new area is a dramatic dance of shooting, dodging, making clever use of abilities, and doing your best to not get surrounded by whatever relentless enemy is trying their best to maim and dismember you. What starts as a relatively simple toolbox containing a primary and secondary weapon, something to swing in melee combat, and a single archetype skill quickly spirals into a treasure trove of weapons, armor, highly customizable character classes, and mods that hasn’t come close to feeling stale after my first few dozen hours. A major part of what makes combat continuously feel so fresh is that you keep hopping between different worlds in the multiverse, each with their own distinct feel and new enemies to battle. One of them, N’Erud, is a sci-fiction reality filled with violent robots, electronic gizmos, and laser guns, while Losomn is a fantasy realm with cockney elves who wear bowler hats and try to cut your throat in between what I can only assume are their busy chimney-sweeping schedules. The worlds are so starkly distinct that sometimes I could hardly believe I was still in the same game I’d been playing just minutes prior. It's quite jarring – in a good way that makes each transition between them memorable – to go from battling stone golems in a multiversal labyrinth to hunting beasties in a lush, primordial forest, and the novelty of that hasn’t gotten old one bit. It certainly helps that every area is jam-packed with optional quests to tackle, secret areas to explore, and an extremely surprising number of legitimately challenging puzzles to noodle on.  Really, the only thing that nags at me about combat is that, despite there being a handful of very different worlds to explore, most of them only have a handful of unique enemy types to fight, so you end up fighting a lot of the same brand of baddies all in a row. It’s not that enemy diversity is weak overall, because taken as a whole there are probably more types in Remnant 2 than in most games, but since they’re divided among so many worlds and you typically spend about five or six hours at a stretch going through each one, I did get a tad bit tired of seeing the same group of flying gargoyles and armored knights in the world of Losomn for so long. However, moving on to the next area quickly washes away any would-be monotony. Each world also includes, as you’d expect, a bunch of boss battles, and this is one of those areas where you can tell that the developers listened to community feedback about the first Remnant’s boss fights lacking any real personality. Often they’d pit you against a forgettable enemy and then throw massive amounts of henchmen at you to artificially inflate the encounter’s difficulty. I’m extremely happy to report that Remnant 2 has not only corrected this weakness, but now counts its boss fights as one of its main strengths. Remnant: From the Ashes delivers a beautifully deranged vision of the apocalypse overflowing with twisted creatures hellbent on making you suffer. The thrill of finally beating a boss that’s had your number for hours is right up there with the Souls games that so clearly inspired it, though the underwhelming gear system sometimes brings down the high of overcoming the frequent difficulty spikes. Overall it’s a solid game that offers one of the best and most rewarding co-op experiences in quite some time, as long as you have a hint of desire to challenge and punish yourself over and over. <i>– David Jagneaux, August 20, 2019</i Score: 8 Read the full <a href=""/remnant-from-the-ashes/28439/review/remnant-from-the-ashes-review"">Remnant: From the Ashes review</a While there are certainly some uninspired fights, like a random lady who throws Molotov cocktails at you and a blob monster who’s just a beefier version of an existing enemy you see a lot already, the vast majority are not only delightfully difficult tests of your skill and your character’s build, but also have plenty of interesting mechanics. There’s one fight where looking at the boss for a few seconds makes your character go mad and die so you have to quickly turn your back while you compose yourself, and another where a ghost traps you in a haunted house and pops out of the walls to scratch your face off. My personal favorite is an unforgettable encounter where you become trapped in a maze and have to physically fight the labyrinth itself as you navigate it and avoid getting crushed by giant cubes. In fact, that encounter might be my new favorite boss fight in any game, period – it’s <i>that </i>good. In order to stay ahead of the increasingly powerful enemies and boss fights that Remnant 2 has in store, you’ll need to spend a lot of time gleefully optimizing your build. The most significant and exciting decision you’ll make – and then constantly iterate upon – is your archetype (aka your class). At the start you’ll pick from four core archetypes including a support-focused Medic, a badass close-quarters tank called the Challenger, a long-range sniper and scout called the Hunter, and the Handler, which gives you an extremely useful dog companion. The Hunter, for example, has an ability that highlights all enemies on the battlefield and a passive perk that makes critical hits extend the duration of any skills they’ve got equipped, while the Challenger can do an area-of-effect war stomp at enemies in front of them and automatically gets back up after taking fatal damage. Leveling up your archetype unlocks new possibilities too, from perks that affect you and any teammates in your group, to bonuses that trigger for a limited time after you use your relic – your consumable healing item that’s the equivalent to Elden Ring’s Flask of Crimson Tears.  Remnant 2 sagely allows you to switch archetypes at will, so you’re free to experiment and level up every role on a single character instead of restarting from scratch. But the real fun comes once you unlock the ability to simultaneously equip a second archetype in the middle of the campaign; this opens up a whole new world of possibilities. Equipping The Handler and The Hunter at the same time, for example, has some great synergy where you can direct your furry ally to distract and obstruct the enemy while you pick them off with a sniper from a distance. Better still, there are an unknown amount of other archetypes you can unlock by completing specific quests hidden throughout the fractured worlds you’ll journey through. In one area, I made an offering to a secret vendor that granted me the fantastic Summoner archetype, turning me into a monster summoning witch. In another, I tracked down an elusive enemy that gave me the consumable-focused Alchemist archetype, which allowed me to use powerful thrown concoctions to control the battlefield. It took me a dozen hours of hunting just to find the handful of archetypes I discovered and there are undoubtedly plenty I still haven’t found, and searching for these awesome game-changers has me practically foaming at the mouth.  Beyond archetypes, there’s an absolute ton of weapons, rings, amulets, and armor to round out your build, and half a dozen ways you can further modify and upgrade your equipment to your exact liking. It’s a veritable buildcrafter’s Shangri-La, and with most of the equipment being hidden throughout the world (including many that are locked behind obscure secret puzzles and quests) and others that drop from powerful enemies, there’s always a reason to get back out there and explore. All of this combines into some of the most spellbinding combat I’ve seen in a looter-shooter in a long time, and I spent way too many hours just experimenting with different permutations of my loadout and hunting for new tools to add to my collection. In fact, I somehow have more than 80 rings so far – and I get the sense I’m not even close to finding them all!  There is one major disappointment in Remnant 2’s buildcrafting, however, and that’s in the quite underwhelming armor. While there are plenty of sets to find or purchase from vendors, there aren’t any ways to improve or customize armor in the same way you can with weapons, mods, and practically every other facet. It’s an especially surprising omission considering Remnant: From The Ashes has an armor upgrading system that allows you to invest in your favorite sets and improve your resistances and armor. I miss that. While it only took me 20 hours to “complete” Remnant 2, that’s only the beginning of the time I’ll actually spend playing it. One of this series’ characteristics – virtually unique within its genre – is its procedurally generated levels, storylines, and sidequests that make each run feel different. It’s both impressively unpredictable and so well organized that you could play through all of Remnant 2 without knowing that anything wasn’t hand-built… right up until you talk to your friend about your respective playthroughs and almost immediately realize that you aren’t playing the same campaign. You’ll almost certainly end up in different worlds in a different order, fight different bosses, and find completely different quests. That’s possible because every world contains two possible storylines and various other permutations along the way. This isn’t just a matter of rooms being haphazardly stitched together to add minimal diversity in lieu of unique content – the differences between each run can be so dramatic they hardly even feel like they’re part of the same world.   In one playthrough of a realm called Yaesha, I spent almost the entire time indoors traipsing through dark corridors full of crazed cultists, while on another I found myself in dense woods with a blood-red moon looming overhead, and in another still I was lost amid a maze of hovering platforms, surrounded by floating aliens who bombarded me with plasma projectiles. In one run of the fantasy world Losomn, I spent my entire run among the slums and sewers of that world’s lower class, fighting off vandals and ne’er-do-wells; in another I spent most of my time in the gilded palaces of the noble elites, fighting winged angels and armored paladins. They’re almost entirely different.  You don’t have to start a new campaign to experience them, though. After you’ve beaten the final boss on your first playthrough of any given world you can immediately and infinitely reroll that area any time you want, generating new possibilities and a fresh set of quests to complete along with it. At a minimum, you’d need to run through each world two times just to see all the major stuff. And even if you manage to get some of the same sidequests multiple times, as I sometimes did, you can make a different decision at the end to see what would have happened (and which rewards you would gain) had you let things go the other way. I don’t know that I’ve ever seen a more effective and creative use of procedural generation before, and the near-perfect execution in that regard makes Remnant 2 ridiculously replayable.  Speaking of different worlds, since this is a cooperative multiplayer game you can hop into one of your friends' worlds to help them out, gain XP, and share in their rewards, and see how different their worlds are from yours. Playing in co-op is an expectedly good time, though it does come with worse performance than in solo play (playing on PC I saw more frequent framerate hitches and occasional disconnects) and some questionable enemy scaling that can make combat less welcoming to groups. It’s a bit of a bummer, for example, that I was breezing through one area in solo play, then got utterly hammered when I invited two of my lower-level friends to join me. Whatever level adjusting happens behind the scenes at least ensures lower-level players won’t immediately get torn apart when joining a higher-level player, but it definitely makes it much harder for the whole group to succeed by bumping up enemy health and damage output by a whole heck of a lot. You’d think with drop-in/drop-out co-op, a game would want to welcome newcomers to join their friends and with the current damage scaling it makes them more likely to just get frustrated and leave. (Also, it’s worth noting that Remnant 2 does not currently support cross-play between PC, PlayStation, and Xbox versions.) It’s astounding to think that if I were to create a list of my favorite soulslikes, my favorite looter shooters, and my favorite procedurally generated games, Remnant 2 would appear on all of those lists. This is a triumphant sequel that doesn’t just reimagine the soulslike genre as a co-op looter-shooter, but absolutely nails that concept in nearly every way – including many that the original did not. With completely engrossing combat, challenging and memorable boss fights, ultra-dense buildcrafting options, incredibly cool procedurally generated levels, and a clever multiversal concept that allows for a ton of different adventures in one package, it’s very likely going to become one of my most-played games this year. No matter which part of the multiverse you find yourself in, you should do yourself a favor and play this gem. "
Pikmin 4 ,9,"Ever since the original Pikmin sprouted up out of nowhere on the GameCube, this oddball puzzle-strategy series has always held a special place in my heart – but when I played Pikmin 4, my heart grew two sizes that day. While the earliest hours started out slower than I would have liked, it reminded me of an onion – in the best kind of way – in that every layer I peeled back added more and more depth, eventually growing into the best version of the idea at the heart of it. Not all of it is as challenging as I’d have liked, but with twice as many enemy types and nearly four times the amount of hidden treasures I loved gathering in past games – along with its fantastic musical score, improved graphics, and next-level post-game content – I just couldn’t put it down until finishing everything it had to offer. Right from the very start, there’s a series first: While previous games have starred fan-favorite heroes such as Olimar and Louie, Pikmin 4 allows you to customize your character’s hair, body type, and suit color. Though it’s not the most spectacular character creator next to something like <a href=""/street-fighter-6/67599/review/street-fighter-6-review"">Street Fighter 6</a>, it’s a nice touch as your color choices apply to your ship and everybody in your space crew as well.  However, I spent far more time taking in the beautiful worlds of Pikmin 4 than checking out my own character. Pikmin 4 continues the series’ tradition of playing as an alien the size of an ant exploring an Earth-like planet that is probably actually Earth. Charmingly most of the treasures you end up collecting are named after their appearance, so “Space Spinners” and “the Stone of Advancement” are really just fidget spinners and a Game Boy Advance SP. i>Thanks to all of the Pikmin games being made available on the Switch, it made it very easy to see just how far the series has come. Pikmin may not be as popular as Nintendo’s other biggest names, but what it often lacks in mainstream popularity is the intensity that some fans have for the series including renting out </i><a href=""/pikmin-4/69466/news/pikmin-4-fans-take-over-times-square-with-twerking-olimar"">ad space on a billboard in Times Square to promote it</a><i>. </i Everything from the soil on the ground to the foliage everywhere on the maps is vibrant, and each location feels distinct. A simple garden filled with (literally) larger-than-life insects and flowers that tower over you is filled with obstacles like a broken potted plant that blocks a passage and a puddle in the dirt that becomes a small lake. A sandy beach reveals new paths to navigate and enemies to battle after the tide recedes, and a house with multiple sets of stairs becomes mountainlike until you find a way to create ramps so your tiny followers can recover the treasures hidden inside. Much of the fun and strategy of Pikmin games comes from collecting and commanding different types of obedient little plant creatures to do your bidding, and <i>generally</i> avoiding sending them to their doom. It’s not a full-on real-time strategy game like StarCraft, since there’s no base-building and outside of the newly added night missions you don’t have to worry about an enemy army attacking you back, but there’s always a lot happening on screen when you have dozens of these multicolored minions doing things like digging tunnels and carrying treasures and you’re literally hurling them into combat.  For those jumping into Pikmin for the first time, it can seem like a lot, especially with nine types of cutesy creatures to master, having to split your attention between multiple objectives, and learning to manage your resources. To its great credit, Pikmin 4 does a gentle job of rolling out new Pikmin, items, and abilities at a pace that won’t overwhelm with too many options too soon. Your first steps onto this world come with a large number of tutorials and explanations – though someone like myself, who has been playing Pikmin games for 22 years, may not be able to skip the dialogue fast enough because it rarely covers anything we don’t already know. One of the most immediately noticeable differences between Pikmin 4 and its predecessors is that here there’s no limit to the number of days you have to finish the story like in the original, nor is there any threat of running out of supplies like in Pikmin 3, making it more of a casual rescue mission than a race against the clock. This decision is especially great for newcomers because it removes the pressure or worry of doing something wrong and being punished for the rest of your playthrough, but I enjoyed it too because it allowed me to tackle objectives in any order I liked and fulfill my inner need to see that 100% completion on each stage. It’s comparable to how Dead Rising removed its time limit in the fourth game in recognition of the fact that, more often than not, people play games to escape from the tension of impending deadlines that haunt us in school or work. Even without a lot of time pressure, mistakes will still happen: maybe you’ll misjudge an enemy attack range and become frozen, allowing a nearby enemy to crush or devour your Pikmin before you can react, or maybe you’ll just accidentally chuck a few Pikmin off the map while you were trying to toss them at a piece of treasure hanging from a spiderweb to weight it down and break the web so you can bring it back to your ship. In previous games careless errors like these would’ve meant spending precious time replenishing Pikmin before you can progress, but in Pikmin 4 we get a handy feature that can bail you out: Until you finish the current day, you can choose to rewind and replay parts of a level to improve your efficiency. It’s effectively a method of quickly reloading a checkpoint save, and as a perfectionist at heart, I found myself taking advantage of this system constantly in order to maximize my efficiency or save my valuable purple and white Pikmin that are scarce early on. It makes much more sense to retry a section rather than spending a chunk of my time the next day replacing Pikmin I lost. The ability to rewind extends right up to the end of your expedition, which is a huge relief – if you have played Pikmin before, you are aware of how stressful it can be when that 10-second warning appears, signaling the end of the day, while you still have 60+ Pikmin carrying multiple objects from different locations. In Pikmin 4, if you are unable to gather them all before nightfall it will tell you how many you stand to lose if you choose to continue, but ask if you would like to rewind time to one of the checkpoints to try again instead. This was a huge time-saver and kept me from having to replay entire levels when I’d only messed up the home stretch. Pikmin 3 Deluxe makes an already excellent game even better and transplants it onto a console where far more people have a chance to see how good it really is. Its Side Stories and difficulty modes aren’t massive additions, but they gave me more of the already clever and fast-paced fun that made me fall in love with the original game seven years ago. And while not as flashy new missions, there are a downright impressive amount of smaller touches and quality-of-life adjustments throughout (including replacing the Wii U’s Gamepad screen with Switch-friendly controls) that make this the best the Pikmin series has ever felt. There’s plenty of reason to come back for returning players, and if you missed Pikmin 3 on the Wii U then you absolutely shouldn’t repeat that mistake here. – <i>Tom Marks, October 28, 2020</i Score: 9 Read the full <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/pikmin-3-deluxe-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Pikmin 3 Deluxe review</a Among the many things to keep track of in Pikmin 4 is a wonderful new companion: the two-legged lil’ pup Oatchi. He can carry you and your entire army of Pikmin on his back across obstacles like water, sniff out hidden items, and grant you the ability to jump to help you reach shortcuts and items like never before. His upgradable abilities gave me another reason to seek out crew members lost on the planet, because the reward for finding them is ability points that let you increase everything from his ability to carry heavy objects to improving his dig speeds. Those upgrades all felt impactful, though some, like having him fetch Pikmin for me, became obsolete once I unlocked the ability to summon them myself with the press of a button. Out of all of them, Oatchi’s charge attack became my favorite of his abilities. Higher levels give him the ability to stun enemies for longer periods, while at the same time sending my entire horde of Pikmin onto a target to dispatch them quickly. This proved to be one of the best strategies for combat, and with the exception of bosses, it usually took down most enemies in one move – if I had enough or the right types of Pikmin along for the ride. strong></strong That’s the real trick to Pikmin 4’s combat because the 110 unique enemies (including new elemental variants of returning creatures like Bulborbs and Dweevils) increase the need to adjust the composition of your army to counter them. For instance, if you try to battle a Fiery Bulblax with anything other than red Pikmin they’ll ignite and run off screaming to their doom, meanwhile the Horned Cannon Beetle kept its backside weak point hidden unless I tossed one of the larger Purple, Ice, or Rock Pikmin into its blowhole above its head. Discovering my Otachi strategy early was great because it allowed me to spend less time replacing Pikmin lost in combat and more time collecting the 239 treasures across the six locations and 22 cave sub-levels I explored. Though once I fully leveled Oatchi’s Rush ability, it never got old being able to charge through a line of enemies and see the souls of my enemies ascend into the sky. Some of those sub-levels place you inside machine structures with conveyor belts, a kid's room filled with structures made from wooden blocks, and a freezer filled with cold-emitting dry ice that will freeze most Pikmin in their tracks. Navigating these kinds of hazards never failed to put a smile on my face – though it’s a different kind of smile than the one that creeps in when I hear the cries of my loyal Pikmin that I sometimes tossed to their certain doom in order to reach my objective. There are also some very cool Easter eggs that I won’t spoil for you, other than to say you will definitely want to give a close look at the musical items. Most boss battles are saved for the lower floors of the various cave sub-levels, and while there are plenty of returning faces here we also encounter a fun handful of new ones, like the Sovereign Bulblax and the Foolix, the latter of which is a clever evolution on the Goolix from the very first Pikmin. At first he caught me off guard (making me look like a fool, appropriately) thanks to its clever disguise as a drop of nectar. Considering all the new types of enemies with elemental properties and the fact that Pikmin 4 only lets you bring out three types of Pikmin at a time, I felt encouraged to plan out my strategy for the day accordingly. Rock Pikmin are a staple of mine, as their hardy core both deals high damage when flung at bosses and prevents them from being crushed under the weight of larger enemies like the Yellow Wollywog, but I’d often switch between ice, winged, and white Pikmin when I knew I’d need to counter threats like the airborne Lesser Spotted Jellyfloat or the toxic-based Moldy Slooch. Between those and Oatchi’s list of skills, the scales usually felt tipped in my favor. You can control Oatchi directly, but I found him more helpful as Pikmin 4’s method of splitting up your party so you can tackle more objectives simultaneously. From the map screen you can give him commands to find treasures, lost team members, and specific Pikmin types while you take care of tasks on the other side of the map. This gave me more options in general: while exploring the Serene Shores level, I would send Oatchi and Blue Pikmin to locations only accessible to them. At the same time, I took an army of Yellow and Red Pikmin across the beach, defeating enemies and digging up buried treasure.  Getting the hang of this multitasking is a necessity to earn the best rewards in some of the later challenges.   This leads me to a minor gripe about how co-op works in Pikmin 4. Unlike Pikmin 2 or 3, where a second player could take control of another character and the two of you could split up to help reduce the time it took to find everything on a stage, Pikmin 4 instead has your co-op partner play as a reticle floating around the screen that can throw pebbles to move objects or hit enemies as your character does his usual thing. I would consider it more of an assist mode, like what we saw in Super Mario Galaxy, rather than an actual co-op mode. That’s a bit of a letdown for anyone wanting to play through with a friend or significant other like we did in the previous games, but I imagine it will be great for allowing kids to help out a parent or older sibling – or vice versa. As for the two new Pikmin types, the first you’ll encounter are ice Pikmin, and with them comes the ability to freeze bodies of water and enemies. They quickly became one of my favorites thanks to their freezing effect, which works in tandem with Oatchi’s stun and allows you to chain status effects on enemies big and small – instead of spending time defeating enemies, you can just freeze them for long enough to get in and out. They are also key to destroying various ice barriers, and for navigating some of the caves with freezing temperatures that slow other Pikmin down, making them a solid option in most situations. Glow Pikmin are the other new additions, but they are only really available in the regularly occurring night missions. There, you’ll trade in your real-time strategy-style gameplay for a simplistic tower defense format where you’re challenged to protect various anthill-like structures until morning (or until all enemies have been defeated) using only Glow Pikmin. The lower difficulty stages started out basic and short but soon evolved into levels with multiple points to defend from hordes of enemies, often requiring me to leave Oatchi on defense while I explored on foot to figure out the optimal routes for protecting multiple points from waves of enemies. I didn’t really care for these early on, but around the midway point of the campaign they added some new terrifying creatures and secondary points to defend, finally introducing the complexity and enemy variety I craved. As someone who seeks out challenge, I wasn’t a huge fan of one of the other additions: a set of overpowered single-use items. Alongside the standard ultra-spicy spray that temporarily boosts Pikmin performance and the bomb rocks that destroy concrete walls we get single-use items like Lightning Shock that can paralyze everything on the screen with electricity. Being able to toss bombs with homing or proximity effects kills all the tension in battles that otherwise have me frantically dashing around and flinging Pikmin to defeat enemies while keeping my little guys from being eaten or crushed. After testing them all out I felt like I had to artificially limit my use of them in most situations because they removed any need to be strategic. This, again, is great for younger players who are still learning the ropes of Pikmin, and they will surely appreciate the assistance, but since Pikmin 4 doesn’t offer any difficulty settings (like some of the previous games in the series have) they feel like too easy of a solution. The one limitation on the power of these special items is that the raw materials you use to purchase them is also tied to building bridges to give you shortcuts through levels and permanent upgrades for yourself and Oatchi. Even without using many items, sometimes I would find myself without enough raw materials to build a bridge because I spent too many on upgrades, requiring me to circle back and gather more from deeper in the level to build them.  Upgrades were my favorite use of raw materials because they include everything from boots that increase your movement speed to suits that grant elemental immunities and armor to increase your HP and Defense. While most upgrades aren’t required to finish the story there are some locations, like an entrance to one of Pikmin 4’s many sub-levels hidden in the center of a stove’s burner, which require you to have an elemental immunity for both yourself and Oatchi just to get inside. Purchasing these sorts of upgrades early on made obstacles less of an issue as I scoured the levels for more raw materials and other items, and kept me excited for the next upgrade to become available.  The story took me around 20 hours to complete, but in classic Pikmin tradition, that is less the real ending than a signal of more to come. While I can’t go into detail, I will say that the post-credits content in Pikmin 4 might just be the best the Pikmin series has ever delivered. In fact, Pikmin 4’s greatest folly is that it saves the best of its new tricks until you have completed the campaign’s first ending and seen the credits, because I would’ve liked to have dived right into all of these creative locations, met their bizarre inhabitants, and unlocked its homage to previous Pikmin games.  Beyond the story and what comes after, Pikmin 4 offers a pair of modes designed to test your aptitude at the concept of Dandori: a Japanese word for the practice of organizing tasks strategically and working effectively to execute plans. In the Dandori Challenges you must gather all the treasures in a set location with a limited number of Pikmin, and the final couple of courses buck Pikmin’s trend of being kid-friendly and are sure to test the best Pikmin players out there if they want to earn the coveted Platinum medal. Some of these took me more than a handful of attempts!  And then there’s the Dandori Battle mode, a chaotic mix of combat and gathering, and it’s an enjoyable way to challenge my multitasking skill against an opponent who wants to win just as much as I do. You can play against the AI or a friend in local multiplayer, which is nice, but it’s a shame there's no online capability. Like the three wonderfully weird mainline games before it, Pikmin 4 has once again captured my heart with its charming creatures that fearlessly follow commands regardless of their own well-being. The difficulty leans a bit too much toward the easy side, but all-new features like ability upgrades, a pair of new Pikmin, and our loyal sidekick Oatchi add some variety to the traditional gameplay by offering options other than the grab-and-throw Pikmin formula of the past. Coupled with the largest number of enemies to battle, treasures to collect, and awesome post-game content that incorporates some great callbacks to the earlier games, I’m left with not just a positive outlook on Pikmin 4, but the direction the series is heading as a whole. "
Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals ,7,"As with a lot of sequels, Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals sticks with what works. The first Oxenfree became an instant favorite because it’s a horror game about being on the edge, both literally and metaphorically. It centers on teens on the cusp of adulthood battling terrifying ghosts trapped on the boundary of reality between space and time. Those were two edges that worked extremely well together, especially with time-travel elements that make possible futures and outcomes feel more real. In some ways, Lost Signals feels familiar to the point of being somewhat repetitive, but it still goes just a bit further. You have a similar array of secrets to uncover, dialogue to engage in, and choices to make that can drastically impact the ending and the relationships you might build. The watercolor-inspired art style does a lot to make it feel like a dream, and the audio design continues to be hard-hitting. It doesn’t outdo the impact of the original, nor is it as scary, but it still finds its own way thanks to some subtle but impactful changes that come together for an emotional and surprising ride rather than a lackluster rehash.   It’s eye-opening how characters’ experiences can change so drastically just by aging them up to adults. Instead of basing a second story around teenagers, the developers at Night School created Riley and Jacob, two 30-somethings who have to figure out how to move forward into the next stage of life while battling those same stranded ghosts (and also some rebellious teens). Between that reoccurring idea, a lot of the gameplay carrying over, and the fact that Lost Signals takes place in a town that neighbors the original setting, it doesn’t take any large swings. But that doesn't stop the core story from being any more impactful. Riley and Jacob are working overnight for an environmental research group that wants to place transmitters across Camena, the coastal town where they grew up that, coincidentally, is near Edwards Island, the old military and tourist location where the first game takes place. People who played the first game already know that there’s nothing good over there, and thankfully, Lost Signals doesn’t devote too much time to re-explaining it. There are recaps, but they’re spread out over the course of the first act to get you caught up or remind you if you’ve forgotten the details since Oxenfree came out in 2016, and it’s just enough to get the characters up to speed, too. The duo quickly comes up against the antagonists — if they can be called that:  a group of teens from a mysterious religious group who are trying to reopen the portals from the first game and unleash whatever’s beyond them. Their leader is a boisterous girl named Olivia, who has readily apparent motives, and it’s frustrating at first because Riley and Jacob take way too long to realize what’s happening, but thankfully, the developers have a few tricks. What is <i>really</i> going on with Olivia and her friends is the big reveal, not <i>why</i> they’re doing it in the first place. I’m still not sure how I feel about this revelation, which simultaneously works with and against the events of the first game, but it’s enough to really change things up before the final act. Riley and Jacob are, understandably, out of their depth, and not just in regard to the ghosts. They are your typical aimless millennials with generational baggage. Riley, who is our point-of-view character, is clearly holding back a lot of intense emotions when we meet her for the first time sleeping at a quiet bus stop. She pairs neatly with Jacob, a meek but generally optimistic guy who can best be described as an airhead. A lot of the story hinges on the conversations these two have as they hike around Camena’s winding trails, and just like in the first game, you can satisfyingly control the vibes and direction of those talks. You can choose to be emotionally distant or open with Jacob; engage with his weird tangents or cut him off. They’re different takes on Riley as a character, but they all still manage to feel like things Riley would do or say, and that’s even before you learn about why she is the way she is. The same range of conversation options goes for the teens as well, who you can befriend and get on your side if you play your cards right. And their interactions are largely interesting because Riley is someone who hasn’t done the best job taking care of herself, so there’s little chance she can change the lives of some aimless kids with a few pep talks. All of this creates a dynamic that sometimes feels like it’s adults vs. teens, which can become grating during times when it’s not handled fairly or realistically. For example, while Olivia’s motivations are understandable, she came off as one-dimensional during my playthrough because she seemed to have absolutely no redeeming characteristics that would explain why people choose to follow her or support her. But I’m left wondering about her because I didn’t do a lot to make her feel heard, so maybe that could be altered in a different playthrough. However, it was obvious who I was going to relate to the most from the start. I’m around the same age as Riley and Jacob, and watching them (sometimes literally) face their baggage and potential futures hit a little too close to home. Like them – and a whole lot of other people in this part of their lives – I’m also sitting on a bit of a precipice between a present that’s not emotionally fulfilling and a potential future that I could work toward. And as somebody who also had some rough teen years, I definitely projected quite a bit on these characters. Riley is an especially relatable figure. She’s clearly closed off and always on the edge of a nervous breakdown, but it isn’t her entire personality. If you allow her, she can reveal a lot of dimension, especially as Lost Signals opens up to reveal what she’ll be experiencing in the years ahead. Just like in the first game, introducing time travel into a personal story is a great way to have characters literally face their future and have them reckon with it, and it still works well here as a way to understand what everybody is dealing with. Naturally that’s all based on personal experience; your mileage will vary with how much you relate to the characters, but their conversations feel real enough that I think most people who would consider picking up a game like Oxenfree in the first place will find something relatable. I particularly enjoyed one section where Jacob leads Riley through one-word story time (where you create a story one word at a time) as a way to distract himself from a particularly traumatic portal event. You can brush him off, but this is just one of the many moments of downtime that allow the characters to really show off who they are. The voice acting is exceptional across the board, but Elizabeth Saydah and Joe Bianco (Riley and Jacob, respectively), also imbue their characters with a lot of personality, which certainly helps with making them seem like actual people. They’re subdued, with the proper amount of “ums” and pauses to make their conversations feel real. Just like in the last one, the crux of Lost Signals is these conversations, where you can respond in one of three ways. I don’t know how many different combinations there are in Lost Signals or how many endings they amount to (there are three major ones I can spot, but it’s possible there are dozens of variations). But there are so many ways to take interactions, which you use to build relationships, which in turn have a big impact on much larger events. If you don’t forge bonds with Olivia’s followers, for example, it can lead to negative consequences when confronting her. Although depending on what kind of Riley you want to play, you might want to keep them at a distance – choices aren’t “good” or “bad,” in the traditional video game sense, so you aren’t compelled to do either except if you want to do multiple playthroughs. One where I sought out secrets and did sidequests took around eight hours, but subsequent runs will likely be shorter. And depending on your ending, you might want to immediately jump into another. After my extremely bittersweet ending, I definitely will be. Oxenfree is elegantly simple, using branching dialogue and a little something supernatural to develop three-dimensional characters and drive the coming-of-age story. There’s not much else to it in terms of gameplay, which is absolutely a good thing, but pacing issues in its story can make it feel sluggish between conversations. Mostly, though, it’s like walking through a stunning painting, listening to the idle chatter and revealing talks of (sometimes unnatural-sounding) teenagers. <i>– Kallie Plagge, January 15, 2016</i Read the full <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/15/oxenfree-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Oxenfree review</a Beyond a whole new set of characters, the developers made other changes to Oxenfree’s template, including a larger setting. This brings more places to explore, but it also creates more empty space that you have to fill. There are quite a few places where you’ll be walking through them and nothing will happen, or you have to backtrack over trails you’ve been across a few times already with nothing new to refresh them. But thankfully, there’s enough that happens throughout the runtime that these moments don’t bog you down too much. The developers do manage to fill Lost Signals out with some new and clever ideas, the biggest being the walkie-talkie. In the first game there was only the radio, but here, there are nine channels where you can talk with other characters. Most of them are optional, but if you choose, you can reach out to a park ranger on channel 1, a fisherman on channel 5, and a high schooler running an advice radio show on channel 8 (make sure to check in on her when you get the chance). It also provides another outlet for some strange transmissions that deepen the weirdness, which is always welcome. These are all characters that feel properly fleshed out, which is impressive considering you never see any of them.  Around Camena you can also find letters from Maggie Adler, a tertiary character from the last game, and complete tasks for some of your walkie-talkie friends. Most of them don’t have a huge impact on the story, but they give you more chances to engage in decision-making, and they explain what’s happening in the wider world as the portals start to wreak more havoc. The same goes for the main story quest as well. You have to visit a few different peaks to plant the transmitters, and you can technically do them in any order. This means you’ll hit certain encounters out of what must’ve been the expected order, which in my playthrough meant a location was ransacked before I got there. It gives way more weight to your choices when even the smallest ones have immediate effects. Hiking around the island also isn’t too easy, which also helps to break up the monotony when quests send you back and forth. Camena is more mountainous than Edwards Island, so there’s a new mountain climbing mechanic. This cuts off specific areas until you get certain equipment (in classic adventure game style), which makes completing the task of placing transmitters at the highest peaks more difficult. It doesn't do a ton to change it up, but it's enough to make Camena feel distinct from Edwards Island, and it does more to fill in the emptiness of the map. It also gives Lost Signals reason to open up new areas like caves and beaches that are off the beaten path and contain secrets and important storylines.  If an area is particularly inaccessible, there’s a chance you might get to take advantage of some portals through time. These dump you out in the past and allow you to cross a bridge that might not be there anymore or use a lift that’s since collapsed. However, this isn’t used nearly enough considering how much much time the developers dedicate to teaching you how they work. These barely tapped puzzle ideas are a missed opportunity to add more to Lost Signals and separate it from its predecessor just a bit more. While the similarities with its predecessor can make Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals feel too familiar, highlighting a few missed opportunities for expansion of its puzzle mechanics and for fresh worldbuilding, it still creates an intimate but epic adventure. The world is built out just enough to feel fresh and to lead you to some unexpected and surprising places. However, its real strengths are its characters. Riley’s story is a standout, but she and Jacob come together to form a bond that carries you through to the (possibly) bitter end. The choice is yours. "
Everybody 1-2-Switch ,4,"Everybody 1-2-Switch might be the first party game I’ve played where I ended up with fewer friends afterwards – and not for any of the good reasons either, like a contentious Mario Kart match that tears friends apart. After roping numerous groups into playing with me, a few of those people aren’t returning my calls. Instead, these former companions live in fear that I’ll ask them to play again, because this game is full of bad ideas that unfortunately soured a good chunk of my holiday weekend. Sadly, Everybody 1-2-Switch is an incredibly disappointing sequel to 1-2-Switch. While its predecessor served as a tech demo – and mission statement of sorts – for a console that was breaking new ground with its controllers, this meager follow-up manages to feel like a major step backwards by hosting a slim collection of uncreative and poorly designed minigames that make shoddy use of what’s still unique about the Switch’s tech.   The idea is that two teams battle it out in a series of non sequitur minigames that have you perform competitive chores, like jumping rope or pumping up balloons, until a winner is declared. The most interesting change from the original is that now there’s a mode where you and your friends can use Apple or Android phones instead of Joy-Cons, so you don’t need to buy a ton of extra controllers to play in a group. The addition of phones does result in a few unique minigames that the Switch wouldn’t be able to do on its own, although they aren’t very entertaining more often than not. There’s one where you literally just play Bingo is a great example of how uncreative they are; this is exactly what we, the under-70 crowd, were all hoping to do on our phones at a party, right? There are a few that are mildly better though, like one where you’re shown a color on-screen then have to search your surroundings for something of a similar color and take a photo of it with your phone’s camera, with the closest match claiming victory. That at least has some novelty to it. Of course, anytime you add cell phones to the mix you can expect some odd technical roadblocks to occasionally gunk up your flow. For example, sometimes we’d get a minigame that required camera or microphone access only to find out that some of the more security conscious in our group had blocked camera access on their browser. That would give us a message saying that the minigame had been canceled because not enough of us could use a camera. Why we weren't able to just give those people an opportunity to enable cameras on their browsers before calling the whole thing off I couldn’t tell you – just don’t be surprised if you have to Google around for tech support. There’s also a more traditional Joy-Con mode that’s filled with by-the-numbers motion-controlled games, like one where you and your friends have to scoot your butts in each other’s general direction in order to bump one another out of a virtual arena. These are about as uninspired as they come, since they ask you to basically just repeat the same motions – in this case involving butts – in each one, whether it’s jumping up and down or swinging your arms to and fro. They’re also very easily exploited by unscrupulous party-goers who’d rather flick their wrist around instead of actually performing the activity – and, in many cases, those party poopers will win handily using their shady tactics. You’ll find only 17 minigames in total (compared to the last game’s 28) and yet even with that low volume many of them are not winners. There’s a samurai dueling game that’s just a carbon copy of the Quick Draw cowboy dueling from the last game, a trivial trivia game that has you answer really difficult questions like, “Is the nose used to see things?” or “What letter comes after C in the alphabet?” and another where you repeat the same motion over and over again to summon little gray aliens so that they can perform the same motion back at you and then leave. There’s certainly some novelty in the bizarre competitions you’re asked to participate in, but what precious few are fun the first time you play them definitely aren’t at all the second and third time. That just makes an already underwhelming curiosity progressively worse the longer you play it.  I’m normally a big fan of the “do this random thing” style of party games, like when Warioware asks me to tickle an old man or pick my nose or whatever, but Everybody 1-2-Switch is just a bundle of some of the least creative minigames I could imagine. Worse yet, they also happen to be terrible showcases of the Switch’s novel technology. There’s a relay race minigame that has you shaking the Joy-Con before passing it on to another player, and another where you have to listen to children order ice cream before you’re quizzed on how many scoops of each flavor were ordered. It’s crazy to me that, in a limitless creative landscape where you could dream up anything you want, you’d choose to make me perform a crummy retail job as a party game. How is that the best Nintendo could come up with in the past six years? 1-2-Switch is the Switch’s version of Wii Sports, in that it acts as an overall mission statement for the console itself. The quirky, bizarre nature of the unique mini-games make it a funny, memorable experience, but some games are hard to play at first due to unclear tutorials and dialogue cues. Despite its oddities and flaws, I have had so, so much fun playing and watching 1-2-Switch with a small group of friends that I can recommend it in that specific situation, but I don’t have much desire to go back. <i>– Alanah Pearce, March 2, 2017</i Read the full <a href=""/1-2-switch/1212/review/1-2-switch-review"">1-2-Switch review</a  After just a couple rounds, you’ll more than likely already find yourself begrudgingly forced to replay the same minigames a second or third time, since your fate is decided by a roulette wheel of options that frequently has the same minigames you just played. With irritatingly few changes to be found through repeated play, the handful of game modes becomes annoying very quickly. Usually there will be only very slight adjustments, like the squatting exercise that adds more fakeouts where the instructors say “squash” or something, but in many cases they’re somehow made even worse in their more advanced forms. For example, the auction minigame asks you to place bids much faster in its later iterations, which takes away a lot of the communication that’s encouraged in the original version and strips out most of the anticipation. Then there are others that change basically nothing at all, like the UFOs minigame that simply has you say goodbye to the aliens you greeted earlier. (More like good riddance.) Thankfully there are a few games where Everybody 1-2-Switch shines, like Joy-Con Hide and Seek, in which one player hides their controller and the other team searches for it, armed with the ability to make the hidden controller vibrate violently to aid their search. There’s also an entertaining game of musical chairs where your reaction speed is tested against your friends in a way that’s less likely to result in injury compared to the original version. It was nice to see neat pockets of creativity in an otherwise-dull collection of uninspired ideas, even if they didn’t do much to improve the group’s enthusiasm for the festivities overall.  Those bright spots certainly don’t balance the scales when so many are just poorly designed, like the ninja game where one team is meant to surround an opposing player and throw ninja stars at them while they defend with a sword. The problem is that the direction stars come from has absolutely no impact – so long as the defender swings at the right time, they’ll block whatever’s thrown their way. And because there’s a clear sound effect every time an attacker throws a ninja star, the defender can literally play with their eyes closed and it’s not even difficult. In my group, the response to this complete lack of challenge was something we started calling “going banshee mode,” where the attackers would scream at the top of their lungs throughout the entire round to make it impossible for the defender to hear the sound effects. Just as there’s no rule that a golden retriever can’t play basketball, there was nothing in the tutorial that prohibited audio interference. As hilarious as that meta was, it felt pretty awful that we were able to master and then undermine minigames so quickly. That’s not the kind of replayability games usually shoot for.  Beyond that, there’s a bunch of the usual issues with motion tracking devices not functioning well enough for competition to feel on the level. One of our Joy-Cons had connectivity issues that made a team fail a rhythm minigame, while input lag during the ice cream parlor game regularly caused losses due to people not being able to get their answer in fast enough. Anyone who’s played party games of this kind will know these certainly aren’t unique problems, but it definitely feels worse when the party favor in question was never fun to begin with. Everybody 1-2-Switch is a tedious and surprisingly small catalog of unoriginal and mostly poorly designed minigames that’s guaranteed to bring any party grinding to a halt. Even with a few interesting ideas, like Joy-Con hide and seek or the color scavenger-hunting modes, there are simply too few options to keep a group’s attention for one game, much less for multiple matches. Throw in the fact that many ideas are mind-numbingly boring, and others are rehashes of stuff found in the original, and you’ve got yourself a great way to rid yourself of unwanted friendships but not much more than that. "
Crash Team Rumble ,7,"On paper, Crash Team Rumble doesn’t seem like it should work. It’s a team-based, competitive platformer that breaks a lot of the rules we associate with other multiplayer games like it. For instance, instead of getting ahead by KOing members of the enemy team, you’re racing to collect 2,000 Wumpa Fruit before they do. But while this concoction may seem strange at a glance, it comes together in surprisingly fun fashion thanks largely to its excellent map design. After spending a week with it after launch, I can confidently say Toys for Bob’s multiplayer take on Crash Bandicoot is one unique and tasty fruit – but it only comes in the one flavor and its character balance could use some work. Rumble’s 4-on-4 matches pit teams of iconic Crash Bandicoot characters against each other. There are currently eight to choose from, each broken into one of three archetypes: Scorers: Crash, Tawna, and Catbat; Blockers: Dingodile, Dr. N. Brio, and Dr. N. Tropy; and Boosters: Coco and Dr. Neo Cortex. It’s a good starting roster – so far I’ve enjoyed playing as every character, and they all feel very different even if they come from the same archetype.  Scorers are, naturally, the best at scoring. They can hold more Wumpa Fruit at one time than the other archetypes, tend to be pretty good at fighting off enemies trying to stop them, and usually have special movement abilities that make them tough to corner. Blockers are good at blocking scorers from scoring. They can sit on the other team’s bank for a long time if played well, with strong offensive capabilities and knack for controlling the space around them. Boosters are a little less straightforward; their job is to support their team, but they do so in a couple of interesting ways. The first is by capturing groups of Gems scattered around the map by jumping on them. Wumpa Fruit may be the name of the game, but capturing Gems is essential because they provide a significant scoring boost. There’s a big difference between turning in Wumpa Fruit normally and turning them in when you control every group of Gems on the map because that means you’re doubling your score. Even capturing at an additional 30% makes a huge difference, and Boosters are custom-built for capturing fights, which can be won and lost in an instant. They excel at keeping other players away from them (or their location), but they’re not just there to capture Gems. The real game-changer is when you take your Booster – who can collect Relics more quickly than Scorers or Blockers – to the stage-specific Epic Relic Stations and cash them in for power-ups. There’s only one of these on each of the nine launch maps, and they’re more expensive than standard Relic Station upgrades that only affect your character, but the rewards are enormous. Just Beachy’s is a Bonus Bank that doubles your Wumpa turn-ins as long as it’s up. City Scrape’s summons TNT drones that chase your enemies. Serenity Gardens’ gets you a Big Bonsai, a tree full of Wumpa Fruit. Others summon dragons, spaceships, sandstorms… there’s a lot. Best of all, each one is specifically tailored to its map’s themes and design, which has helped each and every map feel unique. Matches have an interesting ebb and flow to them. They start out as races to capture as many Gems as possible and build early leads, then turn into ongoing battles over Wumpa, Relic Stations, and Gems when they pop back up again. What each team does often depends on how well the first minute or so plays out: If your team secured most of the map’s Gems, you’ll probably want to cash in your Wumpa advantage; If you didn’t, you’re probably going to need to focus on blocking the other team from scoring or building up a huge Relic cache. Even then, you have interesting choices to make: do you go all-in on the Epic Relic Station or focus on getting a lot of little ones? If the other team looks like they might snag the Epic Relic Station before you, do you try to catch up or just focus on scoring and playing defense? And how dedicated are you to fighting over the Gems when they come back up? There’s no right or wrong answer here; I’ve seen teams get steamrolled because they couldn’t capture any Gems and make huge comebacks because they focused on scoring while the other team put too much emphasis on getting Relics. It all comes down to your ability to adapt to the way the match is going at any given time, and how well you pull off your gameplan. Each match (which usually lasts about five minutes) is fun because you never know how a game will go, and you’re never truly out of it until you lose. Crash Team Rumble asks you to make a lot of important decisions on the fly during the action, but picking your team composition beforehand matters more than most because you can’t change your mind once the match starts. My go-to is Dingodile; his vacuum sucks up Wumpas and enemies from afar; his spin attack hits hard, can be charged, and holds an area well; and he’s pretty tanky, which is just my style. That said, a team of four Dongodiles probably isn’t a good idea because his mobility is limited and he can’t keep up with the Scorers in sheer Wumpa collection, so if someone else beats me to him I’d be inclined to switch to someone else. Locking in a character doesn’t mean you’re stuck doing one thing, though. Sure, Dingodile is a Blocker, but his vacuum lets him suck up Wumpa Fruit quickly and he can hold more of them than the average Blocker or Booster, so he can still score in a pinch. Crash’s speed and ability to carry a lot of Wumpa is core to being a Scorer, but he’s also handy in a fight and his Slam and Super Slam attacks work great if you’re trying to control space or KO another player – ideal for double-duty as a Booster or a Blocker. Each character is different: Tawna has a grappling hook for zooming around the map and pulling herself to enemies, Dr. N. Tropy can hover and create energy balls that knock opponents away, Coco’s shields can keep other players off of platforms, and so on. Everybody feels useful in Crash Team Rumble, which is awesome because you only start with three of them: Crash, Dingodile, and Coco. You’ll have to unlock the rest. I don’t mind unlocking characters - this system makes it easy to learn each archetype’s ins and outs without overwhelming you - but it does lead to some issues Crash Team Rumble wouldn’t have if you could just pick whoever you wanted from the jump. The problem is that some characters just seem <i>better</i> than others, largely because of their movement abilities in a game about staying one step ahead of the other team, and a lot of those are the ones you have to unlock. Sure, Crash can do well in just about any match, but Tawna’s grappling hook lets her move faster than Crash can dream of and she has better options in combat. Catbat can fly, heal themself and their allies, and constantly divebomb you from the air. Catbat has the lowest health of the Scorers, but low health doesn’t matter when no one can catch you or knock you off the map. The other two archetypes have the same issue. Dr. Neo Cortex is fine, but I don’t know why you would use him when Coco has better abilities and more health – unless you just really like him from previous games. There’s a reason you see Coco in almost every match – a good player can take over a game and is almost impossible to KO. Dr. Neo Cortex, on the other hand, is far rarer. This problem is most noticeable in the Blocker role, however. My beloved Dingodile struggles against characters who have great mobility, like Catbat, and Dr. N. Brio is only really strong when he transforms. The best character of the group is easily Dr. N. Tropy, who has excellent mobility, good damage, and high health – and the only check on her power is that it takes way too long to unlock her by scoring badges by scoring badges as a Blocker. Gathering 15 Scorer or Booster badges is enough to unlock the next character in the other archetypes, but unlocking Dr. N. Tropy means accumulating a whopping <i>50 </i>Blocker badges, which takes <i>forever</i> and feels unfair given that it puts the most powerful character in the hands of only a few hardcore players. The unlock system isn’t a dealbreaker – again, every character seems viable and they’re all fun to play because of how unique they are – but it is annoying that the bar is set so high to even try out all of them. Every character also gets a Power that charges up throughout the match. They’re not character specific – you can choose from a list no matter who you’re playing as, but like characters, you can’t switch mid-match – but they can make all the difference in a close game. The Wumpa Stash builds up over time once you activate it, letting you score big when you turn in Wumpa if you can stay alive long enough. There’s also a refrigerator that will heal any allies, the Gasmoxian Guard, whose lightning pulses are great for holding areas or playing keepaway, and the Flytrap Spitter, which attacks enemies from range. My team has stolen several games because I saved my Gasmoxian Guard until the last second – it knocked the entire enemy team off our bank, allowing us to score for the win. The issue, again, is that some – like the Gasmoxian Guard, which you’ll see in literally every match – are just better than others and the unlock conditions are less than ideal. You earn them over time by turning in Relics at Relic Stations, but some require you to activate Common Relic Stations, and others need Epic Relic Stations. Because most games revolve around fighting over Epic Relic Stations, you’ll turn in a lot of those first. Unlocking the other Powers means focusing on activating Common Relic Stations, often at the expense of Relics that could be better spent on the Epic Relic Stations. So you have a choice: play the long game to unlock Powers like the Wumpa Stash, which are quite good, for use in later matches or spend your Relics in a way that’s more likely to win the game you’re in. It’s rough. What I like most about Crash Team Rumble, though, is its map design and how it forces you to use your character's skills. The maps here remind me of old-school arena shooters like Quake or Halo in that you’re always able to get to where you want to be quickly – and developing routes that maximize your Wumpa pickups, Relic collection, Gem activation, and drop-offs along the way feels as crucial to winning as knowing where and when weapons will spawn. Most surprisingly, I found that I enjoyed every single one. Usually there’s a stinker or two in any multiplayer game’s map rotation, but every map in Crash Team Rumble is distinct and fun to play. Some have a lot of tall structures and are cut into different segments, so positioning is key to winning fights. Others are flat and open, inviting all-out brawls. I prefer the more vertical maps like Surreal Summit, N. Sanity Caverns, and City Scrape, but I liked playing all of them because each requires a different strategy. Nine maps may not seem like a lot, but Toys for Bob has done a great job making colorful, creative, and memorable environments to explore in your battle for Wumpa Fruit. Naturally, there’s a Battle Pass, and each character can also be leveled up individually by completing challenges. Either way, the reward is the same: cosmetics. I’m not normally a fan of stuff like this, but Crash Team Rumble does it better than most games. It’s fun to dress Dingodile up like a hockey player, equip Tawna with a teddy bear backpack, or give Coco a cowboy hat. I’ve spent a lot of time with these characters and I enjoy going into a match knowing they’re <i>mine</i>, not a carbon copy of someone else’s or one of only a few skin options. I think what truly holds Crash Team Rumble back from greatness, though, is a lack of alternate game modes. There’s a tutorial, practice matches (which don’t allow you to make progress toward unlocking anything), private matches for friends, and competitive matches. That’s it. There are no other game types to fool around in and no distinction between casual and ranked play. While matchmaking is fast and going from one game to the next is a breeze, there just isn’t a lot here. Crash Team Rumble is a lot of fun, and it’s easy to get into the “just one more match” cycle that leads to staying up until three in the morning, but not even the best games can survive a lack of variety for long. Crash Team Rumble is a very tasty bite of Wumpa Fruit. I just wish it was more filling. Crash Team Rumble may not be a traditional Crash game, but it is a very fun one. Some characters and powers definitely seem to be stronger than others based on the fact that the community brings them into every single match, but everything and everyone is viable in the right hands. Matchmaking is a breeze, the maps are absolutely incredible, there’s a lot of depth for those who want to mine it, and it’s easy to lose yourself in the hunt for Wumpa Fruit for hours at a time, especially if you’re playing with friends. Even the cosmetic upgrades are fun to mess around with. But those hours come to a close a bit too soon due to a lack of game modes, limited matchmaking options, and an unlock system that is often downright annoying. That leaves Crash Team Rumble feeling a lot like Wumpa Fruit itself: it’s a great snack, and it’s got a lot of flavor, but you’ll probably be hungry again 30 minutes later. I know I was. "
Park Beyond ,5,"The magic of a park sim is its ability to make time disappear. When you are in the zone building your park, managing the wants and needs of your attendees, and creating a self-sustaining financial juggernaut, there’s potential for an almost euphoric Zen from the best of the genre. At its best, Park Beyond hits these highs with interesting rides, a simple and compelling upgrade system, and a whimsical sense of imagination. But, like a poorly maintained rollercoaster, there’s a looming threat that things will fall apart with disastrous results. It’s this tendency for things to come off the rails that left me feeling queasy after spending a few days in this park.   A game like this lives and dies by its building mechanics, and Park Beyond is pretty solid in that regard. Crafting a thriving and growing park from scratch is a lot of fun: building paths, flat rides, roller coasters, and shops is easy, thanks in part to a simple interface and controls that are straightforward when it comes to the simple stuff. After your grand opening there’s a linear, step-by-step process to upgrading and expanding your park that’s easy to understand and fun to execute. The capacity, and by extension income potential, of the park is limited at first. In the beginning there are only a few rides that can be built to entice customers. The amount of fun people have and the cleanliness of the park increases Park Appeal. Earn enough appeal and the park ranks up, increasing capacity and unlocking additional rides and shops. Which upgrades to select presents an interesting tactical choice. You can focus on obvious things, like unlocking shops to fulfill basic needs like food and drink and add some more basic ride options. Or you can be more strategic, unlocking options that appeal to a specific demographic (such as adults), or rides that prioritize fun over profitability to gamble that you can build a large base of customers quickly and then capitalize on them later. The moments when I’m clicking back and forth between different options, torn about what to select, is agonizing and engaging in the best way. The key differentiator between Park Beyond and other park sims is its fantasy concept of “impossificaiton.” As the amazement of your guests accumulates, you earn the ability to pull out a magic pencil and supercharge rides or employees. Suddenly that Shining Pendulum transforms into a colorful launcher of human-filled spinning tops, or that Ring of Fire loses the top of the arch, and launches riders from one side to the other while spinning like someone juggling on a turntable. It’s hilarious and wondrous, with a whimsical imagination that one would expect from a Roald Dahl book. I couldn’t help but smile the first time I impossified one of my janitors and he started cremating the nearby trash bins with a full on flamethrower. Some rides can even be impossified twice to become… impossibler? Each upgrade increases potential fun, amazement, and profit, but also adds to upkeep cost, and that’s unfortunately one of many areas where poor economic tuning becomes an issue for Park Beyond. Some rides become devastating financial drains after the upgrades, which turns the promise of a park filled with joyfully ludicrous machinery into a trap leading to financial ruin. Often the best long-term strategy is to play it safe with conventional rides, which can suck the soul out of these fantastical parks and reduce them to something run-of-the-mill.  That kind of oversight is unfortunately par for the course when it comes to the fiscal aspects of managing your park. Customer appeal, for instance, is unpredictable to the point of feeling random. A ride can be red hot one moment, then a money pit the next without any changes to ticket prices. Some evolution in park-goer taste over time makes sense, especially as rides age, but the wild swings from crowded to abandoned defy strategy, and mature parks have an unfortunate tendency to go from extremely positive cash flow to hemorrhaging money, seemingly in the blink of an eye and without explanation, which can be a miserable experience. What’s much more dependable are the roller coaster construction options, which should feel familiar to park sim veterans whether you’re building from scratch or selecting from prefabricated rides. Simple rail and chain lift options are enough to get a roller coaster going, and building simple rides is a breeze while more complex ones can be a challenge, as you’d expect. Unfortunately there’s an issue that crops up here as well when you get into the fancier options: there are enjoyably absurd modules that can fire cars out of cannons, or send them across open fields in giant hamster balls <i>a la</i> Jurassic World, but those come with the catch that getting tracks to point in the desired direction is like wrestling a fire hose. I often found myself giving up on opportunities to use the terrain in neat ways with tunnels, switchbacks, or loops, as the simple act of placing tracks became more trouble that it was worth. That stifled my more creative urges in a disappointing way. Even so, I was generally satisfied with the rides I was able to produce, but that just made the abysmal staff managing them that much more aggravating. Roles that keep your park clean and running are essential to earn income and raise your park appeal, but the people available to hire to do them operate with a terrible lack of basic sense. Is that ride shooting sparks and about to catch fire? Better fix up this seldom-used vending machine instead! Janitors will ignore heaps of litter in the streets to empty far-flung trash bins, and mechanics will ignore rides on the verge of collapse. That would be excusable if this were the kind of game where you could directly control them or manually set priorities, but no such options exist: you are fully at the mercy of the AI. The only solution is often to overstaff and hope for the best, which is a frustrating feeling when you are trying to grow your park on a shoestring budget.  Then there’s the park attendees themselves. They’re the true villains of Park Beyond, but through no fault of their own. The people you need to please and collect money from simply break at times. On several occasions I had a park that I thought was fully dialed in with great rides, plenty of food, drink, and bathroom options – earning strong metrics all around – only to have a total collapse of customer sentiment because entire crowds of people became frozen in place, unable to satisfy their basic needs or spend money at rides. Sometimes you can fix it by closing and reopening a ride, other times I had to delete chunks of my park, and in some cases I had to restart missions entirely. Eventually I just started checking every inch of my park for glitched attractions for customers every few minutes, a tedious necessity to keep things operating. That bugginess unfortunately doesn’t stop there. I’ve had immaculate parks’ scores ruined by invisible garbage, seen sidewalks disappear below ground, and entire shops lose their identity and become groups of dissociated parts. Some of these things are annoying, like employees getting stuck in the staff lounge until I delete it, and others are soul crushing, like the handful of hard crashes that undid untold amounts of focused park construction. It’s aggravating, and any large park feels like a ticking time bomb, ready to rob hours of work seemingly at random. Reverting to a manual or autosave is an option, but often introduces new bugs, and an inexplicably crashing balance sheet that had been healthy on the previous run through.  The threat of bugs dangles over you regardless of which of the two main modes you choose, but they do a good job mixing up the ways you can approach park building. First, there’s the Campaign, which throws you into eight increasingly difficult park-building scenarios, acting as a cross between a tutorial and story-driven challenge. While the story and characters are a forgettably generic group of scrappy park builders, the first few missions do a great job introducing a unique wrinkle that gives each one a different feel. One has you taking over a failing park that’s in need of your deft touch to turn it around. Another places you at the center of an archipelago, racing to earn money fast enough to buy the surrounding islands before they get turned into parking lots. It keeps things fresh and exciting, and makes for some good park-building puzzles.  The later missions, however, are a slog. The difficulty spikes considerably, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing when done well, but a slim margin of error just isn’t compatible with the unpredictable systems and unreliable tech. Rather than a triumphant culmination of all my skills, beating the last mission after about 40 hours felt more like the end of a prison sentence.  Sandbox is a much more consistent experience, and a more fun way to play. There are over two dozen maps to start with and build from. I like that you can assign yourself optional goals and starting funds, or just take unlimited money with no objectives and focus on creative freedom. This is where the whacky construction really shines, and it’s easy to lose hours (which, again, is the mark of a good park sim) to creating increasingly impossible roller coasters. It doesn’t have nearly as many customizations options as something like Planet Coaster, especially on the flat rides, but pulling the magic marker out and turning all the rides into delightful absurdities is well worth the tradeoff. Park Beyond does a great job tapping into the childhood whimsy that theme parks can elicit. There's a great sense of wonder to be had by impossifying rides, and the simple interface makes it easy to do. Incrementally unlocking new rides and increasing park capacity is rewarding, and creating something utterly ludicrous can be a blast. But that joy dissipates quickly when parks become unmanageable, as the attendees get stuck, staff ignores pressing needs, and financial ruin springs seemingly out of nowhere, while bugs and crashes make a late-campaign difficulty spike a miserable slog. Like riding an unfinished roller coaster, there’s fun to be had until the eventual crash, but it feels like this park just isn’t ready to be opened. "
F1 23 ,8,"After roughly 940 million kilometres, the Earth has reached the point on its 12-month celestial march around the sun where it’s time for another Formula 1 game. Fitting, perhaps, considering I feel like I’ve driven roughly 940 million kilometres in this series over the past decade-and-change. Jokes aside, it’s a testament to the incredible robustness of Codemasters’ brand of open-wheel motorsport magic that climbing back into the cockpit each year remains a pleasure, and F1 23 is no exception. Alongside noticeably improved handling for the new-era cars, F1 23 also adds the next chapter of the Braking Point story mode introduced in F1 2021 – plus a new reward-based progression system with daily, weekly, and seasonal goals. The result is plenty to keep us busy, even if your personal mileage may vary substantially depending on your taste in both curated, solo campaigns and live service-style game modes. Last season’s sweeping regulation changes ushered in a field full of brand-new F1 cars, and with their bigger wheels and tyres they were the best-looking cars the sport had seen in some time. However, they were also the heaviest cars in the championship’s history. In F1 22 this translated to a model that made manhandling that additional bulk quite tricky. Relearning the limits of these new cars was admittedly an absorbing challenge, but it wasn’t always a fun one; there was definitely a fickleness to the way the cars had a tendency to both understeer coming into corners and oversteer while trying to throttle out of them.  In F1 23, driveability has improved dramatically. There’s still a sensation of bulk here in the hefty new-era cars, but they feel considerably more cooperative; grippier and more stable, especially clipping kerbs. Better still, for those of you without a wheel there’s a truly excellent intuitiveness to the game pad controls this year. This was most evident to me while navigating slow corners in narrow street circuits and snapping out of early slides when getting on the throttle a little too hard. I don’t know if I’ve ever really been able to catch oversteer so effectively on a humble analogue stick in any F1 game, ever. F1 23 is easily the best the F1 series has ever felt on a traditional controller. The cars feel lively and dangerous, but they respect your commands. It’s like walking an obedient Dobermann through a butcher’s shop. Braking Point 2 is the continuation of the story Codemasters kicked off in F1 2021 and, despite the fact its 17 chapters ultimately only lasted me a few sessions over a couple of days, it’s definitely my favourite part of F1 23. For the purposes of a good yarn, Braking Point 2 adds a fictional eleventh team called Konnersport to the grid (much like we’ve been doing ourselves in My Team mode since F1 2020). The upshot here is that it seems to have resulted in a story with a bit more substance this time around. Emotion and conflict both run a little higher than I would suspect might have been possible within the bubble of an existing team with real-world sponsors. Also, while Braking Point 2 may move to a predictable enough conclusion, I was pleasantly surprised to be caught unawares by at least a couple of unexpected developments. While the original Braking Point concentrated on the chalk-and-cheese driving pair of rookie Aiden Jackson and retiring Dutch journeyman Casper Akkerman, Braking Point 2 broadens its lens. The focus here is really the whole Konnersport team, from the drivers (Jackson and his long-time nemesis Devon Butler) to likeable team principal Andreo Konner. Also in the frame is Davidoff Butler, Devon’s father and the CEO of Konnersport’s primary sponsor – plus up-and-coming F2 driver Callie Mayer, who’s being managed by Akkerman. As with the original Braking Point, the events in Braking Point 2 are a mix of scenarios with specific challenges to achieve as Jackson, Mayer, and even Devon Butler himself. Some events are full races but most are mid-race situations where you may find yourself asked to finish ahead of specific drivers or teams, salvage or defend your position after dealing with some bad luck, or capitalise on some smart strategy. Overachieving this time around can earn you bonus objectives, and doing so ranks you up within the story mode to unlock new responses to press questions and internal staff queries, but it doesn’t change the overall story – just minor side stories and conversations along the way. That said, I really like the structure; I appreciate the variety and I enjoy having goals. Make up so many spots. Don’t finish behind so-and-so. Maybe I just like being bossed around. Perhaps surprisingly considering his role in F1 2021, Jackson takes a bit of a backseat in Braking Point 2. This actually may be for the best as I found him even harder to warm to this time around, although some of that may be to do with the fact he’s still probably the least fleshed-out character. We learned very little about Jackson in the first Braking Point and we learn even less here. The spotlight instead has shifted to the ambitious Mayer and the smarmy Devon Butler. Intriguingly, while his stint as Braking Point’s heel continues, Devon easily emerges from Braking Point 2 as its most interesting and layered character. Braking Point 2’s cutscenes are a big improvement over the original and the facial performance capture in particular is far stronger. The interview sequences make for some clever script segues but I do wonder whether it would’ve benefited from a more documentary-style, fly-on-the-wall approach to the dramatic scenes also. The inability to prod the mode with the team you actually chose in the original is a minor miss, but it seems like it would’ve been an easy win for immersion’s sake. As it stands, the Braking Point 1 recap has Jackson and Akkerman wearing Alfa Romeo gear – in my game two years ago they drove for Haas. The other big new addition in F1 23 is F1 World, which is a standalone mode that appears to be built on the bones of the naff, lifestyle and apparel focused F1 Life mode from F1 22. You could probably describe F1 World as a secondary career mode where, instead of taking on traditional championship seasons, you complete a range of daily, weekly, and seasonal goals and races to earn rewards and upgrade your F1 World car. I don’t really know what to make of F1 World, but I do know I keep bouncing off it. I can certainly appreciate the appeal of a mode more suited to dipping in and out for short bursts of F1 action than the more time-consuming full race weekends in the normal career mode, but I’m just not attracted to the upgrade loop that comes alongside it. Upgrades in F1 World come in the form of miscellaneous and eccentric parts and performance boosters, like brakes that will make my tyres last a tiny bit longer – but only on North and South American racetracks. Or a bloke called Robert who will make my engine more powerful for 60 seconds after I make a pitstop, like some kind of motorsport warlock. There’s an elegance in having what’s essentially an evolving quick play mode all housed under a single umbrella that rewards you for time spent, but there’s a mobile game tone here that I’m just not sure I have the constitution for. If you’re in the same boat, the traditional career and My Team modes remain present. Just know they’re essentially the same as last year, only with some extra tracks: Lusail and Las Vegas. It’s hard to say what kind of race the Vegas Strip street course will make for in real life this November but it’s a cracking-looking track in F1 23, daubed in a busy neon background and brimming with verticality just beyond the track boundaries. It’s extremely eye-catching.  F1 23 is a far heartier package than F1 22, with 26 tracks, the enjoyable next chapter of the Braking Point story mode that began in F1 2021, and – for players who love to recline back into the couch and race – the best gamepad handling in the series, ever. The racing-focused secondary career mode F1 World is also likely to be a step in the right direction after last year’s F1 Life for some, although it's equally probable its arcade-inspired, loot-based upgrade system will be divisive amongst traditionalists.

Amnesia: The Bunker ,8,"a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/09/03/amnesia-the-dark-descent-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Amnesia: The Dark Descent</a> changed the face of horror games 13 years ago, and 2020's <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/amnesia-rebirth-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Amnesia: Rebirth</a> seemed to bring the story seeds it planted to a bone-chilling and climactic final bloom. So Amnesia: The Bunker, a smaller and more self-contained chapter, has its work cut out for it in getting me excited about this frightening franchise again. And while a lot of the fundamentals of its stealth and exploration have stayed the same as they were when I woke up as Daniel more than a decade ago, this gloomy, open-ended cat-and-mouse thriller proves you can teach an old hellbeast some new tricks. Set in a dim, doomed World War I bunker in 1916, we take on the role of a French soldier who is wounded in battle, and wakes to find the exits destroyed and nearly all of his comrades-in-arms slaughtered by something lurking in the dark. The first and biggest shake-up to the usual Amnesia routine is that the entire bunker, which feels bigger than it looks on paper, is available to explore from fairly early on. Similar to Metroid or Resident Evil, you'll have to track down a small arsenal of tools to access certain areas and progress the story, but you're given very little direction in terms of where to go next. This helps to build tension, because every expedition out of the lamp-lit central safe room is a drain on your very limited resources, and probably your resolve, too.  Whereas most enemies in other Amnesia games are scripted to patrol a specific area in a specific way, The Bunker takes a refreshing page out of Alien: Isolation’s book and features a single, ever-present threat called the Stalker that lives behind the walls and above the ceiling of your concrete prison. It's attracted to noise, which can be anything from running, to firing off a weapon, to using your hand-cranked flashlight. The fact that its behavior is somewhat unpredictable dials up the dread and adds some much-needed dynamism. And you'll know when you've gotten its attention by scraping and growling that use effective sound design to further fuel your paranoia. Amnesia made a name for itself as a horror game with no weapons, so it seemed odd to me at first that The Bunker hands you a pistol and even sometimes grenades. But the joke was really on me as these can, at best, make the Stalker leave you alone for a few minutes. Munitions are situationally useful, but ultimately end up making the foe even scarier. After all, what's worse? A monster you can't fight at all, or one you've seen can take a bullet to the face and merely get a bit annoyed? Where this beastie failed to impress me, though, was its AI. The alien in Isolation would slowly learn more about you the more times you encountered it, especially if you had a go-to strategy like hiding in lockers. The Stalker, sadly, doesn't seem nearly as savvy. On the default difficulty, in almost all cases, I could simply crouch under a table and it would never find me even if I was practically breathing on its ankles. Figuring that out deflates a good bit of the tension The Bunker worked so hard to build. Luckily, it has another, clever way of making you sweat even if you're an expert at hiding. See, the whole bunker is powered by a central generator that guzzles down fuel like a thirsty elephant, and there are only so many refills available on the whole map. You can explore without the lights on, but it's… well, it's very bad. The Stalker is free to roam the halls in the darkness, whereas it would normally stay in its tunnels until it detects you. Worse, your only reusable source of light is that stupid flashlight that makes a bunch of noise and alerts it to your position. What this means is every trip out into the far corners of the bunker comes with a sense of urgency and purpose, embodied by a pocket watch you can sync up to the amount of remaining fuel to know how much time you have before lights out. If you choose to hide every time the Stalker is around, you'll be burning a precious resource, as it can sometimes take a minute or two for it to stop patrolling and go back into the tunnels. This is definitely The Bunker's most effective new trick for making me feel the way the first Amnesia did all over again. The story is a relatively simple one, especially compared to the interdimensional cosmic nightmare that was Rebirth. A timeline of events slowly comes into focus as you find notes written by the various enlisted men and officers who once called this box a home away from home. There is a fairly clever twist toward the end that managed to subvert my expectations as an Amnesia veteran. Whereas the past games have largely been about remembering and coming to terms with your character's sins, that's merely a prelude to what The Bunker actually has in store. There are certainly some little peeks into the larger Amnesia universe, but I found it refreshing how much smaller and more self-contained this tale is. If you did play Rebirth, you'll be rewarded by understanding the context behind some of the weirder stuff that shows up. And if you didn't, you'll get to be surprised and perplexed by these moments in a way I wasn't. Then you should probably go play Rebirth so you can understand what is actually going on. I found the ending itself extremely predictable though. If you think about what you're doing throughout The Bunker for even a second, I imagine most people will be aware of what ""escape"" would actually mean the whole time. But it is still effective, reminding us that we, as humans, can create horrors far worse than any writer's most eldritch imaginings. And knowing where it's going certainly doesn't spoil the journey. As a final little twist, a lot of stuff in The Bunker, including the monster's behavior, locker codes, and the location of some key items, are semi-randomized on every playthrough. This is supposed to keep things interesting if you decide to replay it. I didn't feel like there were especially compelling reasons to do so, but it's nice to know if I ever get the itch that I won't just be speedrunning through the same route again. A first playthrough ran me about eight hours by Steam's count, but only around five by the in-game clock, which no doubt has something to do with how many times I tabbed out to look at funny animal videos to get my stress under control. There's also one irritating little technical issue: When transitioning between areas, the screen hangs as it loads in, sometimes for up to a couple seconds and even when installed on a fast SSD. Considering these areas aren't very big, and developer Frictional’s games don't exactly look like Crysis, this seems poorly justified. I can't say Amnesia is still a groundbreaking horror franchise like it was at the beginning. The larger story it was building has already been played out with Rebirth. But Amnesia: The Bunker proves that smaller, anthology-style episodes within its universe can still bring the tension and the scares. And Frictional's bag of tricks is far from exhausted when it comes to getting our hearts pounding and making us carefully consider how to use the limited tools available to us. It's not an unmissable experience, but as an Amnesia fan, it definitely sated my appetite for some gut-churning horror and moody, bleak storytelling. "
System Shock ,9,"Trapped in a hell he helped make, a lone hacker aboard a space station far from home sneaks and fights his way through horrible mutants and killer robots in order to take down the monstrous artificial intelligence behind it all: SHODAN, one of the all-time great gaming villains. System Shock pioneered so many first-person shooter concepts back in 1994 that now feel fundamental, simultaneously paving the way for the entire immersive sim genre. Nightdive Studios has done masterful work with this 2023 remake, taking a fantastic game that the years have made hard to play and updating it with modern conveniences that will let it be enjoyed for decades to come. Nominally a shooter, System Shock is more about exploring the labyrinth that is the TriOptimum corporation's Citadel space station than any combat that takes place within it. Your Hacker and their military-grade neural implant are responsible for the significantly degraded situation here, having disabled the AI SHODAN's ethical limitations. So, naturally, SHODAN has chopped everyone into bits and stitched them back together as horrible cyborgs, made her own strain of a world-ending mutagenic virus complete with freaky mutants, and now wants to export her godlike divinity to Earth proper. We love SHODAN for this, because she's just so delightfully unnerving while she does it. Evil artificial intelligences can often be depicted as cold, calculating super geniuses – SHODAN isn't that. SHODAN is completely, transparently bonkers, inflicted with the delusion that she is a god and delightfully obsessed with both herself and her often extremely bad plans.  If SHODAN's body is the giant Citadel space station, then you are a horrible little parasite killing her from the inside out. Figuring out the extent of her plans and then foiling them is what you do. System Shock is old school in the oldest-school way, with levels that are deliberately-designed mazes of interconnecting corridors, rooms, and locked gates. It's basic design that holds up thirty years and a hefty visual update later, giving you a space to delve out that's hard to navigate by its nature and providing a very satisfying challenge to learn your way around. There isn’t really any main-quest hand holding, no log of what you're doing next (though there is now an optional difficulty setting to change that), so stopping SHODAN means you actually have to explore, listen to audio logs, and figure out what plans the now-dead crew had cooked up. The awesome setting and style as you poke around is fuelled by one hundred per cent pure grade uncut spaceborne cyberpunk <i>vibes</i>. Cyberware? We’ve got that. Cool smart guns? We’ve got those as well. An evil corporation-turned-government? But of course. The revamped visuals and effects are great, and I loved the semi-pixelated textures and blocky objects at work, probably best exemplified in the power interface panels. The new music and sounds are a superb accompaniment, too. It all works together to remind you that you're still playing a game that's 30 years old, but that this version of it has been brought forward in time for you to more easily see what made it so special in the first place. You can even tweak the interface color if phosphor green isn't your thing. As you might expect, you are going to have to bash, shoot, burn, and blow up some nasty monsters to escape Citadel. While the heart of System Shock is undoubtedly exploration, there's still a lot of fighting to do along the way, with some enemies requiring a pure firefight to take down while others necessitate the exploitative stealth ambushes of a survival horror game instead. Brute force won’t always work, so you’ll often have to cleverly sneak around corners and through maintenance shafts to take down enemies that are far tougher and more dangerous than you are. Combat is probably the place where this new System Shock changes most from the original game. Enemies were previously fairly slow and unintelligent, and the whole concept of what a first-person shooter even was hadn’t been nailed down in the way it is today. That meant many of the coolest weapons on paper were hard to use in practice, and enemies weren't very good at fighting back. Most experienced players would just run at everything and rip it to pieces with the Laser Rapier, a kind of electro-charged lightsaber, but that’s no longer as much of a viable option. That's not to say the Laser Rapier is weak now. Please note: The Laser Rapier is still awesome. But <i>other</i> weapons are cool now, too. I don't think I ever did anything with a grenade but kill myself in the original, whereas this time around I not only used them, I got to fire them out of a really cool grenade launcher. Other weapons like the magnum and assault rifle also come into their own thanks to more modern design sensibilities, and for the first time I felt like System Shock was a real FPS. It's a testament to how thorough and thoughtful this remake is that I kept having to check if certain weapons and moments were in the original at all. The new stuff just feels completely natural. The cyborgs, mutants, and robots that serve SHODAN have received even bigger improvements. The clunky movements of times past are long gone in favor of enemies with proper AI that know how to maneuver out of your line of fire, duck behind obstacles, and rush you in groups. The gruesomely gooey spliced-together cyborgs are really the ones that benefit most from their visual upgrade, going from kinda-goofy movie frankensteins to brainwashed surgical nightmares. I really appreciated the unique designs that went into how each of these enemies fights and behaves, too. The jury-rigged work robots rush at you, as do the more brainless mutants, but most of the cyborgs will try to out-shoot you. The heavily armored enemies will move implacably towards you, shooting all the while, before ripping you apart in melee. Bosses that were once simply tedious encounters – like the vicious Cortex Reavers, militarized gun platforms powered by an unwilling human host – are now tense fights that require you to gather the right equipment from around the station to win, and probably not without dying a few times. On death, you revive at the nearest medical chamber you've unlocked, gear and equipment intact. It's a pleasant respawn mechanic that punishes without ever frustrating and serves the goal of encouraging you to explore really nicely. Rushing through levels can work, but it's easier if you've found a way to revive nearby when you accidentally step off a platform and fall to your death. It's a nice bit of older design that aged well, which is good because how you move around the station <i>hasn’t</i>. Your hacker's movements can at times feel clunky and slow, unable to perform some actions that have become staples of modern games like sliding down ladders. That one I can forgive, but I'm not sure we needed to be forced to crouch-jump in order to get on top of objects anymore – that's a bit of old game wisdom best left in the past. Speaking of the very few things I didn't like: Cyberspace. At certain points in System Shock you find terminals that let you enter the station's cyberspace mainframe, where reality is instead a kind of “six degrees of freedom” shooter with mediocre wireframe graphics. Questionably, but perhaps to its credit, the remake is very faithful to these sections by leaving them intact, but that still doesn't change the fact that they could often bore me to tears. Extremely to its credit, however, the remake lets you adjust individual difficulty settings for four separate areas of gameplay: combat, puzzles, cyberspace, and the main story missions. If you dislike exploring blindly and scouring audio logs, the lowest mission difficulty will give you clearer directions to follow. If you, like me, hate cyberspace, just turn the difficulty down and quickly blaze through those bits. If you want a more hardcore survival experience, you can crank up the combat and get absolutely dunked on by Cortex Reavers. I did this and it ruled. I do expect that the most commonly tweaked difficulty will be puzzles, however. The Pipe-Dream-esque power rerouting minigame is ubiquitous in System Shock, and second to finding a security access keycard is needed to open many doors and activate pieces of sensitive equipment that have been locked off. I find these puzzles almost therapeutic. They ask you to step back, take your time, and let your pulse settle after being chased around by, for example, two-faced zebra gorilla mutants. I also just really like the clacky in-world interface of plugging and unplugging power cables. Where many modern games invite you to sit back and enjoy the ride, System Shock wants you to sit up and experience the SHODAN. Tweaking the technical workings of Citadel station to come out on top and foil SHODAN's machinations is just as compelling as it ever was, making the original System Shock one of gaming's classics for a very good reason. Nightdive's remake masterfully brings most of the aspects that haven’t aged as well into the present day, with excellent new graphics and nearly all the modern gameplay conveniences you could want. Get out there and give her hell, hacker. "
Diablo 4 ,9,"Like seeing your favorite band play their greatest hit live, Diablo 4 is completely awesome to behold even though you know exactly how the song’s going to go from the moment you hear the first iconic note. Diablo 4 doesn’t do much to reinvent ARPGs or push the boundaries of a genre its series helped pioneer, but the tweaks, improvements, and borrowed ideas it does introduce have forged this latest model into the best Diablo we’ve ever had. The finely-tuned combat, extensive build options across each class, stellar graphics, and strong live-service foundation are all among the most impressive in the genre, and the endgame activities and grind are so well thought out that I struggle to find any fault in them – as rare an occurrence as rainfall on Mars. A weak story and some irritating bugs do occasionally throw a wet blanket over the fires of Hell, but the 80 hours I’ve spent in Sanctuary have still been overwhelmingly positive, and even after all that demon slaying and obsessing over loot rolls, I’m still very excited to play a whole lot more. Diablo 4 is the latest in a demon-centric series quickly approaching its 30th birthday, and it largely succeeds at modernizing the depths of Hell enough to finally match its more recent ARPG peers. You’re once again sent on an endless string of dungeon crawls where mastering your hotkey-bound abilities, optimizing your DPS, and improving your survivability are generally more important than things like an engaging story or explaining the insane diarrhea of flickering lights and elemental effects that typically occupy the screen – and practically every moment of that is really, really enjoyable whether you’re playing alone or with up to three friends. Running dungeons captures that familiar but just as compelling loop of killing hordes of enemies, completing objectives, and downing bosses, and running sidequests to learn more about the world’s lore and characters is usually a very good time even while the main plot meanders.  If you were hoping Diablo 4 would shock the ARPG world with massive innovations to the genre, however, you’re likely to be disappointed in that specific regard. Instead of trying to revolutionize ARPGs in any major way, Blizzard mostly seems content to play it safe by making smart but unsurprising changes to the formula, with things like more customizable skill trees and more diverse playstyles between its iconic character classes. This series had a lot of catching up to do in the 11 years since Diablo 3, and whether it’s borrowing combat inspiration from Path of Exile or online elements from <a href=""/lost-ark/53977/review/lost-ark-review"">Lost Ark</a>, there isn’t really anything about what Diablo 4 does so well that is completely unprecedented. But while there may not be much in the way of game-changing innovations, the good news is that lack of experimentation has resulted in a game that’s unbelievably well-designed and succeeds at practically everything it tries. I’m one of those weirdos who actually closely follows the story in Diablo, and although Diablo 4’s probably isn’t going to win any awards, it is still a massive step in the right direction compared to its predecessor. The quest to find and stop Lilith, daughter of one of the Prime Evils of Hell, after she unleashes her fury upon Sanctuary serves as a fantastic kicking off point that I was still eager to unravel even after my eighth playthrough of the first act during the pre-launch beta. Gone are the days of WWE-like voice performances and dreadfully cheesy dialogue, and the queen of succubi is one of the most complex villains the series has ever seen, with motivations that even made me question the justness of my own cause. But before you get any real payoff for what’s expertly set up in the first act, you’ll spend the vast majority of the next four going on tangentially related errands with more filler than a packing peanut factory, before finally getting back to the task at hand. The result is an interesting but disjointed story with a payoff that doesn’t quite stick the landing. The real shame is that anytime Lilith is on-screen or closely involved in whatever action is going on, it’s absolutely engrossing stuff. But she’s largely hidden behind a curtain waiting for the final act for the vast majority of the campaign, and the diversions you’re sent on along the way consistently feel like unnecessary detours. Combine that with some seriously disappointing boss fights I won’t spoil, especially the campaign’s final one, and it’s hard not to feel let down by what this <i>could</i> have been. It does help that Diablo 4 looks and sounds fantastic regardless of what’s going on in the story. Between the rare but breathtaking CGI cutscenes and the more numerous in-engine cutscenes that happen in between major story missions, as well as the detailed, disgustingly corrupted environments found in dungeons and out in the world, Sanctuary is rarely not a gorgeous sight to behold. It’s no small feat, then, that Diablo 4 sounds even better than it looks, with one of the most memorable OSTs in recent memory, mostly great voice acting, and lots of gross demon roars and shrieks as you lay waste to the minions of Hell. The ending of the story at least nicely sets up a whole host of possibilities for Diablo 4’s live-service future and inevitable story expansions, but I find myself excited about the potential of where things might go more than I am happy about the base campaign we got overall. It’s no wonder that Blizzard allows you to skip the campaign entirely for every character you make after the first time you complete it – a five-minute recap video would be just as effective as replaying the roughly 15-hour story. That might have been more disappointing if the brief campaign were meant to be the main course of this meal, but thankfully rolling credits in a Diablo game means you’ve only just finished the appetizer. When it comes to the things that really matter in the long run like combat, buildcrafting, hunting for gear, and especially the endgame, Diablo 4 absolutely knocks it out of the park in practically every way. Even if they aren’t <i>perfectly </i>balanced, all five character classes are a ton of fun to play as. The rogue darts around to deal extreme damage either in melee or from afar with a deadly bow in an exhilarating high risk/high reward tradeoff; The sorcerer creates horrifying cocktails of destruction, like an absolutely disgusting lightning build I brewed up to stun everything around me constantly; The necromancer raises an army of the dead, steals life, and manipulates the corpses of fallen enemies to carry out their foul desires, for when I’m in the mood to keep my distance and let someone else do the hard work for me; When I just want to Hulk my way through the depths of Hell, the barbarian is an expert in all forms of smashing who can charge forward to destroy everything in their path; And the druid uses their Animorph abilities and the power of mother nature to wail on all manner of demons, with probably the most build diversity of any of the classes. Part of what helps make each option feel unique are the class mechanics that unlock at various points in the campaign. For example, the Sorceress gains access to the enchantment system in Act I, which allows you to enchant a couple of their spells to augment how they work. I used one of my enchantments on my teleport spell to turn the standard dodge every class gets into a second teleport cooldown, greatly improving my mobility. Each class has their own unique twist, whether it’s augmenting your ranks of the dead as a necromancer or bonding with spirit animals to gain beastly enhancements as a druid, and that goes a long way to making your playthrough and buildcrafting on each character feel distinct in some really cool ways. Gear can also substantially affect the paths you might choose to take a character down. For example, after completing a job for a demented tree, you could be rewarded with a magical pair of pants that heals you over time when standing close to enemies, warranting a shift in your build from slaying enemies from afar to something close quarters. Or maybe, like me, you’ll get devilishly lucky when you find a weapon that has a chance of casting a random lightning spell for free whenever you cast an initial one, leading to absolute mayhem when you bring your electrical might to bear upon an unsuspecting huddle of bandits. There’s so much to like about Diablo Immortal that it really pains me to see it so close and yet so far from being a game I can heartily recommend. As a casual, purely free-to-play experience it offers a lot to do, with its empowering ARPG combat and interesting skill system, whereas for those that want to be competitive in PVP it quickly becomes restrictive, punitive, and money-grubbing. And for everyone in between? It just doesn’t offer good value for money spent. If the Empowered Battle Pass and Boon of Plenty offered more, I could definitely see myself renewing them each season and steadily working my way through the many difficulty levels as I ascend Immortal’s 600 paragon levels, and gradually – oh so gradually – ranking up my legendary gems. Instead, that dream is so far out of reach that it’s not feasible, and the further in I get the less the rewards offered by those paid services are actually likely to be meaningful. I’m still going to keep playing Diablo Immortal, but without overhauls to the monetisation and the many restrictions, it’s going to be a dip in, dip out game, as opposed to a world I want to live in. <i>- Cam Shea, June 1, 2022</i Read our full <a href=""/diablo-immortal/56815/review/diablo-immortal-review-in-progress"">Diablo Immortal Review</a>. Trying out new builds and experimenting with powerful new pieces of equipment is one of the best parts of Diablo 4, and I spent most of my time on my sorcerer, where I continuously discovered new and extremely rude ways to be the best glass cannon I could be, like equipping an ice shield that froze enemies for the sin of attacking me to remove said shield. The variety of systems available to optimize your character are so numerous that it can be pretty dizzying at first, even for a Diablo veteran like me, but when properly mastered this is easily one of the best buildcrafting toolboxes of all time. Whether it’s the dense skill trees, the endgame paragon boards and powerful glyphs that can be upgraded and socketed into them, the plethora of loot options across various world tiers and rarity levels, the gems and vendor upgrades you can use to make that equipment even better, or the fact that gear perks can be tweaked to optimize them for a certain build, Blizzard seems to have thought of just about everything. And all that control meant I never came close to feeling like my time wasn’t being respected when a loot drop didn’t happen to go my way. There are just so many ways to interact with your build and make smart use of your gear. For example, whenever I outleveled a cool piece of gear with an effect I loved, I could extract its key perk and keep it in my inventory to be imprinted on a more powerful piece of equipment down the road. And thankfully, Blizzard has backed down from its previous promises to make skill tree respecs prohibitively expensive. Instead, they merely hurt your in-game wallet enough that switching high-level characters to a new build is a serious consideration, but not one that’s impossible or sends you straight to the poor house. After 80 hours on a single character, I was still discovering new ways to tweak and improve my build or new equipment perks that opened up exciting possibilities. That makes it very difficult to log off even when I found myself playing nearly until the sun came up once or twice. Running through murky halls with my decked out murder machines feels significantly more streamlined since the dungeon tweaking Blizzard rolled out in response to feedback from the beta weekends, with far less backtracking and wasted time. That keeps things moving along at a great pace and makes diving into the bone-riddled halls of an ancient tomb or what I can only assume is a demon body parts exhibit a consistent joy. No matter what class you’ve chosen, shredding your way through piles of wretched reprobates is usually effortless fun that lets you flex your unrivaled power, though some of the more difficult activities like Nightmare Dungeons are bound to put those skills to the test. There’s also a good chance you’ll run into a random event that might have you rescuing some poor souls who find themselves lost in a crypt, or get attacked by The Butcher, a familiar demon who enjoys meat hooks more than I thought possible. Admittedly, regular minions have very few unique mechanics I could discern in the few seconds it took to send them back to Hell with my coldest regards. Most just run at you while yelping or hurdle some pointy object at you from nearby, which doesn’t make them feel all that different to fight even when they are part of some distinct and cool-looking enemy faction. But you do get the occasional breath of fresh air, like shamans that summon new enemies to the battlefield, making their summary executions a high priority, or skeletons that slowly shamble toward you with big, beefy shields until you’re able to tear through their defenses and finish them off. Dungeon bosses have a bit of a similar inconsistency – I can only fight so many big, floating demon wizards called “The Curator” or some such nonsense before it all just blends together into one big pile of satisfyingly defeated gore. But others are much more memorable, like one where a laughing cultist repeatedly summoned waves of freaks until he ran out of steam and was quickly turned into a bowl of mashed potatoes by me and my friends. Speaking of friends, Diablo 4 is great for making them, as an online connection is required to push back the forces of evil. While this comes with the expected but rare hitches like getting disconnected from the live servers in the middle of your adventures or having to wait in short queues to get play during a particularly busy time, the benefits far exceed the drawbacks. There’s a much greater sense of discovery now as you encounter other players out in the wild (or murder them in cold blood in a PvP zone), and those chance encounters when you’re taking down a world boss, for example, can turn into new online friends. It’s especially cool that trading and clans seem to have greatly increased in prominence compared to previous Diablo games, and there’s a real sense of community around taking down endgame group activities together and helping one another optimize your builds. That’s the kind of magic you can get in an online game and I’m very excited to see what ridiculous shenanigans the community gets into. Optimizing your build and coordinating with your squad means nothing if there aren’t endgame activities waiting to be conquered, and Diablo 4 has quite possibly the best day-one endgame experience I’ve seen. Once you’ve beaten the campaign, you’ll be able to run bounties for the Tree of Whispers, an evil plant with dismembered heads hanging from it, which spawns new activities infinitely in exchange for high-level loot drops. Doing so at higher world tiers (essentially harder difficulties) also gives you keys to Nightmare Dungeons, which are more challenging versions of existing levels that add crazy stuff like an invincible crystal that magically chases you around the entire time trying to crush you and your dreams while you fight suped-up versions of the dungeon’s enemies and bosses. I was around level 43 when I finished the campaign, but at level 50, you’ll also be ready to tackle the first Capstone Dungeon – a mostly by-the-numbers dungeon that serves as a power and skill check in order to unlock the third world tier, and which grants access to a variety of new activities and loot drop ranks. Some of those are called Helltide Events, a completely awesome type of activity where blood begins raining from the skies in certain zones, and uber-deadly enemies swarm everywhere. Killing them and collecting nonsensically named Aberrant Cinders without dying allows you to open special chests that are positively crammed with sacred loot. But PvP is possibly the endgame activity with the longest tail. You’ll find two PvP zones in Sanctuary where you compete to slay NPC enemies to collect materials while keeping your head on a swivel to defend against rival players who might decide to kill you and take your resources for themselves. Running around in these chaotic zones is completely nerve-wracking and hilarious, especially since even your own party members can betray you by scooping up the valuable materials that are not shared between players, leading to rifts in even the strongest alliance – you might even be tempted to leave the party to rid yourself of that pesky friendly fire protection and lash out at a former ally. Then at level 70, you get another Capstone Dungeon to unlock the final world tier, which gives you access to even better loot, tougher enemies, and more XP, and, there’s <i>yet another</i> final endgame dungeon designed for level 100 characters after that – the treadmill of things to conquer is so well designed I didn’t want to get off even when I felt like I had seen 95% of what was on offer. The whole time you work towards the max level of 100, you’re earning Paragon points to make your character ever more deadly against your increasingly formidable foes, which serve as a carrot to keep grinding your way through Tree of Whisper Bounties, Helltide Events, and PvP zones. Even after more than 80 hours on my primary character I haven’t reached level 100 yet, but there is a cap on both leveling and earning additional Paragon points once you do, a smart move away from Diablo 3’s philosophy of letting players earn nigh-endless stat increases in favor of a system that forces you to make meaningful choices with the limited upgrades your Paragon Boards can contain. I prefer that approach to the bloated monsters that Diablo 3 characters were known to become, and the endgame grind to reach that max level is practically perfect in terms of variety, replayability, buildcrafting, and more. Even if you somehow run out of things to do in the endgame for one character, rolling a second or third character instantly becomes a fresh experience since the campaign is optional and many unlocks like Altars of Lilith (fonts of power hidden throughout Sanctuary) and potions/skill points granted from gaining renown in regions of the map are account-wide bonuses that instantly apply to your character. The most important of these instant unlocks is your mount, which allows your new characters to hop on a horse and race off to faraway parts of the map so you can begin leveling by playing whichever activities you want, rather than being stuck to the campaign’s railroad tracks every time you want to try out a new class. Tackling dungeons or participating in PvP from the fresh perspective of a whole new class immediately shakes off any dust Diablo 4’s lengthy grind might gather and extends the good times even further than I thought possible. The retail version of Diablo 4 will include a digital store where players can spend real-world money on cosmetic items for their in-game characters, as well as a battle pass with both free and paid tiers of rewards. Unfortunately, these weren’t available in the review build we were given access to, so we don’t know the specifics of what items will be sold, how much they will cost, or if they’ll even look interesting enough to be worth the price. Blizzard has at least <a href=""/diablo-iv/66034/news/diablo-4-battle-pass-will-take-around-80-hours-to-complete""><u>clearly stated</u></a> that the online store will only contain items that are purely cosmetic, with no impact on actual gameplay, and will include a small selection at first which will be expanded in future seasons, but for now that’s all we know. That means there isn’t necessarily a ton of cause for alarm at the moment, but we won’t know for sure if there are any problematic aspects hiding in these systems until we are able to see them for ourselves at launch. The best part about Diablo 4’s endgame successes, though, is that all of it’s built upon a live-service foundation that will allow the world, meta, and activities to evolve over time. Whether or not that model will be updated with content frequently enough to keep people interested remains to be seen, but even without it, the vanilla endgame experience is strong enough on its own. I can only imagine how exciting it’ll be when new experiences are added to the Diablo 4 playground that challenge your maxed out characters in exciting ways and expand upon the story or available character classes. Live-service games get a lot of hate nowadays, and I understand why when there are so many recent examples of how not to do them (I’m looking at you, CrossfireX). But that model can also breathe endless life into a game when done right – we don’t know yet if Blizzard will do it justice, but right now I couldn’t be happier that the groundwork has at least been well laid for Diablo 4 to potentially thrive going forward. Hopefully some of those updates come sooner rather than later, too, as Diablo 4 does suffer from a few nasty bugs at the moment. For example, if you enjoy teleporting around as a sorcerer, be prepared to get stuck in the ground literally hundreds of times, as Blizzard apparently didn’t account for vertical geometry changes when zipping around the top-down levels. Thankfully the issue can be resolved by just teleporting back to town, but it also forced me to retrace my steps to my original location, wasting tons of time…only for it to happen again when I teleported a few minutes later. There’s also some weird rubberbanding that sometimes goes on when you try to go from one region to another that prevents you from entering a zone. In some instances, my friends and I had to use one another as teleporting waypoints to get into regions we were completely unable to enter. Most of Diablo 4’s issues are extremely specific things that will likely get patched, but they were bad enough to tangibly impact my enjoyment a bit in the meantime. Diablo 4 is a stunning sequel with near perfect endgame and progression design that makes it absolutely excruciating to put down. The story is a pretty big disappointment despite still being a noticeable improvement over Diablo 3 and there are some annoying bugs that need squashing, but the combat, the loot game, and both the sights and sounds of this world are impressive enough to smooth over those rough edges. Diablo 4 takes the strategy of refining things the series already did so well rather than giving it a more substantial overhaul, and that careful and reverent path has shaped this massive sequel into one of the most polished ARPGs ever created, which makes slicing through the legions of the damned a hell of a good time.

Street Fighter 6 ,9,"Remember when Street Fighter 5 came out and a lot of people were disappointed by its distinct lack of meat on its bones? Street Fighter 6 is the polar opposite. Complete with an excellent 18-character roster of both new and returning fighters rendered in a killer new art style, an incredibly ambitious online Battle Hub that puts all other online fighting game lobby systems to shame, and just about everything you could ever ask for when it comes to training tools and systems to help you get better at fighting games, it’s a spectacularly feature-rich fighting game. Street Fighter 6 takes many swings in many different directions, and though not every blow connects, the ones that do are absolute knockouts. The gameplay of every Street Fighter game since Street Fighter 2 can generally be defined by a unique mechanic. Street Fighter 3 had parries, 4 had focus attacks, 5 had the V-System, and now Street Fighter 6 has the Drive System. And for my money, it’s the best the series has ever seen.  Every character gains access to five powerful abilities that are all governed by their Drive Gauge: Overdrive special moves, Drive Rush, Drive Parry, Drive Reversals, and Drive Impact. Overdrives are essentially the new EX Special Moves and cost two bars, Drive Rush allows you to quickly close the distance between you and your opponent at the cost of one bar (or cancel out of specific normal attacks at the cost of three bars), Drive Reversals allow you to get an opponent off of you while you’re blocking their attack at the cost of two bars, and Drive Impacts… well we’ll get into those in a bit. I love this system for a lot of reasons, but chief among them is that it opens up so many options, and at the start of every round you have a full meter and have access to all of them. There’s no building this meter up, or worrying about the amount you’ll have left over for the next round. I could start aggressively by using a Drive Rush right out of the gate to put on pressure; I could save my meter for Overdrive special moves to increase the damage of my combos; or I could fish for a crouching medium kick and then Drive Rush cancel it to convert big damage off of a single hit. Those are just a few of the options, and managing them makes the already extremely cerebral fighting of Street Fighter 6 even more enjoyable. The way it’s handled when you run out of Drive Meter is also excellent: your character enters a Burnout state where you’re completely unable to use any Drive Meter-related techniques; your opponent’s attacks become more advantageous on both block and hit; you take chip damage, and Drive Impacts are even scarier than before (I swear, we’ll get to Drive Impacts in just a bit). Being in Burnout is a terrible position, but it is far from an unwinnable situation. You still move at the same speed, your attacks do the same damage, you still have access to all of your super moves, and while your opponent’s Drive Impacts are a huge threat, you know that they’ll be looking to do them, which can lead to some interesting mind games on both sides. Some of the most tense and fun matches I’ve had in Street Fighter 6 have been when I managed to pull out a victory even while in Burnout. Now let’s talk about Drive Impact, because I have a feeling that for a lot of people, whether or not they enjoy Street Fighter 6 is largely going to come down to their feelings on this one move. Drive Impact only costs one bar of drive meter to use, it has super armor that can absorb up to two hits, and if it hits while your opponent is in the middle of their own attack they will be knocked into a crumpled state, giving you a full combo. And that’s not at all! Even if they block it they get blown back and lose half a bar of Drive Meter, and if they get backed into the corner you get to follow it up with a combo. That’s not all either! Remember how I said that they’re even more scary when you’re in Burnout? Well, if you block a Drive Impact and you’re close to the wall you get stunned and you’ll eat a full combo in the corner, even though you blocked their attack. It’s one of the most powerful universal mechanics I’ve ever seen in a fighting game, and if you don’t respect it, you will get crushed by it. And yet, I love Drive Impacts, because they’re tuned so that they’re <i>just </i>reactable enough to be defended against if you’re looking out for them, but also still fast enough to catch you by surprise if you’re not. All you have to do is Drive Impact them right back: you’ll absorb their attack, hit with yours, and now the roles have reversed so that you get the opportunity for a full combo. Countering Drive Impacts is just so incredibly satisfying, especially when it’s the key to you turning the tables and winning a tight round. Street Fighter 6’s roster of 18 characters is mostly familiar, with 12 returning characters and six being entirely new, but even the returning characters feel fresh thanks to new quirks added to their move sets. Ken’s command run, for example, now changes up the properties of several of his special moves when he uses them out of it, giving them EX-like properties without having to spend Drive Meter on them; Cammy can now charge her special moves and give them V-Trigger like qualities; and Dee Jay has a ton of new feints that make him an extremely tricky character to use and play against. The new blood, meanwhile, are some of the best additions Street Fighter has seen. Kimberly is a clear standout, with a ninja-inspired moveset that has her closing the distance with quick teleports, piledriving you into the ground with Izuna drop-like air throws, and mixing you up with tricky leaps from half a screen away. Jamie, meanwhile, is a drunken melee powerhouse who is able to buff himself by taking swigs of his flask, and once he takes four drinks pretty much all of his moves become extremely dangerous with multi-hitting attacks that left me totally clueless on when it was actually my turn to try and fight back until I labbed against him in training mode. Pretty much every Street Fighter character archetype has representation here. You’ve got your grapplers in Zangief and Manon; your rushdown fighters in Ken, Jamie, and Cammy; your zoners with Guile, Dhalsim, and JP; and your powerhouse bruisers in Marissa and Honda. It’s everything I want out of a roster. World Tour is an ambitious single-player mode, and while it is a big step up from Street Fighter 5’s attempt at a cinematic story mode (and anything else Street Fighter has done before) it’s certainly the weakest part of Street Fighter 6. It’s at least a great idea: It’s a surprisingly enormous RPG that allows you to take a created character into the world of Street Fighter, interacting with the playable roster by becoming their disciple and learning their moves, and then building them up from scratch by leveling up, equipping various types of stat-altering gear, and selecting powerful skills. It also does a good job of teaching new players the fundamentals of Street Fighter 6 by including lessons as sidequests, with steadily increasing difficulty over the course of about 20 hours. However, RPGs live and die by their stories, and the story of World Tour is unbelievably dull. With paper-thin characters, predictable plot twists, and a mute protagonist whose main purpose is just to be an errand boy for various gangs and factions, there’s nothing to get excited about. It feels like it was written with the primary purpose of having your character jump around to various countries to meet the roster characters, and yet it never really bothers to justify those trips. In one chapter, a random gangster all of sudden tells me that I need to get her bag back that my buddy stole. And so without any objection, the most reasonable solution is for me to make a global trip to Rome in order to fashion a counterfeit bag that I can hopefully use to fool the gangster into thinking I got her bag back. In another chapter I had to go to Jamaica and Brazil because my original mentor, Luke, wanted souvenirs from those places and doesn’t know how to shop online I guess? At least the tone is goofy and fun, which is a great fit for Street Fighter. You can fight just about anyone on the street, regardless of whether they deserve a Rising Uppercut to the face or not; it’s fun to use ridiculous-looking moves like the Spinning Bird Kick to cross gaps like you’re a human helicopter, and there’s a surprising amount of enemy variety, many of which do an admirable job of teaching newer players how to deal with specific situations that will come up outside of story mode. Some enemies will favor blocking high, making them vulnerable to low attacks; others will stay permanently in the air and must be brought down by anti-air techniques; and others still will try to hang back and pepper you with projectiles, forcing you to fight them like you would a zoner-type character. And then you can also fight refrigerators… And Roombas. It’s weird, but in a very amusing, Yakuza-esque kind of way. There’s also a variety of fun minigames that do a great job of “gamifying” techniques that you actually would use in a typical fight. In one of them you have to chop bottles by holding back for a second and then quickly moving the stick in the opposite direction and pressing a button, which is how you’d perform charge-type special moves on a character like Guile or Blanka; another has you making pizza by quickly performing special move inputs as they appear on screen; and another still has you using your combos to quickly destroy a big rig in a nod to the original car-busting minigame from Street Fighter 2. The best thing about World Tour, though, and the thing that really serves as the carrot at the end of the stick, is the promise of being able to outfit your character with moves from every other fighter. By the end of the campaign I could use Dhalsim’s teleport to instantly appear behind an opponent, hit them with Zangief’s Spinning Piledriver, and then use Ken’s Dragonlash Kick to get right back up in their face. Being able to customize my character in ways that would make them absolutely broken in the real game is a lot of fun. The issue is that it takes <i>forever</i> to level up a character’s style to the point where you learn new moves from them. You do this simply by using them, but even though I only used Luke’s and Ken’s throughout the entire mode, I still didn’t max out either of them. Those who love a good grind may enjoy having plenty left over to unlock after the 20 or so hours it takes to complete World Tour, but I would've liked the drip feed of new unlocks to be substantially faster considering the sheer amount of rewards there are to unlock by maxing out the ranks of each character. I have many more issues with World Tour, but even despite them, I still had a fun time with it in the end. It’s a mode that’s more directly aimed toward people without a lot of fighting game experience, and I think those people will get a ton more out of it than I did. The character customization elements are great, the way it incentivizes fundamental lessons of how to play Street Fighter 6 by dressing them up as side missions and minigames is extremely well done, and there’s just an overwhelming amount of content to discover with two very large open worlds to explore (both of which have day and nighttime versions that each have their own set of side-missions to discover). Another reason why you might want to go through World Tour mode is that you’re able to take your character and all the gear they’ve earned into the online Battle Hub, which is an online social space where you queue into both ranked and unranked matchmaking, or pull up on a cabinet much like you would in a local arcade and await challengers. Online lobbies are not a new thing in the world of fighting games, and truthfully, I’ve never been the biggest fan of them, but Street Fighter 6’s implementation of the Battle Hub has won me over. For one, it’s super cool to look at because Street Fighter 6’s character creator is absolutely wild, and gives you the freedom to make beautiful creations with finely tuned features or unspeakable monsters with out of this world bodily proportions, and it’s fun to just wander around the hub and see what people have come up with. There’s also a lot of things to do beyond just parking at a cabinet playing with either friends or random players. There’s a section of the hub where you can play a rotating selection of classic Capcom games like Final Fight and Street Fighter 2; another section where you can play Extreme Battles with party-like rule sets and gimmicks; a store where you can purchase more customizable clothes for your avatar with in-game currency; and you can even pit your created character against others in Avatar Battles. But <i>the most important thing</i> about Battle Hub is that it’s all optional. If you don’t want to deal with it, you don’t have to. You can simply queue up for ranked or casual matches via a menu, go into training mode while you wait, or create a custom room for multiple friends without ever having to go through the Battle Hub – which is exactly how it should be. What really pushes Street Fighter 6 over the edge is how it completely nails virtually everything outside of its main modes that you could ask for in a fighting game. Based on my experience playing pre-launch and in all three betas, including the open beta, its netcode is excellent; it’s got the best training mode I’ve ever seen in a fighting game, complete with frame data and cancel window data; it’s got extremely helpful character guides that make it very easy to learn a new character from scratch; combo trials that teach you practical combos for a variety of situations; load times are extremely quick and rematches are nearly instantaneous; you can search for replays with a ton of different filters to help you learn matchups; there’s crossplay across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC; you can create and join clubs; and so on. Many fighting games also have these features, but very few have all of them, and especially not right out of the gate. Street Fighter 6 also deserves credit for really making an effort to welcome newcomers in innovative ways. On top of the World Tour mode, there’s also a new Modern control scheme that allows you to play without having to worry about character-specific command inputs or combo routes. Special moves are mapped to a button and a direction, much like Smash Brothers – there’s one button each for light, medium, and heavy attacks, you can execute combos by holding down an assist button and mashing one of the three attack buttons, and you can use super moves just by pressing two buttons at the same time. The playing field is kept even by the fact that those using Modern Controls don’t have access to a character’s full repertoire of normal moves, but being able to perform special moves with just the press of a button is a tradeoff that makes the Modern Control style appealing even for those who aren’t beginners. And for those who just want to hold forward and mash on one button to execute special moves and combos, there’s a new Dynamic control scheme that’s only usable offline and essentially lets the AI choose the attacks for you. Capcom’s really covered all the bases here.  Street Fighter games are always benchmark moments for the 2D fighting game genre, but Street Fighter 6 feels extra special. The Drive System is an incredible addition to the fighting mechanics that gives you a veritable Swiss Army knife of options and meter-management decisions right from the start of every single round, the starting roster is the best Street Fighter has ever seen, its online netcode through three betas has been impeccable so far, and the number of smaller details that it nails right out of the gate is unprecedented. It’s so good that even the poor story and extremely slow progression of the single-player World Tour amounts to only a jab’s worth of damage on its metaphorical health bar. Whether you’re completely new to fighting games or are a seasoned vet, Street Fighter 6 is a must play. "
LEGO 2K Drive ,8,"LEGO 2K Drive may sound like it was named at 5:40 on a Friday afternoon – seriously, if blending the publisher’s name and a five-letter verb describing what you’ll be doing most is all it takes these days, I look forward to the next Call of Duty being christened Activision Shoot – but hey, don’t hold that against it. Highly charming and imaginative, 2K Drive fuses confident kart racing with a virtually unlimited custom garage, making it a place where you can spend just as much time fastidiously building vehicles as you do frantically racing them. LEGO 2K Drive cribs from a lot of existing racers, which makes it fairly easy to explain. Forza Horizon 4’s dearly-loved LEGO expansion rates as an automatic mention as a fellow open-world, LEGO-themed racer (and they certainly both share the idea of having races and challenges spread out across the map to organically discover as we explore). However, despite that obvious LEGO link, 2K Drive is arguably more in-line with Ubisoft’s The Crew 2 and its hot-swapping system. Vehicles in 2K Drive transform between street rides, offroad racers, and boats as the terrain changes, complete with a satisfying brick-clicking sound effect.  The ability to have multiple different trios of vehicles saved in your loadouts is very handy, though I would say the system is a little overzealous when set to shift automatically. The effect of your ride rapidly blinking from street to offroad and back again, after spending just a split-second on the shoulder, is a bit manic – but you can turn automatic switching off if you’d rather swap manually. If you’re unfamiliar with The Crew 2, Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed’s similarly mighty take on morphing motors may give you some idea of what to expect – their brands of multi-terrain, vehicle-swapping racing around regularly crazy courses while blasting opponents with weapons are very alike. 2K Drive definitely deviates from the Horizon brand of LEGO racing in terms of scale, too; it’s far more akin to Hot Wheels Unleashed in this regard. That is, there’s an effective feeling that bucketfuls of LEGO have been assembled within life-sized environments, with huge, non-LEGO items like tools, tyres, and tree roots scattered amongst colourful plastic dioramas in each of its four separate open worlds. Unfortunately, 2K Drive doesn’t nail this toy-sized idea quite as consistently as Hot Wheels Unleashed does. The lighting isn’t as convincing, and the illusion is occasionally disrupted by items that feel out-of-place at the scale it’s trying to suggest – like, say, miniature real leaf litter that should’ve been life-sized. Also, unlike Hot Wheels Unleashed, 2K Drive doesn’t measure distances in centimetres or inches, which is a slight shame because it’s those last pieces of attention to detail that would make a pint-sized toy racer like this really sing, if you catch my drift. On that note, drifting is executed in a slightly peculiar way in 2K Drive, and by default it requires us to hold both the brake and throttle at the same time throughout an entire drift. It’s actually very easy to grasp, but it does feel a little odd to have the brake squeezed fully down for considerable parts of a race. It’s possible to switch to a more typical tap-to-drift mechanic but that’s a little less predictable and I have found my drifts ending prematurely, leaving me to battle understeer or jam down the brake mid-corner to get another drift going. That said, the sensation of long, high-speed powerslides is well translated by 2K Drive’s handling model. It’s simple to pick up and play but arguably more complex than it first seems – especially once you start to exploit the mild air controls possible via the rocket jump and nitro boost, or feel the subtle effects of weight as your vehicles lose bricks from collisions and combat (in a clever touch, crashing through trackside objects will replenish the LEGO in your own damaged ride). Also, the dedicated handbrake button – or quick turn, as 2K Drive dubs it – is a crucial and welcome addition. It’s very useful for tight switchbacks and an absolute necessity to effectively complete some of the missions – particularly the destruction-based ones that require swift changes of direction. The rubber-banding might be a fraction too flagrant at times, but it does at least keep the racing chaotic and close, and it rarely feels unfair. The track design is also generally strong, with plenty of technical segments, environmental hazards, and rewarding shortcuts. 2K Drive performs smoothly on Xbox Series X, but I have had a friend lose hours of save game progress on PS5 without warning, which appears to be a known issue. 2K Drive is probably guilty of leaning a little too heavily on some of its non-racing mission types, some of which are riffed upon several times throughout the career mode. The collection missions are the most egregious and they’re essentially just padding to stretch out proceedings. The story itself lasted me around 10 hours sticking at it, but I have been left with a lot of uncompleted side objectives. It does a slightly poor job of spelling out why certain later missions are unavailable until you unlock the next batch of races, especially since younger players may just stumble across them and think they’re broken, but the story is very cute. I absolutely found myself smiling along with the cutscenes, which emulate the same photoreal stop-motion style nailed by The LEGO Movie. My kids loved the villain, who is frankly far funnier than the token bad guy in a licensed racing game probably had any right to be. Now, the last LEGO racing game I played – beyond Forza Horizon’s take on it – was LEGO Racers back in 1999, which is fondly remembered by gamers of a particular vintage for its rudimentary custom car building. 2K Drive pays homage to that game with a customisation tool of its own that would’ve seemed like witchcraft in the late ’90s. Seriously, if you can dream it – and it fits in the allocated space – you can build it. It’s honestly quite remarkable. In fact, my stats tell me I’ve spent more time building than I have driving. The amount of options and controls was a little intimidating at first but after a few hours I felt quite comfortable relaxing and piecing together my first project – which became a chunky caricature of Mad Max’s iconic Interceptor. Snapping pieces together is occasionally finicky, but generally it’s very cooperative. Pieces can be painted any colour you want, whether they’re officially available in the real world that way or not. You can group pieces, duplicate them, mirror them, and make fine angle adjustments. You can even delete and add pieces without pulling entire segments apart, like you’d have to do in real life. A range of pieces are held in reserve as rewards or available to purchase for credits from the in-game store – meaning you may not be able to perfect your build immediately upon booting up – but the customisation system in 2K Drive is nothing short of excellent. It’s not mandatory to spend a bunch of time here, though – if you don’t want to start from scratch, you can edit the existing models for a head start on builds. Don’t feel you have to put together large projects like mine, either. If you want to keep it simple, you can grab a palm-sized chassis and simply whack together a quick little kart with a handful of bricks. You’ll be back in 1999 in no time. Moreover, if a meathead like me is able to put something like this together after just several years of riding shotgun on my kids’ LEGO building, imagine what true LEGO experts are going to be able to assemble. Finding that out is where 2K Drive stumbles, though, as the ability to share creations is not available presently. It’s been clarified that custom vehicle sharing is a feature that will be included in a post-launch update, but what form that takes is a mystery. Will it be limited to friends? Or will there be an in-game browser to see the best models from anybody? I hope it’s the latter. What’s particularly unfortunate is that an in-game microtransation store has apparently taken precedence over players sharing user-generated content, especially considering the prices of the content in it seem very high relative to the payouts of in-game currency I’ve received on the way to reaching the end of the story. Most new cars appear to cost 10,000 credits, though some limited-time items can cost over twice that. It appears as a standard service game storefront, complete with the typical obfuscation of what you’re actually spending with a secondary currency. Personally, I’m not interested in engaging with it, and the only reason I’ve used it is to buy more brick types to make my own vehicles (which have thankfully been cheap enough to pick up with credits earned simply from playing). However, I don’t doubt there’ll be kids conned into hassling their parents for credits for new cars and minifigs. How will an ability to disseminate free custom user vehicles work in concert with this? I know people are going to build some amazing stuff, and I would like them to be able to share it.  One part The Crew 2, one part Mario Kart, and one thousand parts… LEGO parts, LEGO 2K Drive is a wild and whimsical all-ages kart racer that’s buried itself under my skin like the pointed edge of rogue plastic brick underfoot in a messy kid’s bedroom. Better still, it’s one that embraces the total creative freedom real LEGO affords like few games before it, with an incredible custom vehicle creation tool that’s just about worth the price of admission alone. The current inability to share those designs with others is disappointing – particularly in the shadow of another tedious microtransaction store – but LEGO 2K Drive is certainly the fastest and funniest way to rock out with your blocks out in recent memory.

The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom ,10,"Ask yourself this: what do you want from a sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild? More enemy variety? Better dungeons? Totally unexpected new ideas? Or is simply more Hyrule to explore enough for you? Thankfully, you don’t have to pick just one, because Nintendo’s response to all of those answers is a casual but confident, “Sure thing.” The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom doesn’t necessarily revolutionize what already made Breath of the Wild one of the greatest games of all time, but it’s not a sequel that’s simply more of the same, either. This sandbox is bigger, richer, and somehow even more ambitious, with creative new systems like vehicle building, ridiculous weapon crafting, and a revamped map with a dizzying amount of depth further fleshing out the intoxicating exploration that made the original so captivating. Breath of the Wild felt far from unfinished but, inconceivably, Tears of the Kingdom has somehow made it feel like a first draft. Before we dive too deep into Hyrule, <strong>a quick note about spoilers</strong>. I won’t spoil the (actually pretty great) story Tears tells, but these games are about so much more than the plot. That magic the first time you see one of BotW’s dragons soaring overhead is around every corner here too, and the last thing I’d want to do is steal the <i>many </i>moments that made my jaw literally drop from you. That said, there are some <i>huge</i> parts of Tears that are introduced fairly early on that I will be talking about because of how fundamental they are to why this game is so impressive. I am going to preserve as much of the magic as I can but, if (like millions of others) you’ve already decided you are going to play Tears, you should probably just go play it and then come back to share in the wonder with me later.  The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a masterclass in open-world design and a watershed game that reinvents a 30-year-old franchise. It presents a wonderful sandbox full of mystery, dangling dozens upon dozens of tantalizing things in front of you that just beg to be explored. I’ve had so many adventures in Breath of the Wild, and each one has a unique story behind what led me to them, making them stories on top of stories. And even after I’ve spent more than 50 hours searching the far reaches of Hyrule, I still manage to come across things I haven’t seen before. I’ll easily spend 50 to 100 more trying to track down its fascinating moments. - <i>Jose Otero, March 2, 2017</i Read the full <a href=""/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/1214/review/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild review</a>. On top of that, you’ll likely want to have played BotW to fully understand much of what I’ll be discussing here – not to mention because it’s an incredible game and you’re depriving yourself by skipping it. Tears looks even smarter and more expansive when you know what came before it, but many of the recognizable basics shine just as brightly. Things that are as simple as being able to climb nearly any wall or glide as far as your expandible stamina will take you, or the concept of shrines acting as self-contained puzzle chambers you can solve to boost your abilities are things I don’t have time to get into here simply because there’s so much new to cover. I <i>can </i>safely say people who enjoyed BotW will almost certainly like Tears, partly because of just how similar these two games are. The initial structure is a very familiar one: you start in a masterfully crafted introductory area where you learn the ropes and get a new set of powerful abilities, then dive into the open world with a main quest marker that quickly splits into four. From there you are free to do whatever the heck you want. You can even march right to the finale of the campaign if you know where to look, though that’s not quite as straightforward to attempt this time around (which is probably for the best, as I do not recommend it for anybody but the inevitable speedrunners, whom I proudly salute). The bulk of the cutscenes and big story moments are also once again collected at specific spots around the map, shedding light on the history of Hyrule and the source of the “Upheaval” – a bombastic event at the start of Tears that opens up menacing chasms, causes the ruins of an ancient civilization called the Zonai to appear floating in the sky, and peppers the surface with new structures and strange anomalies. This still might not be the <i>best </i>storytelling structure over the course of such a large game, as it leaves you without much direct interaction with its central characters for most of your time playing, but that’s very easy to forgive when the story itself is so dang cool. Sure, it’s about stopping some evil jerk (welcome back, Ganondorf) and saving Princess Zelda as usual, but the direction that familiar shell is taken is <i>buck wild</i> at times in the best possible way. I’m still a bit amazed Nintendo decided to go the way it did, and the freshness that surprise provides helps Tears stand out amongst your typical Zelda plots. It’s not storytelling on the level of a game like <a href=""/god-of-war-ps4/13029/review/god-of-war-review""><u>God of War</u></a> or anything, but it can be a legitimate high point instead of simply the entertaining background flavor it was mostly relegated to in BotW. Exploration is the lifeblood of the recent Zeldas, though, and doing so is still an absolute delight in Tears – especially when the new building system empowers you to slap together custom cars, boats, and flying machines that truly let you navigate its world however you want. BotW has influenced countless other games since its release in 2017, but one of the most important lessons that very few of them seemed to learn is that a blank map can be more powerful than a full one. There is an enormous amount of stuff to do and see, and if you were handed a checklist of waypoints to methodically clear off right away it could easily feel overwhelming rather than exciting. Instead, you are given the bare minimum you need to complete the main quest, a pile of pins, and a blank map just begging you to fill it in yourself. Marking down points of interest as you dive in from the sky, hearing rumors as you talk to townsfolk, or simply getting lost and stumbling by something interesting is so much more rewarding than following an arrow to your next destination. It comes from experience, but Nintendo has incredible confidence that we will seek out the map’s secrets without being led directly to them – and if we don’t see absolutely everything, that’s okay. It makes the whole adventure feel so natural, so much less “video gamey” than you might expect, which is particularly important when Tears basically doubles the size of this world. While this is the same fundamental map of Hyrule, it in no way feels repetitive to explore – even as someone who’s scoured BotW for secrets. The story doesn’t give you a hard number, but it’s been a few years since the defeat of Calamity Ganon, and the people are rebuilding. The main town is a brand-new outpost that has sprung up in Hyrule Field just outside of the castle, giving you a hub that evolves in entertaining ways as you progress. It’s a ton of fun to recognize characters or locations and see how they’ve grown or changed, but even beyond those explicit differences, Tears simply sends you along unexpected paths and to unfamiliar locations. That made me constantly see parts of Hyrule I knew and loved from a different perspective, breathing plenty of life into a map that clearly still had more than enough to give. And if that’s not enough for you, there are also more <i>substantial </i>changes. I’ll leave many of the fine details for you to find on your own, but I will say that whole areas have been drastically altered by the Upheaval, causing unexpected weather anomalies or creating brand-new terrain for chests and shrines alike to hide in. The main quest has you marching toward many of those areas head-on, but there are also plenty of examples off the beaten path that I’ve discovered across the more than 100 hours of playing (and I’m sure there are many more I’ve missed). For example, the beach town of Lurelin in the southeast didn’t play a huge role in BotW, but almost immediately Tears tells you it’s been attacked by pirates, putting both its rescue and its rebuilding in your hands. And if <i>that’s</i> not enough for you, there are also dozens and dozens of caves, wells, and sky islands to explore. These are all largely self-contained little encounters to complete, ranging from hidden fairy fountains to expansive obstacle courses that put your cleverness and combat prowess to the test. I loved stumbling upon a new cave and fighting my way through winding halls full of monsters to find some hidden piece of armor at the end – or sometimes even a larger boss monster guarding a shrine. Meanwhile, looking up instead of down, using one of the new Skyview Towers to launch myself into the air let me easily find shrines on the surface before gliding to a nearby floating archipelago filled with its own challenges to take on. i>And if that’s still not enough for you</i>, then boy oh boy did I save the biggest for last – and let this also serve as a <strong>final warning</strong> that if you want to know nothing beyond what’s been shown in trailers and previews, turn back now (granted, this part is revealed to you very shortly after the introductory area). Even with all of what I’ve talked about so far, I can understand if someone might think Nintendo took a safe route by reusing the same (if altered) map, but it was when I dove down one of the angry, red chasms that dot the surface and into the Depths below that all my doubts melted into pure, joyous amazement. Rest assured that the generally small sky islands do not represent the entirety of the new area to explore, because waiting beneath is a dangerous, pitch-black map that is <i>literally the size of Hyrule itself</i>. It is massive. I have played over 100 hours of Tears and I have revealed maybe half of this wondrous new area. While roughly the same size as the surface, the Depths doesn’t have as much in the way of side quests or story moments but is full of treasure chests to seek out and plenty of surprises worth discovering for yourself, many of which are brilliantly hidden in plain (if very dark) sight. It acts as Zelda’s version of a “poison swamp”-style nightmarescape, too, thanks to a red substance called Gloom that coats both its terrain and enemies. When you take damage from Gloom, your <i>max </i>health is decreased until you either return to the light or eat a Gloom-removing meal, adding an enjoyable mounting pressure to every fight. What do I mean by “return to the light?” That’s a whole different can of worms. The Depths is completely dark (like, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjA98SWhuFQ"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>Advanced Darkness</u></a> dark), meaning you have to throw out collectable Brightbloom Seeds as you walk to see where you are going, which gives exploration a totally different and much tenser feel. There are no shrines in the Depths; instead, there are dozens of structures called Lightroots that heal your Gloom damage and illuminate a part of the map around them when activated, giving you another completionist goal that’s equal parts compelling and extensive. Taken all together, the Depths and the sky islands act as brilliant complements to the more traditional surface activities, stretching a structure I was already intimately familiar with into beautiful settings and wild situations I very much wasn’t. Whether it’s lighting up the darkness below, flying a custom glider between floating rocks hundreds of meters up, or just seeing what’s down at the bottom of some random well, there is <i>so much to do</i> in Tears that it’s easy to spend hours upon hours completing tasks without ever once looking at your quest log. You might be heading to a point of interest only to get sidetracked by some cave worth exploring nearby or a citizen with a quest for you, and suddenly you’re off getting hopelessly distracted by a delightfully spontaneous activity that’s just as exciting. That was part of the magic of BotW too – as well as plenty of other great open-world games – but now there are uncountable opportunities to end up wildly far away from where you thought (almost always incorrectly) you were going. One time I was making my way toward a tower hoping to chart a new section of the map when I stumbled upon a friendly drummer in need of some honey, so I promptly switched priorities and headed toward a nearby forest in search of bees... and of course, it wasn’t very long after that I was in the literal underworld being murdered by a giant robot as a result. I just wanted some honey. Nintendo had different plans for me, and I couldn’t be happier about that. In 2017, I had played just over 80 hours of BotW when I finally decided to beat the final boss, feeling content that I had done all of the side quests, shrine hunting, and other odds and ends that I wanted to do. Not quite all that existed, mind you, but definitely a significant majority and certainly all of what really tempted me. Similarly, I beat Tears’ main questline around the 82-hour mark, but this time I feel like I have barely done half of all the things I still want to. Even more than 20 hours after that, I still have dozens of Lightroots to find, plenty of shrines left to complete, two maps marked up with loads of unexplored points of interest, a laundry list of side quests waiting for me, and so much more. I took my time playing through the main quest stuff, too, letting myself wander and get distracted as I so love to do. It’s hard to overstate how big this game feels, even in the context of a predecessor that made me say that exact same thing. The in-game tracker tells me I’ve barely passed 50%. Send help. So much of Tears feels like a direct response to BotW and what people have said about it since its release, a fact that can be seen clearly across its bolstered enemies and weapons, but perhaps most obviously in its dungeon design. The Divine Beasts got a lot of flack for bucking usual Zelda dungeon trends, and while their equivalent in Tears doesn’t scratch that itch of collecting a compass, map, and key item like in older Zelda games either, they are at least a lot more thematically interesting and varied this time around. The tasks themselves aren’t actually very different from the Divine Beasts, but their flavorful new context and the epic paths that generally lead up to them are a thrill, making them all far more entertaining than the rather restrictive insides of those ancient machines. The other huge improvement throughout all of Tears is the boss variety. No longer are you fighting four variations of the same Ganon-adjacent enemy; you’re now facing unique and often wildly entertaining foes that can occasionally stand with the greats of the series. I don’t want to give away too much about them, but a standout for me was certainly a gooped-up monster that felt like a Splatoon villain had somehow infiltrated Hyrule. New boss-like enemies abound all across this map, in fact, with the returning Hinox and Talus joined by leaping Frox and fearsome three-headed Gleeok. It’s not just the bosses – enemy variety as a whole has been vastly improved, and it’s elevated the still rather straightforward but extremely satisfying combat as a result. At the simplest level, Bokoblins can now carry baskets of throwable items or wear armor you have to break specifically with blunt weapons, but they can also be led by a huge Boss Bokoblin that coordinates their attacks. New Horriblins menacingly crawl along cave ceilings, Constructs can shoot rocket arrows at you, Like Likes will devour you whole, and Little Frox will scurry out to eat the Brightblooms you’ve worked so hard to collect and plant in the Depths. It’s a wide and impressive menagerie that can genuinely push you to play differently depending on what’s in front of you. That’s also true of the absolutely absurd new weapon fusion system, which lets you attach <i>any</i> item or object onto any other weapon, shield, and often even arrowhead. Monster horns now act as powerful blades or bludgeons to buff your base weapons, letting you do sweet things like replace the blade of a rusty sword with the katana-like saber of a Blue Lizalfos horn. You can also do extremely dumb stuff, like put a bomb on the end of a stick to blow both you and your enemies up the moment you jab them with it, or put a minecart on a spear because… I don’t know, why not? It’s a system that just says, “Yes” to whatever you throw at it, and then trusts you to figure out what’s good, bad, or incredibly funny. Even though the somewhat controversial weapon durability system is back, so you should prepare for the heartbreak of your favorite sword shattering in your hands all over again, it’s been totally recontextualized by this new fusion system. Suddenly, you can essentially farm strong weapons simply by killing powerful enemies, because having a bag full of monster parts is the equivalent of having dozens of backup weapons just waiting for a handle to be attached to. You won’t find fire swords just lying around anymore – you have to <i>make</i> them, and any base sword will do fine if you’ve got the horn of a fire dragon to slap onto it. There’s loads of room to min-max and build high-damage weapons that are tailor-made to take down the hardest enemies Tears can throw at you here, but so much of the power and playstyle of a weapon coming from the attachment instead of the base meant I was always excited to hunt down more powerful parts rather than hoard what I managed to find. (Or I would just stick a stick on a stick so I could poke an enemy from twice as far away, whatever sticks for you!) Tears adds additional nuance to combat by giving you even more options to explore, too. Throwing items are now a key part of every encounter, letting you hurl everything from bombs (which are now an explosively powerful consumable item rather than a weaker but infinitely reusable ability) to special plants – like the <i>excellent</i> Muddle Bud that makes enemies attack each other, or the Dazzlefruit that causes them to drop their weapons. These items can be attached to arrowheads for the same effect from afar, and shields can even have objects like flame or ice throwers slapped onto them to transform them from a defensive option to an offhand weapon. The controls for throwing and attaching arrowheads started out a little tricky, since you have to select the items you want to use one at a time, but once I got the hang of it I found it to be a super-intuitive system that let me pull off cool mid-fight maneuvers I would never be able to do in BotW. The complementary ability to weapon fusion is the boundlessly creative Ultra Hand building system. Essentially, BotW’s Magnesis power got a huge upgrade that now lets you pick up, rotate, and attach almost any object to another with ease. This is supported by dozens of special objects, called Zonai Devices, that you can pull out of your inventory at any time, giving you immense freedom in how you navigate the world around you. It’s amazing how often I would take a Zonai glider and a few fans out of my pocket to build a makeshift airplane and fly somewhere extremely far away extremely fast, and I loved experimenting with powered wheels to make cars that could take me from town to town faster than any horse. Your creations can even be effective in combat, with one Zonai device acting as a Roomba-like base that automatically drives toward enemies, waiting to be loaded up with whatever instruments of doom you can concoct. These building tools walk the line of powerful but approachable extremely well, being fairly snappy and easy to use while allowing for a level of customization it’s hard to find the limits of. Why climb that cliff when you can just strap a hot air balloon to a log and ride it up? Why swim across that river when you could quickly assemble a speedboat instead? One time I was driving a little car I’d built, only to reach a dead-end mountain next to a deep valley – but instead of abandoning my creation to climb over, I channeled my inner Doc Brown and turned it into a flying car that was able to hover around the mountain instead. Did Nintendo mean for me to go that way? I have no idea. I didn’t earn anything for it, but that simple act might still be one of the most rewarding gaming moments I’ve had in a long time. “I’m not sure I was supposed to do that, but it worked” sort of feels like the unofficial slogan of BotW to me, and Tears leans even harder into that creativity. These building tools are woven into every part of Tears, with most of its shrine challenges asking you to make use of them in inventive or inspiring ways. However, this isn’t <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/11/05/banjo-kazooie-nuts-bolts-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>The Legend of Zelda: Nuts &amp; Bolts</u></a>. That is to say, this system doesn’t warp Tears into something unrecognizably <i>about</i> building. In almost every scenario where a contraption would be the best or “intended” way to do something, you’ll find the pieces for a simple creation sitting nearby. There’s also an Autobuild ability that lets you save designs and hunt down schematics for developer-designed creations. That means Tears provides shortcuts if you aren’t really interested in this side of it while simultaneously empowering those of us who <i>are </i>to essentially play Kerbal Space Program within The Legend of Zelda. I had tons of fun using these tools to find solutions to the problems put in front of me. A highlight is a recurring character who needs help holding up a sign at dozens of different locations around Hyrule, asking you to use nearby resources to prop it up in progressively more ridiculous situations. Getting from point A to point B can become an engaging puzzle all its own, whether that’s building a contraption to help get a Korok (yes, this world is once again full of them) to his far-off friend, or making a traveling band’s carriage fly to get them up a mountain side. Amidst all this cleverness there’s also a hysterical air of Looney Tunes lunacy, letting you strap literal rockets to anything and everything and then watch like Wile E. Coyote as your plans disastrously blow up in your face or simply drive off out of control. Sometimes failure is just as amusing as success. Your other two new abilities take a less prominent role, but they support the additions made elsewhere nicely. You can reverse time on objects with Recall, which is largely used either to ride rocks that have fallen from sky islands back up where they came from or to send an enemy attacks back at them in neat ways, while Ascend lets you warp through the ceiling up to whatever is above you. Given all of the caves in Tears, the ability to quickly get above ground again or climb certain mountains faster is essential, and it can even be used to find all manner of sneaky secrets. It took my brain some time to remember I even had this power, but once I started “thinking with portals” it became one of my favorite tools. Neither of these abilities are quite as exciting as Ultra Hand or Fuse, necessarily, but it’s notable that I never once mourned the loss of Stasis or Cryonis, which are completely gone since Link no longer has the Sheikah Slate from BotW. There are also a million and a half little quality-of-life improvements that make it even harder to go back to BotW after Tears. That includes super-simple things like the fact that you are now given the option to drop a weapon, shield, or bow right away when you open a chest with a full inventory rather than having to back out first, open the menu, drop the thing, and open the chest again. But there are also more involved changes, like finally having a convenient recipe list that saves every meal and elixir you’ve ever made or found, which I actually <a href=""/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/65660/opinion/forget-weapon-durability-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-needs-a-cooking-overhaul""><u>specifically said</u></a> would be a great addition just a couple of weeks ago. I couldn’t even begin to round up all the little bits and bobs like this, and it signals loudly that Nintendo was listening to feedback, even if it didn’t always make drastic changes in response. i></i><a href=""https://www.ign.com/faceoffs/the-legend-of-zelda-face-off-which-game-is-the-best"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><i>(Click here to vote in our Legend of Zelda Face-Off!)</i></a One place Tears hasn’t necessarily improved over BotW, however, is performance. This can be a beautiful game, especially when flying high above its gorgeous landscapes with a consistently incredible soundtrack in the background, but the reality is that even when running in docked mode it’s still at 1080p resolution and 30 frames per second, at best. Obviously, that does not technically compare to what games on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or PC can do. However, unless you value resolution and frame rate above absolutely everything, including gameplay, that’s not really the point. The majority of the time Tears runs just fine, but the frame rate will take noticeable dives any time there are too many effects on screen at once. It didn’t feel any worse than the same exact issues in BotW, though it is a little more noticeable in the simple but charming new raids you can do against enemy camps with a group of NPC monster hunters. I also infrequently noticed things could briefly freeze while diving down quickly from the sky (the same sort of freeze BotW speedrunners see when <i>zipping</i> across Hyrule a little too fast). But on the whole, just as before, these issues rarely interrupt the action in a truly detrimental way. The frame rate dips can certainly be distracting at times, but the only harm they really cause is the emotional damage of making me once again pine for a Switch Pro, as we’ve all been doing for the past several years. Would it look nicer on a more powerful, more modern system? Definitely, and I hope Nintendo makes one before too long. But does that mean I am going to touch my PS5 or Xbox again until I’ve finished exploring this new version of Hyrule? Not a chance. It’s also really quite remarkable that I saw essentially no bugs across more than 100 hours of game time, positioning it far away from a mess like last year’s <a href=""/pokemon-scarlet/61745/review/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review-in-progress""><u>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</u></a> or plenty of other recent games on other platforms. Frankly, the fact that you can jump from the very top of the sky and dive all the way to the surface, straight through a chasm, and down to the floor of the Depths seamlessly, with zero load screens, on a Switch made in 2017 feels like a miracle, and that makes overlooking the handful of moments I saw it hang for a second or two while doing so incredibly easy. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is an unfathomable follow-up to one of the greatest games ever made, somehow improving upon it in nearly every way – be that with simple quality-of-life improvements, a genuinely exciting story, or wildly creative new building mechanics that make you rethink what is possible. It both revamps old ground and introduces vast new areas so immense it somehow makes me wonder if Breath of the Wild was actually all that big, with an almost alarming number of tasks to complete, mysteries to discover, and delightful distractions to keep you from ever reaching that place you naively thought you were headed. Nintendo has followed up a triumph with a triumph, expanding and evolving a world that already felt full beyond expectation and raising the bar ever higher into the clouds. "
Honkai: Star Rail ,9,"Honkai: Star Rail starts with a bang, serenading you with a symphony and blowing up a space station. You quickly ground yourself in a world with code-locked chrome doors, mech-like invaders with bladed arms, and rooms with monitors spread across the walls. Its hook of a prologue gives just enough that you can see why the story and gameplay are worth sticking around for without grinding. Charming characters, engaging combat, and carefully crafted worlds blend together into a game with enough content to keep you entertained for well over 50 hours, using polished versions of the progression systems from Honkai Impact 3rd and Genshin Impact to create HoYoverse’s best RPG yet.   HoYo has a reputation for crafting gacha games with a strong emphasis on story, and Honkai: Star Rail lives up to it. You play as the Trailblazer, an amnesiac protagonist who travels planet to planet on a train-like spaceship-like train called the Astral Express. It becomes a story surrounding the train’s crew, their backstories, and the different planets they visit. The story has its own twists and turns with some questionable pacing, but eventually it leads to an entertaining outcome that kept me wanting more. Major story arcs dip into the city of Belobog’s political conflict and its poverty-stricken Underworld. It also balances darker themes like loss with lighthearted jokes, some of which reference pop culture or RPG cliches. Weaving these threads together puts the spotlight on other characters and makes the overall story more cohesive as a whole. These arcs kept me up at night, grinding through levels just so I could get to the next quest.  Of course, the story is far from finished. HoYo still plans to add more in future updates like it has and still does with Genshin Impact, but Honkai: Star Rail already succeeds at slowly revealing small details about each character and creating situations that bring out the different facets of their personalities. It welcomes you with an intriguing mystery at the very beginning, and that sense of intrigue continues far into the campaign. You can’t play certain story quests or unlock certain abilities until you reach a high enough level, so you need to grind through battles and missions for experience. However, I appreciated that level-locked content as an excuse to explore the world outside of the major story quests and build characters before fighting higher-level enemies. Honkai: Star Rail is a free-to-play gacha game, which means it will be easier for some players than others because of the characters and gear they are lucky enough to get. However, it’s also set up in a way that’s fair even if you’re not paying. It gives you plenty of resources to get started, including at least 80 free pulls from the banners (which grant you characters and gear) and permanent rewards from side content. You’re also guaranteed to get at least one 5-star character (one of the strongest available teammates) from the standard banner about 50 pulls in. It already offers seven characters for free, so you have plenty of options to juggle. You don’t need luck (or money) to enjoy Honkai: Star Rail, even if your experience with it will differ. The Express Supply Pass is a favorite because it’s only $5 and offers you 300 Oneiric Shards right away, and that can speed up your progression. You need to log in 30 days in a row to get the full 2,700, however. Each Star Rail Pass costs 160 Stellar Jade, so that’s at least 16 Star Rail Passes total.  The Nameless Glory Battle Pass ($9.99) offers more valuable materials like Special Star Rail Passes and a free four-star Light Cone when you reach tier 30. All of these Light Cones are viable in the current meta, so buying the Battle Pass is a guaranteed way to get at least one competitive item.  You can also buy Oneiric Shards separately in bundles that range from 60 for 99 cents to 6,680 for $99.99. These are especially useful if you want a specific character and need Star Rail Passes to get them. I don’t suggest buying them to pull for characters, though, because it’s a slippery slope. You might not stop at one character. Why not another? Then you realize you’ve spent like $50 on a free-to-play game. Honkai: Star Rail has three major worlds so far, each of which has a wealth of details hidden in every nook and cranny. You trigger many interactions and learn new information from just investigating random objects and talking to your travel buddies and NPCs. Just interacting with every trash can in the city of Belobog can raise a reaction from your confused companions. Even Pom-Pom, the Astral Express conductor, seems like he has something new to tell you whenever you visit the Express. On top of that, each Light Cone (weapon-like cards that you attach to your characters to raise their stats and grant them special abilities) has a snippet of lore attached to it, sometimes related to memories of playable characters. There are also tons of in-game books and documents that I might never read, but are there in case anyone wants to take an even deeper dive into the lore. That’d all be for naught without the rewarding progression, though. Honkai: Star Rail leads you step by step through the layers of increasingly complicated systems as you level up, which helps prevent beginners from being overwhelmed with too much information at once. There are separate leveling systems for your account, characters, abilities, world (difficulty level), and two types of equipment – not to mention the various drops you use to level everything up. All these leveling items come from different places, so it can be a lot to remember at the beginning when you’re just learning how to play. At first, only golden Calyxes (challenges you complete for resources) offer materials for leveling up characters and equipment. However, the list of materials you need to improve characters expands as their levels climb. At level 20, your character only needs ascension books (the standard XP-raising materials) to ascend to the next level; at level 40, they need specific materials related to their elemental type or role. These materials come from crimson Calyxes and Stagnant Shadows, two other types of challenges, unlock after you hit a high enough level.  You then need to decide how to spend your Trailblaze Power, the main consumable resource you need to claim rewards from these challenges. Do you want to level up your characters’ abilities first? Or do you want to level up their Light Cone? At some point, it’s impossible to do all of them in one day without replenishing your Trailblaze Power with consumable items. Those come at a pace that feels fast enough when playing for free, but this is where HoYo encourages impatient people with cash on hand to pay to speed up their progress. Honkai: Star Rail features a turn-based combat system that gives you plenty to consider in terms of strategy, making it all the more satisfying when you pull off a victory. Thanks to the fact that each character is a combination of two types – a class (called a path) like damage dealer or support, and an elemental affinity similar to Pokémon – there’s enough variety that I never got tired of experimenting with team composition. Some teams may have an ace defender instead of a healer, or someone that debuffs enemies instead of buffing their own team members. For instance, if I buff my strongest character with a support ability, they can one-hit KO enemies and gain another turn; I also gave my favorite shielder equipment that raises their defense stat and gives them a higher chance of burning enemies. You also have a chance to switch teammates around depending on the weaknesses of the upcoming enemies, so planning ahead can be just as important as what you do when the fight begins.  Unfortunately, Honkai: Star Rail keeps the infuriating artifact system from Genshin Impact in the form of its Relics, which are gear that you equip on characters to boost their stats. There are too many layers that rely on chance, though, because which stat increases when you level up is randomized. Even if you have a Relic with at least three desirable substats, it’s still possible that the system will funnel every boost into the worst one. For example, one Relic could have critical damage, critical rate, attack, and a flat defense (not defense percentage, which is different) as its four substats. It seems like an ideal Relic for a damage-dealing character because of the critical and attack stats, but could become completely useless if your luck decides to level up flat defense every time. To its credit, HoYoverse has implemented a custom Relic system that allows you to craft your own Relics with enough of the related consumable item. That said, you still have to waste time stressing over Relics until you’ve played for hours and found enough junk to exchange for an ideal piece of gear. Of course, you should still be able to triumph in battle without the best Relics, even if it’ll be more difficult. Honkai: Star Rail rewards those who put in the effort but goes easy on those who don’t want to.  That said, this isn’t the kind of game for someone who just wants to run on cruise control. You have to be willing to put in the effort to learn the different systems, enough to build a strategy and manage your resources as efficiently as you can while enjoying the story and characters. Beginners might get away with throwing on whatever gear they find without leveling them up or considering the stats, but it becomes more difficult after a certain point without proper investment. If you’re not paying attention battles can drag on for many reasons, including poor team synergy, underleveled characters and equipment, or type disadvantages. I have many memories of grueling boss battles, including one where I needed to constantly shield and heal to survive because I was underleveled but impatient. Eventually, my team failed: my main damage-dealer barely dented the armor bar, even though they had a type advantage, and my healer wasn’t enough to keep the team afloat against the boss’ multi-target charge attack.  Even when you lose in Honkai: Star Rail, it feels like it genuinely encourages you to do better without punishing you. It gave me helpful tips that pushed me to reconsider the abilities I was using, like if I had enough attack on my main character and where I could get more resources to level up my gear. And of course, I had to stop to level up my Light Cones so I wasn’t quite so outmatched before I went up against that boss again. The fact that Honkai: Star Rail even suggests courses of action and how to look at your stats is a smart addition that will help less experienced players learn the ropes. That’s just some of the tons of text you’ll have to read in Honkai: Star Rail. Some scenarios are voice-acted, which added to the drama and my investment. Long explanations from NPCs can feel entertaining thanks to lively voice performances, but in many cases you should prepare for lots of text. The wordy dialogues make sense in the main missions because the little details add up to give you a bigger picture of what’s happening in the plot. The best missions involve characters I felt attached to, and even the ones without flashy cutscenes made my heart race.  Many missions outside of the main story also flesh out the worlds that you visit with entertaining and sometimes heartbreaking scenarios. You do get to make some decisions that have enough weight to potentially ruin some NPCs’ lives, but they don’t drastically change the outcome of the plot. That’s understandable considering this is an ongoing story and the developers can only create so many branching paths. Should you send a known scammer to jail, even if he makes people happy with his lies? Should you pull the plug on a well-meaning robot to stop a possible rampage, even if it would essentially remove their emotional intelligence and individuality? You can bully your clumsy crewmate or wag your finger at a mean old man. It’s your choice, and it kept me invested in the characters’ reactions to me and the outcome of my decisions. However, some side quests have a lot of information without as much investment. It starts to feel like a chore rather than an accomplishment to wrap up lingering side quests. Perhaps if there were more hidden character lore in them like in the character-focused Companion Missions, they would be more enticing than just gaining points at the end.  It’s so much more than that, anyway. I can go on about all the little quality-of-life details that Honkai: Star Rail includes that veterans of other HoYo games will appreciate, like how its descriptions highlight in-game jargon like “Break Effect” that might need explaining, and offer a definition when you click on it. It also has a Recommended Gear button that you can use to automatically choose Relics for each character if you don’t want to spend time crunching numbers. And each enemy has icons indicating their weaknesses before you even approach them, in case you forget. They even have at least two weaknesses so that you don’t feel like you’re disadvantaged because of just one missing element, which makes it much more forgiving if you haven’t covered every single element in your party. Honkai: Star Rail is the best free-to-play game of the year so far. Its stellar storytelling and satisfying progression systems offer dozens of hours of content that a HoYo newcomer can enjoy, even without paying for gacha items or having played Honkai Impact 3rd or Genshin Impact. Combat boasts layers of strategy for those willing to dig into details without barring more casual players from enjoying it. Its worldbuilding also expands outside of the main story into the side missions and interactable objects, making an already captivating world even more lively. It surpasses even Genshin in my mind, and I can see myself playing even months from now. "
dfall Review in Progress,4,"With Redfall arriving at IGN just a couple of days ahead of its official release date we haven’t had enough time to complete a final review yet – certainly not without becoming a nocturnal monster myself and staying awake all weekend. However, after several sessions – solo, co-op with a friend, and also in a group of three – I must admit I’m thoroughly underwhelmed by Redfall’s vanilla missions and lifeless world, and very disappointed at its lengthy list of display issues and bugs. Redfall is a distinct departure from the likes of Deathloop and Dishonored. Certainly some of that Arkane DNA has sidestepped its way into the finished product – chiefly in the magical abilities of the four available powered-up protagonists – but Redfall’s open-world approach to a modern day Massachusetts is otherwise a little more mundane in comparison. Not only does the architecture of Redfall seem a little flavourless compared to Deathloop’s funky retro-futurism and the Victorian backdrop of Dishonored, but there seems little to absorb whenever I stop to explore.  Perhaps best described as Far Cry with a supernatural slant, Redfall’s premise seems simple: take back the town from the slobbering vampires and their human flunkies that have occupied it. Unfortunately, so far the experience seems surprisingly boring and regularly broken. I appear to be just over halfway through and the mission design seems largely baked around poking through various locations around town looking for random items and picking them up, putting them down, or turning them on or off. Sometimes there’s a locked door involved, but a key for it will be sitting somewhere nearby – waiting to be arbitrarily stumbled across. It’s simply not interesting; it’s just a lot of walking around rooms looking at dull props until one of us accidentally highlights the one we need. Even the kooky and otherworldly vampire nests, which essentially function as enemy camps you can assault for loot, seem to be a letdown. These nightmarish nests, which remix parts of the overworld and warp and cram them into twisted tunnels descending to a huge and haunted heart that needs to be destroyed, quickly became chore-like – especially once I began to notice the same segments being recycled and reused in subsequent nests. strong>Fangs for Coming</strong With four heroes to choose from, each with three special abilities – plus co-op support for up to four players – there are objectively many ways you and a team of friends can approach combat in Redfall. At its best you’ll have players strategically teleporting around, conjuring up a ghostly sniper rifle, or summoning a friendly vampire ex-boyfriend to fight alongside you – like a David Boreanaz booty call. It’s kinetic and it’s bloody, and there <i>are</i> moments where it does come together in battles that would have Blade dipping his sunglasses in disbelief. Unfortunately, such moments are irregular at best, and I think it’s probably due to Redfall’s enemies lacking the wits to put up a stimulating fight. Human enemies seem largely disinterested with taking cover in a firefight, and I’ve had snipers rushing at me like Medieval knights. The vampires, however, are easily the worst offenders, charging and slashing at us like mindless animals. Worse, they just seem woefully underutilised as scary threats. A lot of the time they just float around in the open – apparently sleeping peacefully. They just hover, waiting for us to walk directly up to them and attack them – sometimes blissfully unaware you’ve just turned the vampire that was beside them to dust. It’d be easier to look past the plain combat had the rest of Redfall been able to get its fangs into me, but it still hasn’t and I’m sceptical it will. The story itself seems to be unfolding in lightly animated paintings or static, in-engine dioramas. They all look like placeholders for cutscenes that aren’t coming, and I have to say fighting my way to a film projector to run what’s essentially a slideshow certainly gives Redfall a cheapness that’s hard to shake. Redfall doesn’t save progression for any player but the host in co-op games, which seems fair enough if you and your mates don’t have the same missions unlocked but makes a lot less sense if all players are at identical points in the game. I began Redfall from scratch with two friends, all three of us fresh from the first mission, but while they kept their gear and XP they’ll now need to play those missions again. A lot has been made of Redfall only running at 30fps at launch on Xbox Series X|S but, while it’s certainly noticeable when moving rapidly, it’d be disingenuous of me to pretend it’s a dealbreaker. As a console gamer who grew up playing on 50Hz TVs at 25fps, I’m not going to throw my toys out of the pram over it. What’s far, far more pressing an issue than Redfall’s Xbox frame rate is its raft of other performance problems, from textures that take an absolute age to pop in (or don’t load at all), disappearing characters and animations, and other mission-breaking bugs. Sometimes my friends appeared completely stationary, sliding around the map like chess pieces, and sometimes they weren’t there at all – they were just a floating gun. On the other hand, sometimes a character appears but their gun doesn’t – making them look like they’re playing air guitar. During the climax of an early boss fight my character completely vanished from my friend’s screen, turning what could have been a satisfying team victory into a moment of bemused laughter. During one side mission I died trying to kill a vampire, but when I came back to finish the job he was just a non-interactive blue ghost, rotating to face me but otherwise rooted in place. When I came back again his energy shield was there, but the vampire… wasn’t in it. During a co-op session I found myself (more than once) fruitlessly attacking an enemy who was standing right in front of me but my friends saw as a dead body. At one stage, while playing solo, my <i>crouch and start buttons broke</i>. They just made clunking sounds. My inability to crouch persisted after death, but returned when I fast travelled to a safehouse. The start button doesn’t pause the game, by the way. It’s obviously understandable when playing online co-op, but completely baffling and inconvenient when playing solo. Right now Redfall is not the game I’d expected, certainly not following the excellent Deathloop, but you can check back with us later this week for our final assessment. i>Luke is Senior Editor and part of the IGN reviews team. You can chat to him on Twitter </i><a href=""https://twitter.com/MrLukeReilly"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><i><strong>@MrLukeReilly</strong></i></a><i>.</i Redfall is a bafflingly bad time across the board, whether playing solo or with a friend or three suffering alongside you. That it comes in the wake of Arkane’s excellent Deathloop, the enduringly beloved Prey, and the acclaimed Dishonored series honestly beggars belief. Its performance on Xbox Series X is regularly dire, plagued with pop-in, stutters, and a long list of display bugs. It’s beleaguered with bodgy AI enemies that struggle to mount a basic defence, choose appropriate cover, or even effectively navigate the world. The one-note mission design recycles and repurposes itself all the way until the anticlimactic final encounter. Button commands break, characters vanish, and the cheap and static story scenes seem woefully unfinished by typical standards. There may be occasional glimpses of a competent co-op shooter on display but otherwise, Redfall is just like a vampire in all the wrong ways. That is, it really wasn’t ready for daylight in this state, and it sucks. "
Age of Wonders 4 ,8,"In most 4X games, the achievements of your past civilizations only live on in animated discussions with friends over drinks later. Your Gandhi from a previous <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/26/sid-meiers-civilization-vi-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Civilization 6</a> campaign isn't going to come through a portal to save the day in a later one, with the scars of a nuclear war against Alexander the Great still marking his slender frame. That would be rad though. And it's a big part of why I've been coming back to Age of Wonders 4, as the rulers I led to victory actually do ascend to a mighty pantheon and become a recurring cast for future adventures. That's only the icing on top of a well-crafted fantasy strategy game with varied tactical battles and a near-perfect pace. Rather than telling the story of many alternate earths or distant galaxies, starting over on a fresh map is baked into the story of Age of Wonders 4, where powerful Sorcerer Kings teleport between many different realms in their quest for power and glory. And the way this encouraged me to think about a given run as a more digestible, if not exactly bite-sized, six- to twelve-hour sprint helps to build the sense of lasting investment in the progress of my pantheon. It's a great way to do account-level progression that doesn't feel forced, artificial, or over-monetized. At least in the review build, I didn't spot any sneaky microtransactions. The tendency lately to add them right after launch has put just about everyone on notice for me, but so far so good.  The quest for the ultimate fantasy strategy game will continue for a while longer, as Age of Wonders III only partially fits the bill. Still, it's a fairly successful return for a game series and style that seemed undeservedly buried. I have no doubt that the strength of the tactical combat will help find a strong niche, but for me, that just makes the relative weakness of the strategic side of gameplay all the more disappointing. - <i>Rowan Kaiser, April 2, 2014</i Read the full <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/02/age-of-wonders-3-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Age of Wonders 3 review</a>. Along the way, you can unlock neat new stuff from ruler cosmetics to functional combat items, to challenge maps like a frozen wonderland ruled over by a Chronicles of Narnia-esque ice queen that I really liked. And in addition to being very respectful of your time, these themed, story-based realms feel significantly different from just dropping into a standard 4X map with conquest, development, and research-based victory conditions – which you can also do, with tons of interesting customization options. Often, the victory condition in a story realm is to complete a series of quests culminating in a showdown with a memorable antagonist. I had such a good time with these, I almost found it hard to go back to the more traditional style of play. The other thing that had me planning two or three campaigns every time I started a new one is the in-depth, freeform empire creation tools. It's probably the most customization of this kind I've seen in a purely fantasy game, and I was especially excited by how it let me play against stereotypes. You can make noble orcs in shining armor who march dutifully to battle with holy words on their lips, or bloodthirsty cannibal elves who live for destruction. The visual aspect is mostly just cosmetic – it comes with some suggested racial traits that fit the classic fantasy version of each race, but you can of course change those out. Lanky dwarves who live above ground and love magic? Sure. Feline necromancers who ride around on giant spiders? Go for it. Your culture pick – Barbarian, Feudal, Mystic, and so on – defines most of your starting roster and how your empire's economy works. And there are only six of those. So if I were being harsh, I could say there are only <i>really</i> six playable civs with a lot of little bells and whistles to swap out. But the magical progression system that carries you through the ages does a lot to alleviate that feeling. Rather than technological ages, Age of Wonders 4 has five tiers of mystical tomes unlocked through research, each providing increasingly powerful units, spells, and campaign mechanics. They're divided into six alignments – Astral, Materium, Chaos, Order, Nature, and Shadow – with two tomes per alignment per tier that might be very thematically different. Within Chaos, for instance, you can focus on fire magic or revelrous, aggressive infantry like berserkers. Doubling down on one affinity or mixing and matching are both very viable, creating a practically absurd number of combinations for what your race might become by endgame. I especially love the racial transformations at certain tiers, which might turn your people into plant hybrids who can move much easier through forests, or frostlings who can build farms on snow. The cold never bothered them anyway. This amount of customization doesn't always come without some hitches, though. Remember that cool ice queen map I mentioned? I made a badass race of wolf-riding frost vikings to tackle it, but I found that its provinces were often affected by a modifier called Arctic Blizzards that isn't visible in any way on the map, and it blocks your units from healing even if they're parked in your capital city. You have to actually mouse over a unit to see if they have the modifier, meaning I was constantly marching my armies around in the snow to find a safe province where they wouldn't freeze to death. That's a pretty big oversight for such a punishing mechanic. And even completing their final transformation into beings of pure ice didn't remove the penalty! I found more strange edge cases like this the more tweaking I did with my campaign setups. Sure, you <i>can</i> play on a Dune-like desert world where everyone's capital starts underground, then infest it with Cthulhu monsters, but you might find the mechanics haven't really been fine-tuned for all the possible, weird combinations yet. The tactical battles, which take place on their own maps, aren't quite as exemplary as the strategic core of Age of Wonders 4, but they are just as fast-paced and can offer some seriously satisfying challenges. The bestiary is huge, with everything from ogres to astral monstrosities to demons spawning as neutral or hostile NPC factions, in addition to the forces of your rival civilizations. The one place it feels like kind of a letdown is when you're assaulting a major enemy city. It doesn't really feel like an epic struggle through the streets of a vast metropolis. At most, it's a scuffle over the outer defenses protecting what looks more like a village. But I did love seeing some of the bigger engagements that are possible with multiple armies on each side. I definitely have to applaud the graphics and UI as well. The balance Age of Wonders 4 strikes between realistic and stylized is just about perfect for me. Every unit, from a proud elven archer to a snarling wolf, is readable at a distance and projects a strong personality. The maps all look great, whether you're starting in a serene meadow or on some alien-looking astral plane. There's quite a bit of customization for your leader and units as well. And all the interface panes are well-organized, nice to look at, and easy to navigate. Nested tooltips make it easy to get just as much information as you want. And sometimes figure out what the hell the narrator is talking about when they bring up some lore concept from other games in the series you may not have played. As much as I enjoy building a legacy in a 4X game before starting over to do it all again, the fact that my legacy follows me in Age of Wonders 4 feels much more rewarding. And the faster pace of its very strong campaign mechanics and pretty good tactical battles make it feel like I can write a new chapter of this saga in a reasonable amount of time and still have time to do something else on my day off – especially with the very well-done story realms. Cranking all the dials up to maximum weirdness can lead to some edge cases that ruined my fun a bit, but it's not that big of a price to pay for the vast map and empire customization we get to play with. It really is wonderful. "
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor ,9,"At first I was afraid, I was petrified – I kept thinking ""how could Respawn follow up on its outstanding Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order?"" But then I spent so many nights playing the sequel finding out how they got it right and Cal Kestis grew strong, and I learned how to get along. And now we’re back, in outer space… okay, okay, don’t leave! I’ll stop. The point is that with vastly expanded combat options, bigger, more open maps, vastly more abilities to play with, and enough collectable stuff to fill a Correllian freighter, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is in many ways the Batman: Arkham City to Fallen Order’s Arkham Asylum. And much like the Arkham games did for Batman, nothing else convincingly captures playing as a Force user quite as well as this.   Especially considering that there’s no reason not to go back and play Fallen Order before starting Survivor if you haven’t, I greatly appreciate that the sequel starts you out with most of the powers and upgrades that Cal had already acquired – there’s no corny amnesia or other, “Oh no, my powers are gone!” gimmick to make you re-learn how to double-jump or use Force push, and no Jawas snuck up and stole away the climbing claws that make scaling walls much faster or the Scomp Link that lets BD-1 hack things. Outside of having to earn back your healing canisters and life and Force bar extensions, this is more or less Cal as we left him five years prior. So we’re already off to an exciting running start when things kick off with a brief caper on Imperial Coruscant that calls back to A New Hope before making a thrilling escape. You’re quickly thrown right back into Force-pushing Storm Troopers off of ledges and chaining together movement tricks like wall-running, climbing, swinging, and sliding down ramps. And that’s just the beginning – the Spider-Man-style grapple (which only works on pre-designated points) is introduced before you leave Coruscant, and the unlocks keep coming from there on at a rewarding pace. When you unlock the mid-air dash ability to pair with your double-jump, things really take off – you can cover such crazy distances without touching the ground, changing directions twice to reach things around corners, that I had to completely rethink what was possible. It’s not as though Survivor invented the air dash, but Respawn makes excellent use of it, further flexing those Titanfall muscles.  Moving around is definitely satisfying but lightsabers are, of course, the stars of the war. Survivor kicks up the excellent dueling from Fallen Order by several notches with five different fighting stances that are all brilliantly animated to create some of the flashiest and fiercest Star Wars melee battles I’ve ever seen. You don’t even have to be all that good at nailing the timing of strikes, parries, and dodges for fights to look spectacular and smooth as you carve a swath through enemies (but if you are it looks even cooler), and the fact that arms and legs can now sometimes get severed from Storm Troopers and other humanoids – not just droids and creatures, who get absolutely shredded – makes it feel more gratifyingly powerful than ever during kill animations. After dabbling in the single, double-bladed, and dual-wielding stances that carry over from Fallen Order, I settled on the two new ones: the Kylo Ren-inspired Crossguard style and the hybrid Blaster stance that answers the question of “wouldn’t it be cool if Han Solo were also a Jedi?” The Crossguard treats your lightsaber as a slow and heavy broadsword that’s great for hammering a stunned target into the floor, while the latter equips you with a sidearm to dispatch small enemies without having to close the gap and sure makes short work of flamethrower troopers, packs of animals, or others who like to get in close. It’s, quite literally, a blast. Of course, once I unlocked the ability to throw my Crossguard saber to hit enemies a little farther away I felt like either stance was capable of taking down just about any enemy when needed and settled in for the ride. These sabers pair nicely with the expanded set of Force powers that allow you to do things like pull in an entire group of enemies close before executing a spinning slash to cut them all down like blades of grass. You can only equip two of the five stances at any given time, which at first seemed artificially limiting – and it is, when you think about it – but I came to appreciate it because it gave my version of Cal more personality as a fighter. You can, of course, swap out your stances at any meditation circle, but especially in the early hours you only have so many skill points to go around (and only one free respec). Each stance has its own skill tree, so you’re encouraged to specialize, and by the time I reached the second half of the story I had my clear favorites, and no regrets. It’s a story that does the job it needs to do well: get you from one exciting action scene to the next. Early on and quite literally by falling into it by accident, Cal finds himself in a race to locate what’s effectively a map to a lost treasure planet. That’s very much in keeping with the idea of him as the Nathan Drake of the Star Wars universe, and leads to plenty of excuses to visit ancient (well, old and abandoned at least) puzzle chambers where you have to use your wits, the Force, and an expanded range of gadgetry to solve them. Importantly for a game like this, it seldom feels like there’s a lot of time pressure to rush to the next objective, so taking a detour on a side quest to investigate missing prospectors in a mine, find out what went wrong in a droid factory, or investigating the many other rumors you’re presented with by locals doesn’t feel like you’re neglecting a responsibility to save the galaxy. It’s been ages since we got a great single-player Star Wars action game, but Jedi: Fallen Order makes up for a lot of lost time. A strong cast sells a dark story while keeping things fun and loyal to Star Wars lore, and fast, challenging combat mixes with energetic platforming, decent puzzles, and diverse locations to explore for an all-around amazing game. <i>– Dan Stapleton, November 14, 2019</i Read the full <a href=""/respawn-entertainment-stig-asmussen-project/31315/review/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review"">Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order review</a Despite being a largely enjoyable adventure, my main issue with the story is that nearly every big twist is foreshadowed so heavily that it was only ever a matter of when a reveal would happen, not if. The identities of the main villains are secret as of now, and shall remain unspoiled here, but they’re pretty easy to see coming a lightyear away. In any case, at least they’re written and acted with enough depth that they don’t feel like retreads of anyone Cal’s faced before, and neither is a two-dimensional Sith Lord who somehow has returned. There’s more to them than that, as Survivor successfully prioritizes character over plot for the most part. The cast I enjoyed so much in Fallen Order is back in full force to go through those motions, and this time Cameron Monaghan’s Cal is not so easily outshined by the crew of the Mantis. His motivations are about more than simply fighting the Empire now: it’s about whether he can live a life where he’s something more than a resistance fighter, let go of his guilt, and find a home that’s safe. His path after escaping Order 66 is contrasted against what could’ve been if he’d had different priorities and made different choices. That gives him a lot more character growth than he had as purely a traumatized fugitive learning to be a Jedi. His decisions have more weight to them, making him a much more realized protagonist this time around. Naturally, BD-1 never left Cal’s side, but the rest of the crew are all given very human reasons for their parting ways after Fallen Order and why they’re coming back together now. Greez’s loveable cantankerousness made him a favorite, and he’s happy to deliver more of that along with some sage wisdom while carefully avoiding overuse of his “grab some seat” catchphrase as he pilots the Mantis. Merrin returns with a new look to immediately rekindle some of the romantic chemistry between herself and Cal, and her more casual attitude after having traveled the galaxy makes her even more endearing. And though she’s less of a constant presence due to Cal no longer needing a mentor, the ever-intense Cere is more powerful than ever, and that power is displayed memorably in one of Survivor’s biggest action moments. Aside from a large cast of colorful alien side characters, including an ancient protocol droid with a loose screw and a goofy sea slug with a reverse diving suit and a thick Scottish accent, the other new member of the group is Bode. He’s another roguish mercenary type who, much like Cal did in Fallen Order, initially comes across somewhat blandly as the two bro it up to establish the friendship they’ve struck up fighting the Empire together. As his sympathetic backstory is fleshed out, however, he does become a more interesting companion. Getting to fight alongside allies on certain story missions this time around is a treat, especially watching Merrin use her Nightcrawler-esque teleportation to blink around the battle and pick off targets (riding her coattails leads to Jedi Survivor’s single most thrilling action sequence). They can’t be killed or downed in action so there’s no management or babysitting you have to do, but if you want to, you can have them prioritize an especially annoying raider to keep them busy while you thin out his friends’ ranks. Beyond that, they’re only really used to open up paths for you to reach new areas, which boils down to you pushing a button when prompted, but their banter and companionship definitely liven up the scenes in a way BD-1’s adorable <i>bleeps</i> and <i>bwoops</i> couldn’t do alone. Of course, with new friends must also come enemies (it made sense in my head, at least), and following a whole game of battling mostly Imperial Inquisitors it’s a relief to see that the Empire’s role here is more in the background. Their parade of trooper types and security droids are mostly here to provide variety after you’ve been fighting the main enemy army of raiders and their salvaged Separatist battle droids. It’s a clever way to plausibly merge the original trilogy and prequel trilogy enemies together into the same game – one that takes advantage of the fact that Survivor takes place at nearly the exact midpoint between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope.  There’s also no shortage of beasts that resemble what we saw in Fallen Order – no matter where you go in the Star Wars galaxy, it seems life finds a way to make giant bugs and big angry wampas. It’s a good mix of enemies and subtypes that builds on Fallen Order’s already respectable lineup, and when I found myself in the middle of a fray where different factions are battling it out (including any weak-minded foes I’d temporarily Force-confused to my side) it’s a great time. On the subject of creatures, one of Cal’s many new abilities is to tame non-aggressive animals to be rideable mounts, though that isn’t ever used for much besides galloping across empty areas slightly faster than Cal could’ve run on foot. Given that running doesn’t drain his stamina, it seems that it’s mostly just for atmosphere and to make people stop asking Respawn if they can ride the animals. Granted, it is pretty cool to watch the towering, long-legged spamel carry you across the deserts of Jedah. (Yes, they really called an alien camel a spamel.) There’s also a flying animal that can be used as a glider, though only at very specific points, so it’s not much of a game-changer either, but it does play nicely into environmental puzzles. Speaking of environments, this journey takes us to a handful of never-before-seen planets, some of which are expansive and include a variety of extremely different areas within them. Koboh, for instance, has everything from grasslands to swamp to underground facilities, a massive crashed Separatist ship, and even its own version of Cloud City. They’re far from the typical Star Wars one-note worlds like Tatooine or the forest moon of Endor that are either 100 percent desert or completely covered in redwoods, respectively.  Every time I entered a new area I’d circle the camera, looking for the telltale signs the level designers leave to indicate a wall is runnable, a ceiling can be clung to, a crack can be squeezed through, and more. By the time I was done with my 30-hour run through the story I had trouble even remembering to use all of the abilities I had learned because there are simply so many. Levels are meticulously thought-out puzzles in and of themselves, and only rarely did I run across something that didn’t feel intuitive or fair once I took into account all the tools at my disposal. Considering that this adventure is roughly equal parts combat and puzzle-solving, the fact that there’s such a broad selection of types works in its favor. Puzzles that deal with directing energy beams and even painting paths are clever and well done, on par (and sharing some ideas) with a lot of what we saw in God of War Ragnarok last year. Some involve using BD-1 to launch projectiles to trigger remote switches, some have rolling homing bombs, and some use deployable balloons you can grapple to and launch off of. A few of the main storyline puzzles gave me cause to scratch my head for a few minutes before the solution sprung to mind, which is just about the right level of challenge. They aren’t groundbreaking in their design, but consistently fun nonetheless. Throughout it all, Survivor is a gorgeous game with beautifully detailed environments and characters… and perhaps as a result, not one of the best performing. My PS5 playthrough saw some fairly gnarly slowdowns from the expected 30 frames per second in 4K Quality Mode, especially when fighting around smoke or fog, which made timing by parries and dodges difficult. Disappointingly, even the 1440p Performance Mode isn’t close to holding a locked 60fps. I also saw a few crashes and bugs that forced me to quit and reload my save to progress (though this was before the day one patch). EA has naturally promised more patches will come with improvements on all platforms, but if history is any guide it might take a little while before it’s completely ironed out.  A smooth frame rate is certainly important when battling Survivor’s multiple lightsaber-wielding bosses, because there’s no shortage of challenge in learning the timing of parrying their strikes and dodging their unblockable attacks. I must confess: after several hours of banging my head against the <i>brutal</i> final boss I finally resorted to turning the difficulty down a notch to see the ending in time for this review, which hurt my pride because I’d made it to his final phase but couldn’t quite get over the finish line. That said, there’s not a lot that felt especially novel about these fights; they’re well made, but conventional and one aspect that hasn’t seen a great improvement from Fallen Order. One smart tweak that does stand out, however, is that when a boss kills you, the next time you come at him he’s not glowing yellow signifying you’ll get your health back the first time you hit him like a normal enemy does. Instead, there’s a glowing pillar of light where you fell, and picking that up heals you. That allows you to save the full-health pick-up for when you need it rather than just as the fight begins – it’s a smart and welcome evolution of Fallen Order’s already ingenious system of tipping the scales in your favor when you need it. When it comes to tracking those bosses down in the first place, I certainly appreciate that the Jedi games give you a map (unlike other games of this style that I could name that delight in making you figure it out) but it does leave something to be desired when it comes to usability. Just like in Fallen Order, this map seems so dedicated to the idea of resembling a light-blue Star Wars hologram that it’s not always easy to figure out what you’re looking at and the directions its waypoints give you aren’t always accurate. However, its dotted lines were generally good enough to point me in the right direction when I struggled to find a path forward or was feeling lost, or redirect me when I was trying to figure out a way past an obstacle I didn’t have the right gear for yet. Also, this time Respawn has granted us the ability to fast-travel between save points, which feels like an act of mercy when the objective is on the other side of one of these large, labyrinthian maps.  These maps are dense, too, and Survivor is packed full of stuff to do around the edges of the main story, including bounty hunters and legendary creatures to track down and kill, combat challenges, and more. Some of them are seriously tough, even on the default Jedi Knight difficulty level; I cannot tell you how many times I got one-hit killed by that damn rancor’s grab-and-snack attack, other than that it was literally dozens. But I got him in the end! You’ll also unlock a full New Game+ mode once you beat the story, which is a welcome feature that Fallen Order didn’t have until more than six months after launch. On top of all of that, there’s an intimidating amount of stuff to collect, including plants and fish which can then be displayed in the cantina in your base town on Koboh. But while there might be some unlocks at the end of those sidequests, it doesn’t do much to convince you that these are activities you should spend a lot of time on… unless you really like plopping down seeds on rooftop gardens or watching a virtual aquarium.  Of course some rewards are much more enticing to a Star Wars fan. Cal’s lightsaber and blaster both have many customizable cosmetic parts that you can mix and match to form your own creation, and even though you can barely make out those details when you’re using it in a fight unless you zoom in with the photo mode, it’s a fantastic, loving bit of Star Wars detail to obsessively mess with whenever you find a new piece.  Plus, all of the available lightsaber blade colors are unlocked shortly after the start so that you can make Cal more your own from the very beginning. That also goes for his range of clothing options, which is far more extensive this time around, as well as his entirely new haircut and beard options. He’ll always be the same Cal Kestis underneath it, but your soul-patch and mullet-wearing character will have a very different vibe from mine, whose crew cut and beard resembles a redheaded version of Amos Burton from The Expanse. Yes, it’s a little silly to find hair and beard options in treasure chests, but sure, why not?  Similarly, I’m just delighted at the customization for BD-1. In the first game, you could only change his paint job, but his enduring popularity (which led to his Mandalorian cameo) has paid dividends because now we get many more options for components on his face, head, “ears,” body, and legs, as well as detailed color options and even the level of wear and tear. Just wait until you see the way his body reacts to having pieces swapped out in the customization menu! It’s another lovely little touch in a game that presents so many. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor takes what Fallen Order achieved and wall-runs with it, then double-jumps and air-dashes straight into an epic lightsaber battle. Rather than taking us back to square one to begin Cal’s journey as a Padawan again, we’re trusted with control of a full-fledged Jedi Knight who we can grow into a master of superhuman mobility and fantastic and challenging combat. With a new set of larger, more diverse, and densely packed worlds to explore and a memorable cast of returning characters, Survivor tells a story that may be predictable but is still fun and at times emotional to watch play out. Launch performance issues aside, it’s a sequel that does virtually everything better than the original – which was already an exceptional Star Wars game. If Respawn makes one more like this it’ll complete the best Star Wars trilogy in 30 years, hands down. "
Dredge ,8,"I didn’t know I needed a cosmic horror-fueled fishing game in my life – at least, not until I played Dredge. It’s not exactly a full-blown management sim ala Fishing Planet, but this 12-hour expedition through haunted open waters is both mysterious and compelling enough to tickle my brain and tug on all the right heartstrings. I felt possessed into flinging myself overboard with an unhinged smile cast across my lips, like one of its many macabre characters. …Figuratively speaking. Starting small and slow is a challenge, but upgrading my fishing boat led Dredge to spout forth a flurry of meaningful improvements to my fishing speed, inventory capacity, and my ability to scope out and evade the plethora of dangers that might rear their ugly heads at night. Managing this fishing boat is no plank walk; five unique zones fit cozily within its relatively compact open world, hiding enough secrets, quests, and unique varieties of cartilaginous fish to fill its duration without overstaying its welcome.  All I know is that I’m a contract fisherman who’s rescued by the townsfolk of a remote island settlement called Greater Marrow. I’m given a new boat and… that’s all. But due to Dredge’s simple fishing and movement mechanics, this is pretty much all I need to know before I can begin my quest for fish on the open ocean, and it’s there that I’m immediately treated to a gorgeous sunrise stretching over the horizon. Leaving the bay of Greater Marrow for the first time and drinking in the sights and sounds is a treat. It’s in its favor that it’s so simple to pick up, both because its mesmerizing low-poly art style is so centric to its story and because it doesn’t really need me to understand too much to enjoy it. There’s no combat to speak of; just sail around, catch fish, solve the occasional puzzle, and try to return home in one piece. In fact, most of Dredge’s story revolves around simple fishing minigames that just have you pressing the DualSense controller’s square button in a specific rhythm according to directions on screen. It’s forgiving, in that no matter how many times you mess up the prompts, you won’t lose the fish, only in-game hours. I even had a friend momentarily take over my controller through the PS5’s SharePlay feature and reveled in watching how quickly they were able to pick up the mechanics. Controlling your boat through tight spaces and navigating harsh waters is a breeze since moving forward and backward (and braking) is as simple as moving the left thumbstick back and forth. It’s an enjoyable added touch that progressing through each step of the main quest unlocks additional movement abilities, like the Haste skill that gives a speed boost that’s especially useful when getting out of the way of a hungry sea monster – but comes with the risk of destroying an engine and damaging your hull if you don’t give it intermittent rests. Dredge’s story is intentionally cryptic at first glance, with your ship’s bow providing minimal context to the series of events unraveling in front of your eyes. But what starts out as a relaxing fishing trip rapidly takes a darker turn through threatening encounters with the ocean’s natural and supernatural denizens – who turn hostile after dark. This tension is fleshed out through genuinely interesting and well-thought-out dialogue with townsfolk between quests, and the broader story’s concealed undercurrents are cleverly pieced together in bottled notes found amidst the waves. Tactfully breaking up its fishing minigames with these elements, Dredge gradually unveiled its hidden agenda and latched onto my brain like a series of parasites slithering onto my boat’s deck. Which is something that actually happens, in more than a few cases.  Things heat up at night when the fog rolls in and your panic meter begins to increase in the darkness. The higher it goes, the more likely it is that monsters and other obstacles will spawn, so you have to balance that against turning on lights to temporarily lower panic. Of course, light attracts monsters that will quickly destroy your boat’s hull if you don’t evade them, so it’s a bit more challenging to manage than a simple fishing game. That brings balance and danger to every expedition. Adding even more challenge, the world shifts around at night, meaning I sometimes ended up running headfirst into a rock that definitely wasn’t there during the daytime. For this reason, it’s never a great idea to make a beeline for the nearest port of call when panic sets in. At least, not without making sure the next few feet in front of you are clear, which is made easier by upgrading your boat with bigger, brighter lights. This interaction between systems gives Dredge a layer of strategy that keeps things interesting even when I’m not making substantial progress on the main quest. The Greater Marrow lighthouse remains a central landmark no matter where you are on the map, but you still need to get there safely on your own gumption if you find yourself lost at sea. And because there is only one limited method of fast travel, the stakes are raised even further if you find yourself adrift after dark. Since time only moves when you move your ship or play a fishing minigame, the constant, creeping fear of being snuck up on by a rogue sunset keeps my watchful eye pinned to the clock – which conveniently sits overhead – at all times.  Thanks to all that, I often found myself pulled along with Dredge’s current, solving puzzles and gathering hidden relics as I carefully built up my ship and kept a stream of currency rolling in. Following the main quest is crucial to unlocking advanced fishing rods and nets, but most objectives are bite-sized, adding up to little more than fetch quests. They’re made more worthwhile by the fact that each one contains interesting writing that fleshes out the world’s lore or is somehow tied to the broader story, and the cast of characters are interesting and likable until the end. Likewise, completing quests is necessary to loosely flesh out your encyclopedia of up to 128 fish, but it’s nice that I didn’t need to catch ‘em all if I didn’t want to. But if you do want to, you’ll need to grind. Each species of fish only shows up in certain environments that require specialized gear to fish in, and most only appear at certain times of day, including species that are necessary to solve certain puzzles and progress the main story. This made it important to max out my ship’s hull so it could survive the long treks to other zones, which inevitably meant traveling at night.  Upgrading the ship’s hull largely centers around scavenging coastal shipwrecks – an activity that’s a little more monotonous than it needs to be, given how sparse resources can be, and how hard it can be to find certain crucial items like wooden planks early on. This is the main upgrade path that I spent most of my time working on, accounting for most of the heavy lifting in terms of improving my ship’s critical functions. But the upgrade path is disappointingly linear, and a <i>lot</i> of grinding is involved in maxing it out. Moreover, if one were to play to the end and max everything out, their boat will be exactly like mine, minus a select few deviations in some equipment choices, so the decisions I made along the way didn’t end up feeling meaningful. The tugboat is as fragile as it looks, meaning it takes only a few collisions – even small ones – to send you back to the dock from which you most recently set sail. Full disclosure: autosaves are frequent in Dredge, conveniently taking place whenever you bring your ship into any port. Plus, docks are scattered liberally across the world map, so it never feels like a safe haven is too far away to have a fair chance at evading danger. It’s great then that dropping anchor at a friendly settlement and sleeping through the night can eliminate your panic gauge so that you get a fresh start at the beginning of the following day. This allows me to fully appreciate moments of tension, since its difficulty always feels just balanced enough to provide a challenge and a handful of scares without ever crossing a line or feeling unfair. I enjoyed getting to specialize my research tree with a scarce resource that unlocks specialized and increasingly powerful nets, rods, and engines – giving me at least some leeway to craft my own build. These choices would move me in the direction of certain quests faster, depending on which zones I wanted to explore first. For example, I installed a fishing rod early on that granted access to Volcanic fishing holes, letting me solve the quests in the volcano-themed Devil’s Spine zone at my own leisure.  It’s also really smooth. I can’t think of a single moment I ran into a bug or a crash in my entire 12 hours playing Dredge, and this might be the first game in recent memory I’m able to say this about. On the PS5, the DualSense controller emits satisfying pulses of feedback in response to the motion of the ocean, and even with a basic soundbar, the ambiance makes a strong impression. Dredge erupted out of the left field as 2023’s most unforgettably creepy fishing simulator. Without spoiling anything, its slow dive into Lovecraftian horror intermingles with subtle elements of seabound thrillers like Jaws and Moby Dick, and yet despite its twists, its fishing and sailing mechanics are simple enough to be relaxing – just as long as you don’t stay out past dark. Its colorful graphics, intelligent story, and seafaring sound design are alluring, but calling it a management sim betrays how simple and approachable it is. Though it still may not excite anyone in search of abyssal depths, its world map, upgrade tree, and story offer more than enough interesting decisions of their own to make a 12-hour fishing expedition feel concise. At the same time, a lack of combat and meaningful customization give little weight to its excessive grinding, and these are clear opportunities for improvement on the next voyage. "
Disney Speedstorm Early Access ,5,"You may have heard Disney Speedstorm was going to launch as a free-to-play kart racer from the crew behind Gameloft’s long-running Asphalt series. In fact, you may have heard this because that’s what we told you about it back when it was unveiled in June last year. Well, that’s changed. It’s still a kart racer from the Asphalt team, but it’s not actually going to officially launch in its free-to-play state until late 2023 or early 2024. What we have in its place is an “Early Access” version of Speedstorm that just… costs money to play – which, of course, is how all good video games worked before the game industry started copying the gambling industry’s homework. However, despite packing an entirely decent brand of arcade racing action on track, Speedstorm’s drowning level of gacha guff and free-to-play DNA may leave those shelling out a fee to play feeling a little goofy. For those of you curious about how Speedstorm’s Early Access program works – and what you’ll receive for your money beyond simply being able to play it – a <a href=""https://disneyspeedstorm.com/news/disney-speedstorm-early-access-faq"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">5,000-word FAQ awaits you on its official website</a>. This is roughly 4,950 more words than I generally like to absorb before playing what’s ostensibly a family-friendly kart racer. At any rate, if you come out the other side of that under the impression Speedstorm is a mobile game masquerading as a PC and console game, know that in its current Early Access state that feels like a fairly accurate way to describe it.  This is unfortunate for a few reasons, though none more so than the fact that, on track, Speedstorm is a plucky little arcade combat kart racer. It’s got a great drift feel in particular, with easy mid-slide adjustment that allows us to open them up into long, low-angle powerslides. There’s also a really satisfying ability to transition between drift directions very smoothly. With responsive controls and a good sense of weight to the karts as they jostle on track and crash back to the course from jumps, I really don’t have any complaints about the handling at all – and that’s obviously a massively crucial part of any kart racer equation. That, and four-player split-screen – which thankfully Speedstorm has, albeit only on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. PS4, Xbox One, and Switch only get two-player. There are also some interesting layers to the combat, with items able to be used in different ways depending on how you activate them. For instance, a fire pickup can be tapped to send flames licking from the side of your kart that will stun any opponents you touch, or charged over a few seconds to trigger a blast all around you that can knock out multiple other racers simultaneously. The jellyfish pickup can be triggered to make you temporarily invisible, or it can be charged to become an attacking forcefield that will actually explode and take out opponents. There’s just a little more depth to the combat here than usual, and I can appreciate that. Each of the characters also has a distinct themed power-up. Donald Duck, for instance, gets a protective raft that turns into a ghostly flurry of fists. I like these close-quarters attacks over the ranged ones, and they seem to work well with my driving style and Speedstorm’s tightly bunched racing. I also have a lot of time for Donald Duck because he’s angry, a World War II veteran, and he’s too proud for pants. On that note, the dartboard approach to Disney characters represented in Speedstorm has resulted in a pretty random shortlist of characters and tracks for launch, with The Jungle Book, Hercules, The Pirates of the Caribbean, Mulan, Beauty and the Beast, and Monsters, Inc. making the cut alongside Mickey and his mates. The modern race suits are a cute touch but I reckon the art team has missed a trick with the vehicles, which seem super vanilla compared to the karts of something like Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed, which are brimming with personality to match their drivers. The selection has made for tracks that all boast sufficiently different atmospheres – from a dank pirate port to the Monsters, Inc. factory, and from Disney’s black-and-white origins to the opulence of Mount Olympus – but they’re not especially technical and don’t tend to feel very different to one another during the moment-to-moment racing. The bigger problem is, despite seemingly boasting several track ribbons per environment, the courses reuse such significant sections I’m simply never able to tell them apart within locations. There’s more variety in the remixed music tracks than the racing tracks. As a result, Speedstorm begins to feel very repetitive very early. It doesn’t help that this solo format of one-off races is frankly a bit boring – and when your competition is incumbents like the untouchable Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and the terrific Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled, that’s a problem. Obviously I’m fully aware that, with its destiny as a live service game, there’s no doubt that there’s a whole wad of new tracks in the pipe set to arrive at regular intervals – but they’re not here yet. So what are you buying right now? Some digital tokens and an exclusive racing suit that tells people you were here before they were? That’s a tough sell. This brings us to the point where this 40-year-old dad checks out both physically and spiritually, because gacha-style, mobile-inspired upgrade and currency systems are like absolute kryptonite to me. Put clearly, the sheer amount of menu nonsense and overlapping economies in Speedstorm is simply absurd. Tokens are blue. You earn these from completing objectives during races and moving up reward tiers, and we will apparently be able to buy Tokens to access locked content faster. Then there are tokens that are <i>like</i> Tokens, but yellow. These are Season Coins. You get these from moving through the Golden Pass, which is Speedstorm’s battlepass equivalent. I bought <i>that</i> with a Golden Pass Credit. That’s <i>another</i> currency that came with the Early Access pack, separate to the Tokens and Season Coins. Then there are the Seasonal Tickets and Universal Box Credits, which seem like Tokens but they’re purple. Also separate are the Multiplayer Coins, which are tokens that naturally come from competing online. There’s ranked multiplayer racing, where you take your characters in at whatever level you have them, and “regulated” racing, where racer stats are standardised. I’ve won races in both, but kart racing seems quite soulless racing against strangers and I can’t understand the appeal. It belongs on the couch, if you ask me. You’ll have to do it if you want to use the Speedstorm shop, though, because sometimes things <i>cost </i>Multiplayer tokens. However, some other things cost blue tokens, and some things cost yellow tokens. Sometimes they cost a purple one, because why not? Sometimes items are just there, a la carte, and sometimes they’re in a blind box. Did I mention there are different types of boxes? There are different types of boxes. Then there are Racer Shards, which are essentially another currency unique to each individual character that you use to unlock racers and upgrade your characters’ star levels, and then there are upgrade materials, which also stack as basically <i>another</i> currency you also need to upgrade your characters. You’ll need to do that to keep up with the competition. <i>This</i> stuff can be found in the loot boxes you earn playing, rewarded via the Golden Pass, or simply bought from the shop with one of several currencies. Maybe in a box. Maybe not. For 1,200 Tokens I bought 20 Mulan shards, which are automatically traded for one Mulan star. I want to make my Mike Wazowski faster, but now I need four Scare Tanks, one turbo, and four wrenches, and I'm short two wrenches. Did anybody say any of this out loud? Are you still following? Because frankly I don’t think I am anymore. The mechanical monkey in my brain just backflipped off a building. I haven’t even got to the crew mechanic, which appears to be JPGs of other random Disney characters here to be <i>another thing</i> you need to upgrade. Or the Loot Points. Or the Collection Level, which are points, but different. Are kids meant to understand this? This doesn’t sound like a game; it sounds like a job. Disney Speedstorm in Early Access is a fundamentally good kart racer that’s currently too light on tracks and too repetitive to warrant the required investment. Worse still, it’s buried beneath a veritable Splash Mountain of gacha garbage and so many discrete currencies that do different things that it almost seems like a parody of the entire free-to-play genre. Nothing sucks like gacha, plucks your bucks like gacha, makes you jump through hoops for Donald Duck like gacha. "
Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp ,8,"While I have always favored the <a href=""/fire-emblem-engage/63190/review/fire-emblem-engage-review"">Fire Emblem</a> franchise as my Nintendo turn-based tactical game of choice, the Advance Wars series has always held a special place in my heart ever since the first time I booted it up on my Game Boy Advance 22 years ago. I’ve always enjoyed how these games encourage me to get creative with my units and strategies. Whether that is hiding my army in the fog of war and taking advantage of the terrain to obliterate my opponents before they know what’s hitting them, or building a massive platoon of tanks and steamrolling the enemy with my oppressive numbers. It’s rewarding to see my plans work out as intended, and though it stings when they fail, I feel like I always learn something about how to improve my future strategies.   Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp may not have a large variety in its game modes, but the amount of variables you can swap around to your liking makes each battle feel fresh even when replaying maps. The improvements to the visuals and music of the original, in addition to the inclusion of other modernizations like voice acting, animated shorts, and online play, make it a great way to experience these classics for veterans and newcomers alike. My 60 hours with Re-Boot Camp took me through both campaigns, including alternative missions with different characters that unlocked after completing each campaign, warring with AI on a variety of unlockable maps, spending time designing my own maps, and a small taste of online multiplayer. It took 15 and 25 hours to complete each respective campaign on the classic difficulty setting (the hardest available from the start). Even having turned it up a notch, the difficulty curve for the original Advance Wars is consistently on the easier end thanks to many of the missions mostly serving as tutorials for new mechanics, win conditions, introducing new commanding officers (COs), and more – it’s not until the final missions of each section of the campaign that things pick up. But once you reach the Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising campaign it starts to include a lot more missions with some surprising difficulty spikes due to the introduction of the new Black Hole army COs and their powerful new abilities. While the missions may not always be difficult, some ended up taking a while to finish due to the scope of battles where you control multiple armies, or tactical errors on my part, like losing my last infantry unit to hidden artillery, requiring me to spend a large number of extra turns to wipe out the enemy army instead of capturing the enemy base in two or three turns. The good news is that if you were hoping for more of a challenge, finishing each campaign unlocks a new Challenge difficulty that has started to push some of my previous winning strategies to their limits, causing me to reassess which CO and strategy to use on each map when given a choice. It would’ve been nice for that mode to be available from the start for those of us who already know our way around this series. Re-Boot Camp has updated the Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising campaigns with a charming new art style thanks to the use of 3D graphics, a fantastic re-recorded soundtrack, online multiplayer, and a few features like the ability to restart a turn to help newcomers learn from their mistakes, and the option to fast-forward battle animations to reduce the time between turns if you like. The soundtrack is one of the highlights for me, as each CO has a distinct musical theme during their turns which helps each battle feel fresh. Grit from the Blue Moon Army has a bit of a bluegrass style to mirror his laid-back attitude, while the theme from the Yellow Comet’s Sensei uses a piano and saxophone to give an upbeat jazz feel to his turns. Outside of the updated visuals and new features, Re-Boot Camp maintains its faithful retelling of the wars between the various nations of Cosmo and Macro Land and the mysterious Black Hole Army, meaning if you were hoping to see any of the new additions or changes included in later games like Dual Strike or Days of Ruin, you will still need to boot up your DS for that experience. (The attention to detail in nearly every area of Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp does give me hope that the third and fourth games will get the same treatment next.) While neither story is what I would call deep, they both have their brighter moments, with the Black Hole Rising campaign being an improvement thanks to the addition of the new COs and their various personalities. In addition to the Orange Star army COs, commanding officers from the other nations get a modest amount of voice acting that helps to show off each of the characters’ unique personalities. The performances aren’t anything to write home about, but that is more based on the lack of quantity than the quality of them. One of the most intriguing additions is the inclusion of a few animated shorts that had me wondering if we might get an Advance Wars animated show down the road now that Nintendo has seen so much success with the Mario movie.   Each of the COs has their own specialty when building armies, as well as a unique power that can help turn the tide in combat. The spirited but inexperienced mechanic Andy is well-rounded with no bonuses or penalties but has the ability to restore health to his units with his hyper-repair power, making him a safe choice in most battles. The straightforward and brawny Max gives a power boost to all direct damage units while his indirect units, like artillery or rockets, suffer a penalty to their maximum range, making him a good option for when you want to punch through an enemy’s defenses and overwhelm them with raw power. Advance Wars 2 adds new depth to the formula by including Super CO powers. These often add alternatives to traditional CO powers, like utility effects – such as refilling your unit's ammunition and fuel or increasing your vision range in the fog of war. The happy-go-lucky special forces commander Sami grants large bonuses to her infantry units when she activates her Super CO power, giving them the ability to capture buildings in a single turn, including enemy HQs, to sneak a victory out of even the direst of situations. It’s important to know each one's strengths and weaknesses otherwise, even the best-laid plans can come undone. While many battles in Advance Wars can devolve into a contest of who has the superior numbers, using the proper units in the right positions can help neutralize even the largest of armies. One of the most common tactics is to place a more durable unit, like the medium tank, on a bridge to prevent your opponent's advance and then barraging their army with artillery or rockets to reduce their numbers so you can go on the offensive. Building an army of units that cover land, air, and sea gives a lot of versatility to strategies across most maps, and building to your CO's strengths will often tip the scale in your favor. Battles waged in the air are best with the use of COs like Eagle or Sensei, who give large boosts to various aerial units, while Grit’s long range makes it easy to overwhelm opponents from the shadows on maps that have fog of war. At the end of a mission, Advance Wars will grade you based on speed, power, and technique. So the faster you are at claiming victory while efficiently destroying your opponent's units without losing your own, the higher the rating you will earn, meaning more currency to unlock new maps, music, and COs for game modes outside the campaign. This helps to improve the mileage you will get out of Advance Wars, since its replayability depends on the unlockable content, so the better you rank, the faster you can unlock more of the content to give you more options and extend your play further.  Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp’s customizable War Room is one of the areas where I got the most replayability out of it, and foresee it earning the bulk of my time moving forward. Being able to take on the role of any CO on a sizeable number of maps against a variety of AI-controlled opponents with a variety of customizable parameters like fog of war, weather, and victory conditions means there is almost no limit to the ways you can make each battle feel different, even when revisiting favorite maps. And if the included maps start to feel too familiar, the Design Room map editor is another way to make it feel new again and is only limited by your creativity. Anything you see in the campaigns is at your fingertips, so if you want to build a map that's all water and play an Advance Wars version of Battleship, you can. Afterward, you can share those maps online, so if you have a good group of creative friends, you can swap maps for an effectively limitless amount of content.  The online multiplayer in Re-Boot Camp is one of the biggest letdowns for me in that there’s no matchmaking system at all. That means you can only compete against opponents on your friends list, so if you happen to be the only person in your group of friends who owns it, you’re going to either need to make some more friends or get comfortable only competing against the AI. On current-generation hardware like the Switch, it’s just plain disappointing not to have a matchmaking lobby. Thankfully, it does have the option for local multiplayer on either the same console or with others on their own Switch, meaning that it will surely see some popularity at various conventions and gatherings. With nicely redone graphics and excellent music bringing the classic turn-based tactical action up to modern standards, Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp is a great return for this long-neglected series and gives me hope for a follow-up that includes the DS games. While there isn’t much variety in the game modes, Advance Wars’ depth comes from the number of variables you can adjust to make every match feel unique. The biggest miss is the lack of multiplayer matchmaking, which makes it harder to get into a game than it ought to be in 2023, but at least you can play online. Playing against the AI will keep me interested in the short term, but I predict the inability to play against random opponents online will limit my spontaneous play sessions. However, the sheer number of maps, playable COs, and options for each match means that when I do, it's sure to be a unique experience. "
The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story ,7,"Magic is everywhere if you know where to look, and you need look no further than Digital Sun’s The Mageseeker. It’s a worthy addition to the growing list of League of Legends spinoffs, this time a pixel-art action RPG puts you in the role of Sylas The Unshackled as he escapes from prison to seek his revenge against those that locked him away since his childhood. It’s faithful to the lore of League of Legends and expands on it in exciting new ways, showing us even more of the spell-stealing rebel. I came away from my time with The Mageseeker enjoying the journey but wishing it had taken a few different paths along the way. Following in the footsteps of other League of Legends spinoffs like Ruined King and Hextech Mayhem, The Mageseeker brings another batch of characters from their 160+ champion roster to life in a new way. Sylas is depicted in a bigger way than ever before as he helps to lead a rebellion against the tyrannical kingdom of Demacia, where mages are hunted. The story has some nuance and even lightly parallels moments of real-world history where a group of people has been persecuted for being different.  It took around 18 hours to not only finish The Mageseeker on the hard difficulty, but also complete everything necessary for the platinum trophy on PlayStation 5. This included all the sidequests, replaying a handful of missions to gather any collectibles I missed on my first playthrough, and a handful of restarts against a few bosses who gave me a bit of trouble. You only ever play as Sylas, but The Mageseeker brings along a few other fan-favorite characters like Morgana, Garen, Lux, Jarvan IV, Shyvana, and a few surprises that I won’t spoil along for the ride. I had a lot of fun seeing how Digital Sun envisioned just how powerful these champions could be when not constrained by the need to be balanced in a competitive landscape. Morgana’s Dark Bindings last longer, Lux’s lasers are larger than life, and Shyvana gets to show her true scale when transforming into her dragon form. There are also plenty of Easter eggs and other fun nods throughout the story that are sure to please fans of League of Legends. In addition to those familiar faces, Sylas is joined by some entertaining original characters who take on different supporting roles throughout the story of vengeance, growth, and rebellion. There are a few standouts, such as Leilani, who forms a strong bond with Sylas early on and serves as the guiding light of the rebellion while Sylas does what must be done on their journey in the hope of freeing themselves from the persecution of the Mageseekers who are out to imprison or eliminate them.  The Mageseeker begins with a literal bang as Sylas borrows the magic of a young Lux to make his escape from his Demacian prison and upcoming execution. Though the first mission seems momentous, it hits a bit of a slowdown early on as Sylas comes into the role of rebel leader. The Mageseeker absolutely nails the feeling of playing Sylas: the way you can repeatedly dash, use your chains to pull yourself to enemies or around the environment, and all the spells you can borrow and use for your own purposes. Anyone who has played a match of League of Legends as Sylas will be right at home when in combat, though the mechanics are intuitive enough that even those who haven’t should be able to pick it up just as easily. As Sylas, you have the ability to sense and borrow the magical abilities of others and use them against anyone who stands in your way. Including powerful ultimate abilities I gained access to 30 different spells most of which fell into six different elemental trees, nearly all of which played a useful role in various moments as I progressed. Early spells included elemental projectiles to counter enemies with opposing affinities, while the later spells granted large area-of-effect versions or spells for healing, shielding, or imbuing my melee strikes with elemental buffs. Spells stolen from enemies are single-use, but as you progress you gain the ability to craft spells you’ve borrowed and can cast them as you see fit, as long as you have the mana to do so. Combat starts out simple, but in the later levels, when facing larger groups of enemies and their numerous projectiles, I found that if I wasn’t staying mobile and dashing or pulling myself to enemies I’d lose large chunks of health. While I primarily focused on using spells that either recovered my health or granted me a shield, that was more about my playstyle than out of necessity: there are plenty of options, and the ability to swap out your spells at any of the generous checkpoints placed throughout the stages gives even more flexibility. In addition to standard spells, Sylas will also gain access to powerful ultimate abilities that, for the most part, enable him to deal massive amounts of damage but also temporarily boost his power. Using Lux’s ultimate, Final Spark, to fire a large concentrated beam of light to disintegrate large groups of enemies is almost as enjoyable as securing multiple kills with the same ability in regular League of Legends matches. There is plenty of enemy diversity, and they range from elemental mages employed by the Mageseekers that cast spells to hurl shards of ice, heal other enemies, or create cyclones of damaging wind. As well as creature based enemies ranging from fiery frogs named lava gromps that fans of League will recognize who can create fields of fire, as well as other larger beasts that summon homing beams of lightning, like the gorilla-lizard hybrid Thunderbeasts. Levels continually mixed up the arrangements of enemies, adding a nice level of depth that kept me on my toes when it came to deciding which enemies to prioritize. Most stages are very straightforward and follow a similar pattern of simple platforming using Sylas’ chains or dashes to cross short gaps, a few enemy encounters that need to be cleared before a door or gate unlocks, and a boss that typically incorporates the elements from the rest of the level. I would have liked to have seen some additional elements in the levels, such as light puzzles or optional platforming challenges to make me earn the rewards placed throughout the map, rather than just being given them as a reward for exploring. There are numerous unlit braziers and other objects in the background that could have been used for triggering something magical like a hidden passage or revealing a chest, but I was always disappointed that casting fire spells on them didn’t do anything. It’s a missed opportunity to encourage replayability and creative use of spells. The bosses, though, are one of the biggest highlights in Mageseeker. While I could get away with whatever spell loadout I wanted in some battles thanks to Sylas’s excellent mobility, others benefited greatly from swapping out my equipped spells to give me an elemental advantage or boost my survivability with heal or shield spells. On the hard difficulty level, many of the earlier bosses would wipe me out in four to six, hits depending on the attack. It became a bit more forgiving once I’d picked up some health and defense upgrades towards the middle of the campaign, only for the steep challenge to return in the final hours of the campaign with an increased volume of more powerful enemies; thankfully this is balanced by the addition of more ways to heal or mitigate damage.  This created a new dynamic of requiring me to decide on how best to use my mana, either recovering my health or dishing out more damage with flashy spells In addition to the main missions, there are two chains of sidequests. One had me assaulting Mageseeker bases using uniquely empowered versions of my spells, giving these levels almost a roguelike feel that offered some of the most fun in the entire campaign, despite how the side missions reuse the same bosses. The other chain of missions is a series of basic arenas that end with some of the more exciting bosses that fans of League of Legends will want to see. Levels are also filled with various collectibles, such as the adorable silverwings, mages to recruit, and notes dropped by characters that help offer more background information on the state of the world or their lives.  The musical score is filled with fast tempos to match the often chaotic battles, paired with relaxing rhythms during your time in base between levels.  Each location has its own style, with the music evolving as you progress further, and culminates into an exhilarating melody during the boss battles. The Mageseeker remains faithful to its source material by using various voice lines and sound effects from League of Legends as characters cast their abilities, and while there is limited voice acting, overall it's still entertaining to hear familiar elements outside of their normal environment.  I did run into a few bugs during my playthrough: I had enemies and bosses become unkillable, lost the ability to use my chains to grapple or borrow abilities, and one peculiar one where a falling rock followed me wherever I went, including the main menu. It was nothing a quit-and-reload or reboot couldn’t fix, but they did pop up enough times to warrant mentioning. The Mageseeker: A League of Legends story is another solid example of Riot Forge partnering with talented developers to bring League’s rich list of champions to life in new genres to showcase more sides of their characters. The story goes to some interesting places after a slow start, picking up steam in the second half and leading to a momentous finale. Levels are fairly straightforward and could have benefitted from additional content, like optional puzzles or bonus objectives, but the bosses and variety of abilities is enough to keep you on your toes despite some of the repetition.

Horizon Forbidden West: Burning Shores ,8,"It would have been relatively easy for Guerrilla Games to rest on their laurels and put out a Horizon expansion that was just more Forbidden West. And in some ways, the Burning Shores DLC is exactly that: a distilled helping of what made the core game so great – an elevated sci-fi story in a pulpy wrapping, tied with a bow made from high-octane action. You'll once again be fighting machines, solving puzzles, and yes, climbing tall structures. But Guerrilla has done much more here, adding in surprises with new machines to discover and introducing even more fun ways to take them down. Burning Shores is for the most part a great time, and clumsily engineered ending aside, a worthy addition to the Horizon series. After the conclusion of the main campaign, this DLC summons you to LA in order to hunt down a lead that may be helpful against the looming threat introduced at the end of Forbidden West's story. The titular Burning Shores are an archipelago roughly four times the size of the San Francisco area of the main map, and shares a lot of that region’s visual identity. It’s a smart decision to echo Forbidden West's standout location – the sand still sparkles and water glistens – but here lava flows in a natural representation of the increased danger that lurks in the Burning Shores. It wastes no time in throwing you into that danger, either, plunging you straight back into the rousing rhythms of Horizon combat.  At first, I found myself scrambling in the sand to rediscover half-buried techniques such as whipping into the air and slowing down time, but quickly got back in the zone, shifting styles like the tectonic plates sliding beneath me. Burning Shores doesn’t hang about when introducing new methods of machine destruction either, such as explosive crystals that cause ruins to collapse onto nearby enemies. Due to the clustered island nature of this new area, the level design tends to naturally create large, contained spaces that are perfect as action-filled arenas. The combat encounters that unfold within these spaces feel as accomplished as anything Guerrilla has created in the Horizon series yet, with a great variety of enemies paired together and environments filled with opportunity. A few new threats join the party to further enhance that mechanical menagerie, including the buzzing, flying ant-like Stingspawn and my favourite, the colossal, acid-spewing Bilegut: a leaping mecha-toad that is a terrific challenge to take down. An exciting new weapon is introduced to your arsenal to even the odds, too. I won't spoil what it is here, but it's a highly enjoyable and delightfully powerful addition that I quickly became reliant on in later battles. It's joined by fresh abilities added to the skill tree, some of which are fantastically effective and – crucially – fun to use. The grapple critical strike solves the formerly lingering problem of dispatching downed-but-distant enemies, and one of the new Valor Surge ultimate abilities causes gleeful chaos by sending surrounding machines into a berserker mode that forces them into a frenzy against one another. The depiction of the city itself is stunning and further reinforces Forbidden West as one of the very best-looking games out there. Some landmarks still stand, such as the crumbling husk of the Capitol Records Building where the only music being made these days is a clanging mashup of metal and electronic as machines whirr and crackle. The new surroundings aren't just lovely to look at but supply fun new gameplay quirks too. Fizzing geysers offer the chance to glide high into the air, making for an effective option in combat as you swoop over unsuspecting threats. Ballistas are used for their puzzle-solving abilities as much as their destructive ones as you create new paths in cliffs with their bolts. It's this smart deployment of equipment with multiple varying uses that serves as a further display of the clever level design (ending aside) on display here. The majority of the fights are a thrill, which makes it a deflating anticlimax when, in its big moments, Burning Shores falls a bit flat. An arrow-sponge boss battle midway through its five-hour story is a particular annoyance, for example. Then there's the huge-scale final encounter, where the clunky action just can't match the spectacle as you're bounced around the arena like a ragdoll while trying to find damage-dealing windows. A stuttering sin when compared to Horizon’s trademark fluid combat, it's a disappointing finale that feels at odds with most of Burning Shores' runtime. This is a fun adventure that ends with a clumsy thud both mechanically and in the story, which does fall foul of some of Horizon's sci-fi trappings. However, it never forgets to focus on the humanity of the situation, further fleshing out Aloy as an endearing and relatable character. The advancement of her character arc comes primarily thanks to the introduction of Seyka – someone similarly insular to Aloy – and the duo helps each other unlock themselves. Seyka proves a valuable companion not only in combat, but also by easing the plot burden from Aloy – crucially giving her someone to talk with and, mercifully, less time telling you about what she's putting in her stash. The returning Ashly Burch is as good as ever as Aloy, but special mention has to go out to Kylie Liya Page as Seyka, who does a fantastic job at creating an engaging and believable three-dimensional character in a relatively short amount of time. A triumphant combination of enthralling combat, top-tier creature and character design, and a captivating open world, Horizon Forbidden West is an absolute blast and fantastic showcase for the power of the PS5. Although the return of a couple of familiar series trappings and a noticeable lack of freeform climbing never threatens to derail the enjoyment, it does leave it falling frustratingly short of something revolutionary. Major evolutionary steps have firmly been placed in the right direction, however, and there’s no doubting the many, many hours of fun to have with Aloy, who stakes her claim further to be one of this generation of gaming’s greatest characters. Guerrilla has outdone itself yet again with Forbidden West, and at this trajectory, neither the horizon nor the sky's the limit for what could come next.<i> - Simon Cardy, February 14, 2022</i Read the full <a href=""/horizon-forbidden-west-1/53790/review/horizon-forbidden-west-review"">Horizon Forbidden West Review</a There are some great scenes between the two scattered throughout, both quiet and loud, with some highlights once again being when Horizon turns its lens towards our history through its old-world architecture. One area in particular is a delight as the amusement park-like veins that run through LA are re-exposed hundreds of years later. The two lead characters are cut from the same cloth – both outsiders who've learned to be part of a bigger whole – leading to a fun dynamic between the pair as they navigate the Burning Shores together. If Forbidden West was all about Aloy learning to work with others, then Burning Shores feasts on the fruits of those efforts thanks to her competitive, but gradually softening dynamic with Seyka. There will no doubt be discussions surrounding how their chapter together ends, but I felt it was largely in keeping with what we’ve learned about Aloy as a character over the series, even if this particular finish line does seem to have been rushed toward ever so slightly. Burning Shores is essentially one long side quest, which isn't necessarily a bad thing as similar diversions were some of Forbidden West's high points, but sometimes it does struggle to balance character development with feeling like a worthy bridge to the inevitable sequel. It does play stage for a new BioShock-flavoured villain who is a mustache-twiddle away from a cliché, and they don't really get enough screen time to come across as too significant a threat, but do manage to leave a charismatic mark on the story, nonetheless. Despite the villain’s slight impact, Burning Shores does ultimately feel like an essential chapter of Aloy’s story, just not necessarily one to the world of Horizon as a whole. Of course, there are side quests within this side quest, too. Each is often tied to personal stories of intrigue or anguish delivered by the once again solid supporting cast. As with the main game, there is a welcome amount of depth to be found in these with the character and costume design on show is once again best-in-class, with no detail spared. Horizon Forbidden West’s Burning Shores DLC is a worthwhile addition to this acclaimed action-heavy sci-fi series. Fun new challenges and enemies are introduced and cool new ways to dispatch them are presented with regularity. The story is more concerned with developing character than it is working towards dealing with the imminent world-ending threat, and it’s Aloy at her most personal and believable yet. A couple of poor boss battles aside, it’s a great new chapter with enough creative new bells and whistles to keep fans more than happy. "
Minecraft Legends ,7,"A good strategy game is ultimately one about choice. Which units to create, where to allocate resources, which strategies to implement. The right decisions lead to victory, while the wrong ones force you to adapt and adjust or else suffer bitter defeat. I found myself at the crossroads of these decisions time and again as I played Minecraft Legends, Mojang and Blackbird Interactive's simplified take on an action-RTS. It doesn’t always do a perfect job opening the door of this often intimidating genre to a wider audience, but the way it largely manages to streamline things without losing most of those important tactical moments is what makes Minecraft Legends work. Simplicity is one of Minecraft Legends greatest strengths. Evil Piglins from the Nether are invading, because that's what evil Piglins do, and it’s your job to build up the forces needed to drive them back. You’ll do that by exploring a procedurally generated continent for resources, allies, and secrets to discover, destroying Piglin bases and defending friendly settlements from the invaders as you do. There are no levels, and the minimalistic story is mostly just cutscenes announcing the arrival of larger Piglin forces. Once you’ve cleared all the Piglins out, victory is yours, and you can start another run from scratch on a brand new map.  Minecraft’s iconic blocky style has been well established across its many spin-offs and adaptations by now, but it's still extremely well implemented here. The entire world looks like it was pulled straight from the main Minecraft series, with landscapes, NPCs, and blocks of ore that are identical to their counterparts. It all looks great thanks to a vibrant color palette and some excellent lighting – as is Minecraft tradition, nights bring added danger from aggressive enemies, but it's hard to dread their arrival when it’s preceded by gorgeous sunsets over stunning vistas. Unlike Starcraft or Command and Conquer, where you occupy the seat of some far off overseer commanding a complex legion of forces from above that landscape, Legends puts on you the field of battle directly similar to the Overlord series, giving you control of a warrior fighting alongside a small squad of summonable units. There's a handful of interesting unit types, each with a very clear niche that they fill. Cobblestone Golems have a lot of health but aren’t great at dealing damage quickly, Plank Golems are the opposite, Mossy Golems heal, etc. The fact that it is so straightforward is great, as it makes it easy to jump right into the action without a steep learning curve or thick manual to memorize. The commands you give your soldiers tend to boil down to ""go kill things over there"" or ""follow me"" and are equally easy to issue whether you’re using a gamepad or mouse controls. That’s partly thanks to armies being made of dozens of units rather than hundreds, which keeps things manageable. It’s genuinely fun to smash the gate of a Piglin Fort and send in a horde of your own to run roughshod over everything in its path. There are some drawbacks to that simplicity, however. In theory, certain units work great as counters to specific enemies – Skeleton Archers, for example, should be the go-to choice for dealing damage to the massive flail-wielding Portal Guards from a distance. But abundant resources and the ability to instantly spawn forces sometimes makes it easier to just overwhelm enemies with pure numbers, taking a lot of the thought out of certain battles. It’s also disappointing that there’s no way to create battle groups of specific units – you can command all of a certain unit type at once, but not custom groups of mixed troops. It would have been great fun to be able to quickly issue orders to a squad of damage spongy zombies mixed with healing units to push the front line, supporting them with a group of archers protected by Plank Golems raining pain upon the Piglins. But that level of fine control isn’t really feasible, and that’s a shame. Fortunately, the fact that you participate directly in battles brings with it a chance to make some clever choices. As the hero, you are significantly more powerful than any individual soldier in your army, always mounted and armed with a sword that swings in wide arcs. This opens up opportunities to do things like create swarms of Cobblestone Golems for an invasion, then tell them to focus on destroying buildings while you protect them, or send units to guard one side of a friendly settlement while you cover the other. It’s the kind of mental push-pull that makes strategy games so much fun. This wouldn’t be a Minecraft game without gathering resources and building, and that’s translated in a slick and intuitive way. Allays are small fairy-like creatures that assist with these tasks – one type focuses on resource gathering, letting you point them at a grove of trees or a quarry filled with ore and strip the resources completely independently, while the other carries out building instructions, quickly assembling structures like golem spawners or arrow towers, provided the resources are available. It’s an exceptionally easy system to use that works in a very natural way, letting you go from idea to construction with just two button presses or mouse clicks. The Piglin army will attack a settlement most nights, with each new assault highlighted on the world map, but quickly assembling walls and gates to hold them back is a breeze thanks to those industrious Allays. Figuring out the best way to build each base is a lot of fun – adding structures like an Architect Hut to repair buildings or a Masonry to convert wooden defensive structures to stone is a constant drain on resources, but they can lead to a much more fortified town that’s better able to withstand the rampaging armies of the Nether. The choice of whether to forage for more resources to keep building or hunker down for the coming battle is compelling, and I relished each opportunity to make and execute a plan. The independent operation of your Allays feeds into the strategy elements of combat in interesting ways, too. I would often find myself defending a settlement from an invading force of Piglins and command walls be built as I fought. If wood supplies ran low, I would have to ride to a nearby forest and start the collection process, letting both sets of Allays work while I continued the fight. But Piglins will go out of their way to target the fragile Allays, keeping this mid-battle backup from being too overpowered by forcing me to think twice before leaving them unprotected. A structure called the Well of Fates acts as your primary home base. This is where you start, the default respawn location when you die, and where you do most of your upgrading. Destroyed Piglin structures drop Prismarine, which is used to construct upgrade structures that allow you to do things like command more troops or store more materials in general. There’s a limited number of places these can be built, and I found myself sweating the decisions about whether to increase the size of my army, open up opportunities to mine specialty ores like coal and redstone, or add more Allays to expedite resource gathering. The Piglins themselves don’t sit on their hands (hooves?) waiting for you to build up armies to come smash them, either. They produce bases and outposts of their own, with increasing complexity as time goes on. What begins as some quick pillaging of a few buildings at the start eventually becomes long sieges of intricate fortresses that can take multiple in-game days. Whether to press the advantage or turn your attention toward defending vulnerable areas elsewhere is a constant mental struggle that creates a nice sense of tension. Unfortunately, the difficulty curve has a few kinks in it. The last few hours of my 16-hour playthrough slowed to a crawl as enemies with massive amounts of health joined the fray, like the heavily armored Pigmadillos. It’s great that enemies with unique designs and attacks still continue to show up, but the size of the armies they fill becomes a slog. This is an even bigger problem when attacking an enemy base on a high plateau – assembling an attack force only to realize half of them fell off a cliff on the march up due to suspect pathfinding is frustrating. Legends loses some of its potential as an onboarding opportunity for the strategy genre because of these endgame struggles. There is a premium currency that can be purchased with real world money in Minecraft Legends. There will be cosmetic items and new “experiences” available, but nothing that affects the competitive multiplayer landscape or player progress. The experiences will be tied to either Lost Legends and Myths. Lost Legends are free, and represent monthly challenges for players that give as-of-yet undisclosed rewards upon completion. Myths, on the other hand, will be set up similar to the Minecraft Marketplace available in Minecraft Bedrock, where partnered creators earn revenue by creating paid experiences that players can opt into purchasing. Time will tell how well the system works, but on paper it’s fairly innocuous as far as microtransactions go. Fortunately, good construction options can mitigate some of those pain points. Siege tools like the Redstone Launcher, which acts somewhat like a long range cannon fixture, can help clear a landing point, and crafting bridges or stairs to cross gaps and ascend hills is a snap. The Cure Netherrack ability that slowly transforms the corrupted ground under Piglin bases is a standout difference maker, too, allowing the assembly of buildings and golem spawners inside enemy territory. These are fun ways to turn the tide, but it can be a little uncharacteristically daunting that making the most of every single tool in your belt feels like the only viable option to clear the highest level outposts. Minecraft Legends is fun solo, but it excels in multiplayer. The entire campaign can be played in co-op with up to three other friends, where resources are split but everyone has full autonomy to act independently. Dividing tasks like resource gathering, base building, and combat alleviates many frustrations, and it’s just a lot of fun to charge into battle with your allies. It’s the best way to play, and sharing the elation of victory with friends doesn’t get old. PVP, meanwhile, has an interesting wrinkle to it: two teams go head-to-head on a randomized map,  with players on each team controlling a hero while sharing resources and golems. Matchmade games are designed for 3v3 or 4v4, but private games can have any mix of up to four players on either side. One game my team worked to destroy Piglin bases early so we could afford upgrades quickly, focusing on making the most powerful army possible before clashing with other humans. Another game we were wiped out when our opponents stealthily built a Redstone Launcher within range of our base, focusing almost entirely on defending that while it crushed our structures. The strategic elements that other humans can bring are much more interesting than facing the CPU. Minecraft Legends is an engaging strategy game that does a great job streamlining a notoriously complex genre without sacrificing the ever-important element of choice and consequence. That said, some genre staples like assigning custom groups of units are casualties of this simplification, which is too bad because it does limit your strategic options a bit in the heat of battle. But Legends uses other recognizable elements like its worker unit Allays to great effect, and it nails the iconic Minecraft aesthetic with some of the best looking blocks around. The difficulty curve does have the potential to make the late game frustrating, but stellar cooperative and PVP play still make this RTS very worthwhile. "
Mighty Doom ,5,"Doom has been many things over the years — a <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-eternal-final-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">pioneering first-person shooter</a>, an <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/19/doom-rpg"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">RPG</a>, even a <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/06/quakecon-2016-20-images-from-the-awesome-new-doom-board-game"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">board game</a> — but Mighty Doom is the first time this franchise has been cute. Your cartoonish Slayer in this mobile top-down shooter is just as adorable as the chonky cacodemons and prowlers with pinchable cheeks he is mutilating. The whole thing starts out as a lively single-stick roguelite that has you marching through demon-packed levels toward… well, I’m not exactly sure. I never saw the end of it, because a hellish difficulty spike clearly designed to bully me into spending real money on in-game power Glory Killed any desire I had to keep playing. There’s a fun, fast-paced, delightfully gory game in here, but it’s chained to a mountain of free-to-play garbage that leaches the fun out of the experience once you reach a certain point. The result is a monetized nightmare that feels less like Doom and more like Candy Crush Saga with Hell Priests. You control your Doom Slayer using an onscreen joystick, but shooting is automatic. That means all you have to do is move around the arena-like stages avoiding enemies, projectiles, and environmental dangers like spikes and saw blades. You also have a couple of slots for special weapons, like a rocket launcher and BFG, that you can deploy with the press of a button after a cooldown period. The touchscreen controls aren’t super precise, which becomes a problem when the screen is filled with enemies and bullets later on, but they’re mostly adequate in earlier levels.  i>Doom isn't the first major game series to get a mobile port awash in distracting monetization recently, here's what we said about 2022's Diablo Immortal.</i There’s so much to like about Diablo Immortal that it really pains me to see it so close and yet so far from being a game I can heartily recommend. As a casual, purely free-to-play experience it offers a lot to do, with its empowering ARPG combat and interesting skill system, whereas for those that want to be competitive in PVP it quickly becomes restrictive, punitive, and money-grubbing. And for everyone in between? It just doesn’t offer good value for money spent. If the Empowered Battle Pass and Boon of Plenty offered more, I could definitely see myself renewing them each season and steadily working my way through the many difficulty levels as I ascend Immortal’s 600 paragon levels, and gradually – oh so gradually – ranking up my legendary gems. Instead, that dream is so far out of reach that it’s not feasible, and the further in I get the less the rewards offered by those paid services are actually likely to be meaningful. I’m still going to keep playing Diablo Immortal, but without overhauls to the monetisation and the many restrictions, it’s going to be a dip in, dip out game, as opposed to a world I want to live in. <i>- Cam Shea, June 1, 2022</i Read the full <a href=""/diablo-immortal/56815/review/diablo-immortal-review-in-progress"">Diablo Immortal review</a>. As a roguelite, you start each run with only the persistent gear you’ve equipped between levels, but you’ll earn lots of temporary upgrades as you slay demons mid-run to increase your combat capabilities. This is incredibly empowering, as toward the end of a run you might be double-firing spread-shot rounds that bounce off walls and ricochet from one enemy to the next, while lobbing grenades with upgraded splash damage. These upgrades go away at the end of each run, but they make Mighty Doom exciting and rewarding on a moment-by-moment basis. Most levels are made up of 40 stages roughly the size of tennis courts, with bosses to take down every 10. Bosses are big, souped-up versions of standard enemies like imps, soldiers, revenants, and prowlers, but they have their own unique attacks and patterns, so they feel fresh — at least the first few times you encounter them. The enemy variety in the levels mostly works well, too, with weaker pawn-like foes up front, sturdier tank enemies in the middle, and ranged opponents in the back. Your demon-slaying runs are accompanied by a heavy-metal soundtrack that sounds like it was pulled straight from recent Doom games, too, giving the whole thing a boost of intensity as the announcer growls the names of your upgrades in a delightfully over-the-top manner. Take all that together and I had a lot of fun in my first few hours with Mighty Doom. After one run, I always wanted to start another to see if I could get closer to beating whatever level I died on. During those early hours, I could make progress at a reasonable rate as well — I might die on a stage 10 boss, but I’d be able to make it several stages deeper the next time after upgrading my Slayer between runs. I was somewhere in level four when I hit a steep difficulty spike that halted my progress like a BFG blast to the chest. Two things happened: first, the enemies became noticeably more powerful, draining big chunks of my health with a single blow. On top of that, the number of enemies on screen in some levels increased to the point where it could be difficult to tell what was even happening. I’d find projectiles flying at me from all directions, pinkies and lost souls charging in from offscreen, and revenants dropping down to lob missiles at my face. I’d often see my health bar draining and have no idea what was even hitting me. After struggling to make any headway for a while, I spent $15 on in-app purchases to upgrade my equipment — both because it seemed like the only option I hadn’t tried to make progress, and because I wanted to see if my growing pay-to-win suspicions were correct. The boost that money provided did get me through level four, but not much further. Level five introduces waves of enemies, while also giving those enemies another enormous power boost. That’s when Mighty Doom started to feel downright unfair, and the emphasis it put on its purchasable loot boxes meant the difficulty struck me less as a balance miscalculation and more of an unspoken paywall. Whether you want to spend a whole lot of time throwing yourself against this frustrating and repetitive challenge or a whole lot of money to make it slightly more reasonable, you aren’t going to get past this point without jumping through even more free-to-play hoops. And Mighty Doom has free-to-play hoops <i>galore</i>. You have an avalanche of currencies to keep track of: unique keys for each equipment type (there are eight), energy, coins, and crystals, the last two of which can be purchased with real money. You have to spend five energy to start a run and you can only carry 20, which means you can’t always dive into another run when you want to. Your energy replenishes slowly over time, but of course you can speed it up by spending crystals. You can also spend crystals to buy loot boxes to increase your Slayer’s power, but the number of crystals required to open a loot box with a <i>chance</i> of containing a rare or epic item is steep. Each piece of gear can be upgraded dozens of times by spending coins and equipment keys, but individual improvements are barely noticeable. Coins can be used to upgrade a random core stat, or “mastery,” but after hitting the difficulty spike, those power boosts felt inadequate as well. Other monetization options include purchasing new Slayer skins and weapon skins, using either crystals or real money directly depending on the item. You can even spend crystals to revive your Slayer once mid-run. And, to get even <i>better</i> gear as you play, you can purchase a battle pass for $6.99. Basically, whatever aggravating monetization scheme you may have heard about in the last decade is probably here. The one alternative to spending in-game currency is spending your real-life time watching ads. You can watch an ad to avoid paying to revive (this is a limited privilege, I discovered). You can also watch an ad to open a very basic type of loot crate containing coins or common gear. And while you can earn the currencies just by playing, it’s never enough to make much of a difference after that level four difficulty spike. No matter what I did, I never had the currency needed to make progress at a reasonable pace unless I was willing to open my wallet. Trying to wrap my head around all the free-to-play junk surrounding the basic game felt like I was studying for the Bar Exam. I understand some of this monetization is necessary, or at least accepted as common practice for many mobile games these days, especially free ones. But buying skins or a battle pass in Fortnite or Marvel Snap feels different. Those games are centered around multiplayer, and showing off your favorite cosmetic upgrades at least seems to serve a purpose — plus they’re easy to ignore if that’s not your thing. Mighty Doom is a single-player game, so you don’t have anyone to impress with your new Slayer skins except yourself. And paying for power upgrades to complete a level you’re stuck on due to an artificially punishing difficulty spike is the very definition of pay-to-win. There is a devilishly fun roguelite hiding in Mighty Doom, but the way it’s been buried under all the most egregious money-making schemes in mobile gaming is hugely disappointing. I enjoyed the first few hours, when monsters posed an entertaining challenge I could satisfyingly overcome, and I would probably be happy to recommend it if Bethesda had balanced all nine levels to match. But it’s not long before a super-powered difficulty spike meant my Slayer’s defense and damage output just couldn’t keep up — at least, not without opening my wallet. Even when you do, this invisible paywall and the free-to-play speed bumps that accompany it turn Mighty Doom into a teeth-grindingly frustrating experience that made me want to delete the app entirely rather than pay to upgrade my Slayer enough to progress.

sident Evil 4 ,10,"In light of the high-quality remakes of <a href=""/resident-evil-2-1"">Resident Evil 2</a> and <a href=""/resident-evil-3-1"">3</a> released in 2019 and 2020, it felt like a safe bet that Capcom would do an equally admirable job of rebuilding Resident Evil 4. Even so, when I hit the start button on this 2023 remake of the legendary 2005 action-horror game I wasn’t prepared for how forcefully it would knock my knees out from under me and suplex me headfirst into 16 hours of sustained tension and exhilaration. This fully revitalised campaign dramatically one-ups the original in almost every conceivable way. Its Spanish countryside setting is substantially more sinister, its pacing has been tightened to the point where hardly a single minute is wasted, and its controls have been modernised in order to allow its signature dynamic shooting mechanics to really shine. I’ve been waiting 18 years for a game to thrill me in the same way as Resident Evil 4; as it turns out, this whole time I’ve just been waiting for another Resident Evil 4. The original Resident Evil 4 is a landmark installment in Capcom’s seminal survival-horror series that, for many, would need no introduction. However, considering it came out back when we assumed that Episode III would be the last Star Wars film and iPhones didn’t even exist yet, I should probably give it some context. At the time it was a big deal for Resident Evil to switch from the series’ traditional fixed-camera perspectives to a then radical over-the-shoulder viewpoint that brought us uncomfortably close to the gore and put the emphasis on reflexes and precision targeting, and as a result Resident Evil 4 was an action-horror epic without peer. Its influence has subsequently been felt in countless other third-person classics like <a href=""/gears-of-war-25"">Gears of War</a>, <a href=""/dead-space-2008"">Dead Space</a>, and <a href=""/the-last-of-us"">The Last of Us</a>, and now its original DNA has been extracted, synthesised, and injected into a state-of-the-art host game, mutating it into a menacing new monster that's breathtaking to behold and immensely intimidating to encounter.  In preparation for this review I returned to the original game for the first time in years and was shocked at how badly this remake was needed. The movement of main star Leon Kennedy felt ridiculously restricted; he struggles to get around as though he’s wearing an old pair of skinny jeans that haven’t fit him since his police academy days, and is immobilised anytime he gets his gun out as though he’s incapable of independent control over his hands and feet at the same time. By modern standards it’s absurd, and would absolutely put off a lot of newcomers before they could begin to understand why this game is so highly regarded. Thankfully, those days are gone. Not unlike the recent <a href=""/metroid-prime-remastered"">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>, this Resident Evil 4 remake plays like a 2023 game. Luxuries like simultaneous twin-stick movement and targeting mean that you can cautiously back away while still keeping your gun trained on the advancing hordes, or side-step out of the way of an incoming crossbow bolt without having to remove your eye from the scope of your rifle. This newfound freedom of movement makes you better equipped to really make the most of the immensely satisfying area-specific damage effects; blowing kneecaps out to expose an enemy to a melee finisher, blasting sticks of dynamite held in the hands of attackers before they have a chance to throw them, or simply reveling in some of the grisliest headshots in the history of video game shotguns. None of this will shock you if you never played the original, but trust me, it’s a big deal to those of us who are back for round two: the rough edges of a number of other interactions have been filed down, like how crates and barrels can be quickly smashed at the tap of a button rather than having to clumsily line up a knife swing, making it much faster to scramble for ammo and health pickups in the heat of a battle. Weapon switching is now performed instantly with a tap of the D-pad rather than having to pause to hop in and out of the inventory screen, and Leon’s combat knife can also be used to parry enemy attacks or bring a swift finish to staggered foes, or to take enemies out silently after he’s crept up on them with his new ability to crouch. (It must be those looser fitting jeans).  Crucially, though, this overhauled control setup makes combat more enjoyably fluid without compromising any of the challenge when played on the Hardcore setting recommended for returning players. (‘Standard’ and ‘Assisted’ modes are included if you want an easier time of it.) The added benefits of the knife are balanced by the fact that it takes damage with each use, so you can only rely on it sparingly – otherwise it will break like a tiny Master Sword and must be repaired at a merchant before you can resume stabbing. Meanwhile, enemies move in dangerously erratic ways and have a tendency to quickly overwhelm in numbers, so you still have to make snap decisions when it comes to prioritising targets. They’ve also learnt a few cunning new tricks to trip you up with, like the sneaky way the homicidal villagers will lay down bear traps in the middle of a fight to keep you on your toes while you’re busy flexing your trigger finger. Resident Evil 4 may well give you a more expansive toolset to aid Leon’s survival, but you still need to keep your wits and reflexes sharp – because losing your head amidst a crowd crawling with a murderous mind-controlling parasite can swiftly result in Leon literally losing his. Thankfully, a new checkpoint save system minimises any arduous backtracking from your last manual typewriter save should Leon perish – but purists should take note that the unlockable Professional difficulty mode removes that safety net if you prefer a more punishing run the next time through. iframe allow=""autoplay; fullscreen *"" allowautoplay="""" allowfullscreen=""true"" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/resident-evil-4-remake/65186/gallery/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery65186"" scrolling=""no""></iframe No matter what difficulty you choose, a major strength of Resident Evil 4 is that enemy types are continually shuffled so that you can never really settle into a one-size fits all strategy. Just as you’re comfortably pulling off headshots, they start wearing helmets to force you to target their legs. Then, once you’ve busted more kneecaps than a debt collector, they start coming back to life with deadly whipping tendrils sprouting out of their shoulders. Then, when you’ve figured out how to take out these terrifying mutations efficiently, you come face to face with a seemingly unstoppable waddling tub of nightmare fuel that can regenerate every blown off body part like a T-1000 that was hand-sculpted by Clive Barker. Resident Evil 4 gives you a growing number of guns that all feel great to use, from submachine guns to rocket launchers and the especially powerful magnums, and does its absolute best to ensure you’re leaving very little in the chamber after each frenzied firefight. I also love how the tactile nature of almost every element in your surroundings can be used as a tactical advantage, provided you can think fast enough on your feet. The chainsaw attacks from the terrifying, sack-hooded Dr. Salvador are just as deadly to Leon as they are to every other enemy in the vicinity, so baiting him into lunging at you and then steering him into a crowd of his own minions is a great way to thin the herd. Meanwhile, dangling oil lanterns can be shot and dropped onto an angry mob to set them all ablaze, but they can also be used to ignite hapless animals like cows who will rage out of control and scorch everyone in their path. When ammunition is always at a premium, it’s both practical and ridiculously entertaining to let a flaming hunk of hamburger do your dirty work. Many of you under 30 might have no clue what Resident Evil 4 is about: it’s perhaps best described as riding a rollercoaster that’s careening off the rails to crash through a row of spectacular haunted houses. What starts as a fairly straightforward rescue mission, with Leon sent into a small Spanish village in search of the US President’s missing daughter Ashley, soon hurtles into a heart-stopping series of battles against giant sea monsters and towering trolls, desperate defenses against crazed hordes in boarded up cabins, outrageous assaults on a heavily fortified castle, skulking sections through shadowy laboratories, explosive minecart chases, and countless run-ins with some truly twisted freaks infected with the mutating Las Plagas parasite, all of which look consistently incredible reimagined on Capcom’s RE Engine (which also powered the last two remakes). The original RE4’s famously flabby final third has been tightened up considerably, and it all builds towards an improved and genuinely imposing final boss fight that took all of my skill and ammo reserves to topple. Of equal importance to its renovated environments and enemies is the anxiety-inducing audio design. It can’t be overstated how effective the sounds of Resident Evil 4 are when it comes to cultivating a genuine sense of dread. Whether it’s the manic chanting of its parasite-riddled peasant farmers when you enter a new area, the snarl of wolves as they whip through the leaves around you in the castle’s hedge maze, or the throaty rumble of a chainsaw motor idling in the distance, just listening to it all routinely had me inching towards the edge of my seat in anticipation for each enemy encounter, so when the the carnage kicked off and the tension spiked I had hardly any couch left to cling to. At every step of the journey there are enhancements, both big and small. The original’s gimmicky, quicktime-event-heavy knife battle against Major Krauser has been transformed into a gripping blend of parries and counter-attacks, while the frustration of escorting Ashley through certain sections has been reduced significantly by ditching her health bar so you don’t need to waste valuable green herbs on healing her, and her intelligence has been improved so she’s less prone to foolishly stumble into the hands of a bloodthirsty mob. Elsewhere, there have been considerable structural changes that make the environment feel more cohesive. For instance, in the original game the lake area primarily served as the backdrop to a boss fight, but now you can fully explore the lake and its surroundings by boat, docking at various inlets to scour cabins and caves for additional puzzles, valuable treasures, and hidden horrors lying in wait. With Resident Evil 4, Capcom has successfully – triumphantly – taken the franchise to the next level. It's really emphasized the ""survival"" in survival horror, too. You're oftentimes on the run for your life. And villagers, much smarter than any zombie, team up, dodge bullets, and do other nasty things that I will let you discover on your own. Then there are the boss fights, which are unexpectedly brilliant. This game is extremely scary, and that fear is intensified by the best graphics and some of the most eerie audio on Nintendo's console. When you add in the new camera and action systems, as well as Leon's excellent new analog targeting function, you have a completely transformed survival horror experience. One that eclipses everything before it. Indeed, even after 20-plus hours of non-stop thrills, you won't want to put the controller down. – <i>Matt Casamassina, January 7, 2005</i a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/01/07/resident-evil-4-7"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Read the full Resident Evil 4 (2005) review</a In fact, despite having played the original several times over, there still seemed to be something that surprised me around each and every corner, and the pacing of Leon’s plight never gets bogged down in the sort of storytime stroll that’s become so common in a lot of big-budget single-player adventures. With all due respect to the likes of <a href=""/the-last-of-us"">The Last of Us</a> and <a href=""/god-of-war-ragnarok"">God of War Ragnarok</a> – which are both excellent in their own ways – Resident Evil 4 has no time for dialogue-heavy deep and meaningfuls. Leon’s foppish haircut might scream noughties emo but his stoic attitude is all-out ‘80s action hero, and no matter how much I had to Tetris-swap the expanding selection of guns and ammo to fit his inventory case he always seemed to have plenty of room left up his sleeve for a winking one-liner to whip out after a thoroughly insane action sequence before sliding a fresh clip into his submachine gun and running headlong into the next. When you do need to take a breather, the mysterious merchant returns to keep Leon topped up with a suite of dangerous devices like a quaint form of Q Branch, along with new recipes that allow you to craft the exact ammo types you want when out in the world rather than having to rely on randomised drops. He also pays the bounties on the optional side quests that have been added throughout the campaign, like shooting down hidden blue medallions or tracking down a rare golden chicken egg, which proved to be fun little diversions away from the story’s murderous main path. These bounties are paid in spinel gemstones which can be traded for unique items and upgrades outside of his standard inventory of wares, so although I was initially sad to see the iconic red dot sight removed from Leon’s starting pistol, it only took me a few short quests to be able to buy one and satisfyingly fit it myself. One thing in particular that I appreciate about the remake’s merchant is that he’s a lot more generous when it comes to the trade-in value of your weapons. In the original it never really made sense to invest too heavily in upgrading the base pistol and shotgun early on, only for their value to drop dramatically when it came time to trade up for some beefier boomsticks. However, in the remake you’re effectively refunded close to the full value of each weapon along with the cost of any upgrades you’ve added to it, so you can re-spec your favourite guns and boost them towards their optimal forms without copping as big a penalty to your purse of Spanish pesetas. The merchant also gives you access to the new bolt thrower weapon during your first encounter, and its reusable bolts come in handy in the story’s early hours when you’re still finding your feet as far as managing ammunition reserves and crafting resources goes. Yet despite his generous prices and fabulous wares, I couldn’t help but feel a little shortchanged after each transaction; his re-recorded dialogue isn’t delivered with quite the same kind of goofy charm as that of the grizzled original. However, in the scheme of things it says a lot for the overall quality of this remake when the only minor black mark I can give it is for its slightly blander black market dealer – and if this is your first time playing it won’t bother you in the slightest. It’s also a shame that The Mercenaries mode isn’t included at launch, although it’s reassuring to know that it will be coming as part of a free update sometime in the future, and I’m extremely keen to tackle its frantic time attack challenges with the benefits of Leon’s more malleable move set. In the meantime there’s a New Game+ mode and a lengthy list of in-game challenges to complete in order to unlock additional weapons, costumes, and concept art, though it seems that bonus modes Assignment Ada and Separate Ways that were present in older versions of Resident Evil 4 have either been scrapped or potentially saved for DLC. Their loss isn’t that big of a deal since they were never as huge a draw as The Mercenaries for me personally, but when a campaign is consistently this amazing, it’s hard not to feel greedy for a little bit more. Whether you're a fan of the original or a newcomer with a hankering for some action-heavy horror of the highest quality, Resident Evil 4 is like a parasite-riddled Spaniard: a total no-brainer. Its combat is friction-free but no less stress-inducing thanks to its ferocious cast of creatures, its story rapidly shuttles through a series of action scenes that are diverse in structure but uniformly unwavering in intensity, and its world is rich in detail and full of fun and often snarling surprises. Its improvements over the original are too numerous to list, from simple quality of life changes to completely overhauled boss fight mechanics, and with the exception of the disappointingly diminished personality of the merchant, the team at Capcom has barely put a foot wrong. Whaddaya buying? Only the most relentlessly exciting Resident Evil adventure of all time that’s been rebuilt, refined, and realised to the full limits of its enormous potential. A wise choice, mate.

Destiny 2: Lightfall Review in Progress,6,"On the chitin-covered heels of the impressive <a href=""/destiny-2/54570/review/destiny-2-the-witch-queen-review""><u>Witch Queen expansion</u></a> and a relatively strong year of live-service support overall, it seemed like Destiny 2 was finally gaining momentum as it headed toward the conclusion of its epic saga. Sadly, my optimism for a game I’ve spent thousands of hours playing has come crashing down like a Cabal drop pod after just a couple dozen with Destiny’s latest expansion, Lightfall. The story is so shockingly incoherent that even someone who has spent countless hours reading Destiny’s lore like I have couldn’t understand its nonsense, the new destination on Neptune feels as lifeless as the real planet, and the endgame/seasonal activities have so few surprises to offer (at least so far) that they give me deja vu in the worst possible way. Thankfully, a number of Lightfall’s activities are challenging enough to warrant me leaning forward in my seat, the new Strand subclass is a nice addition to Destiny’s sandbox, and the most recent batch of quality-of-life improvements largely succeed at making my time shooting space rhinos in the face a less bumpy ride. I still have a little more to do and the eventual raid ahead of me, but so far even Lightfall’s best parts haven’t been able to wash the overwhelming taste of disappointment out of my mouth. The opening moments of Lightfall are some of its best, as Destiny’s long-awaited final villain, The Witness, arrives in our solar system to deal a blow against humanity and our allies. But any excitement is quickly swept into the vacuum of space as you’re bizarrely and inexplicably redirected from the action to take part in a seemingly unrelated sidequest in the Neptunian city of Neomuna. Not only is the story a decidedly low stakes diversion that draws you away from the real conflict happening on Earth, but it flatout does not make sense. That’s not just me saying that, either; some of the Destiny community’s greatest lore minds have been <a href=""/destiny-2-lightfall/64760/news/destiny-2-lightfalls-launch-has-fans-polarized-amid-negative-reviews""><u>completely stumped</u></a> by the utter nonsense of Lightfalls’s story.  Lightfall also launches alongside some seasonal content for the Season of Defiance, which takes place in the aftermath of the events of Lightfall as humanity defends Earth from the ongoing invasion and has you running around with Mara Sav doing chores for her. Season of Defiance isn’t a part of Lightfall, but is being bundled with most versions of the expansion and so warrants limited consideration for this review. From what I’ve seen so far, this content is very much in line with what we’ve seen before and won’t likely move the needle for me either way. We’ve got a weekly ritual, a 3-person activity to grind out, and some new weapons and armor to play with, but no major surprises beyond that. As this season will take place over the course of the next few months, it remains to be seen if any curveballs will be thrown our way, but I certainly wouldn’t hold my breath. The events on Neomuna surround a macguffin called The Veil, a mysterious artifact that you’re told is super important, but nobody ever, <i><strong>ever</strong></i> tells you what it is or its purpose, even a little bit – ever. Your enemy is Calus, a stack of pancakes cosplaying as an air fryer, who serves as the least intimidating antagonist in Destiny’s history. As you wage war against an incompetent moron for control of an artifact you know nothing about, you’ll also discover the dark powers of Strand, a green elemental subclass our heroes spend half of the campaign trying to figure out how to use in a process so dull they literally skip over some of it by giving you a Rocky-style training montage at one point. Yikes. Along the way, you also meet the Cloud Striders, Nimbus and Rohan, who are 12-foot tall cybernetically infused humanoids with personalities that were apparently drawn randomly from a basket of cliches. Rohan is an elderly Cloud Strider who all-but stares directly into the camera to tell you he’s a day away from retirement (I wonder what will happen to him), while Nimbus is a young surfer dude who makes cringey jokes as humanity’s holocaust unfolds. Staying on brand with the rest of the campaign, the writing for these two is so extraordinarily bad it makes interacting with them a painful chore, especially Nimbus, who manages to make the low stakes of Lightfall’s story feel even more laughable with their irritating adolescent hijinks. Just as quickly as it began, the story wraps up a mere 8 hours later while resolving none of its greater questions and kicking the can down the road for any actual story developments to be dealt with at a later date, neatly putting all the pieces back exactly where they were at the beginning. The storytelling is so dreadful it makes me nostalgic for the days of the infamous “I don’t have time to explain why I don’t have time to explain” line uttered in vanilla Destiny – but worse than that, it undermines the approaching finale by trivializing the arrival of The Witness and slamming the brakes on any momentum or goodwill Destiny gained from The Witch Queen’s excellent writing. As a longtime Destiny fan, I was utterly heartbroken by both the disappointing whiplash in quality and all the wasted story potential by the time I finished Lightfall’s campaign. It’s not just the plot that disappoints, either. The levels themselves feel decidedly less unique or memorable than The Witch Queen. The interesting puzzles and diet raid mechanics featured in last year’s campaign have been replaced with irritating battles taking place in an arena where you’re often running in circles to survive, stopping to take shots here and there while you can. Instead of fighting interesting new enemies like the light-bearing Hive, Lightfall has you mostly fighting the same burly Cabal that we’ve been at war with for nine years, which have always been one of Destiny’s less engaging adversaries. Strand does at least help ease the monotony of the campaign’s action, representing the biggest shakeup to Destiny’s sandbox in a long while. The powers themselves aren’t revolutionary to Destiny: you get a new melee ability, new supers for each class that deal huge DPS, and some new buffs and debuffs to play with – like Suspend, which lifts enemies off the ground and entangles them briefly, or Sever, which causes the enemy’s damage output to become significantly reduced. Admittedly, these additions aren’t hugely different from what we’ve seen in Destiny over the years. For example, Suspend effectively does the same thing as the freezing powers of Stasis that we got with Beyond Light. And casting Strand supers to take out large groups of enemies works more-or-less identically to other subclasses but with a different color. But that’s not to say Strand has nothing unique to offer! The main reason to pick it over other classes is in its unmatched mobility, since the subclass replaces your Guardian’s grenade with a grapple hook that allows you to swing around the environment and pull yourself towards enemies to follow up with a devastating melee hit – both of which are a lot of fun. It’s definitely an interesting tradeoff since gaining access to a grapple hook is rarely worth losing a grenade over, but it still adds some much-needed diversity to the sandbox and is a great option to help navigate the vertical nature of Neomuna’s skyscrapers. You’ll be spending most of your time on the neon-soaked streets of Neomuna, a city that’s been peculiarly hidden from the rest of the galaxy until now, yet houses massive buildings and technology that surpasses even that of Guardians during the golden age. Unfortunately, this setting is as flimsy as its lore, and is barren and lifeless despite supposedly thriving up until the recent Cabal invasion. Each area of Neomuna contains a handful of featureless buildings and plenty of Cabal and Vex enemies to battle, but little else to engage with aside from the standard fare of patrols and public events that we’ve seen in every Destiny location since 2014. You might be thinking: “but shouldn’t this thriving city on Neptune be full of people to talk to?” Of course it should, right? It’d be crazy to make the whole thing look like a derelict corporate park with no intelligent life in sight. Well, as you’re conveniently told early in your visit, all of Neomuna’s citizens have been uploaded to a virtual network to achieve immortality, so they only appear around the city as blurry, ghostlike outlines. The only physical beings occupying the meat space of Neomuna are our duo of Cloud Striders, who apparently follow the Sith’s rule of two so there’s no chance of you meeting a third, maybe more interesting character even by accident. Luckily there’s at least one exciting new enemy for you to fight along the way, as Lightfall introduces the Tormentor, a warrior of the darkness who chases you around with a scythe, takes away your abilities with suppression powers, and can nearly one-shot you with his terrifying grapple attack. As the first true footsoldier of the darkness we’ve faced after years of speculation that their pyramid ships would be filled with new horrors for us to confront, the Tormentor serves as a glimmer of hope for what I imagine will be a fully realized enemy faction once we finally face The Witness head-on. But for now they’re one of the only things to occasionally inject some desperately needed freshness into Lightfall’s otherwise stale sandbox. They may be a bit overused in the campaign for that reason, but they are at least a genuinely fun new obstacle to overcome. A less thrilling addition is that Cabal enemies, now infused with the wicked powers of darkness, will frequently drop a shard upon death that grants an overshield to their allies for a long time unless it’s destroyed. While it’s at least a new challenge to contend with, it mostly just causes the flow of combat to grind to a halt every couple of seconds as you’re forced to remove overshields from the enemy before proceeding, only for another shard to drop the next time you kill something. Much of Destiny’s moment-to-moment gameplay remains unchanged with Lightfall, and five years into this sequel that’s a growing problem. If you look at some of my older reviews of Destiny 2’s expansions <a href=""/destiny-2-shadowkeep/29889/review/destiny-2-shadowkeep-review""><u>like Shadowkeep</u></a>, you might be confused why I called that underwhelming expansion “Good,” while being much more critical about this one. The main reason is that games (and my reviews of them) don’t exist without context – not only are many video games getting more impressive, Destiny specifically has raised the bar on itself over the years, especially with The Witch Queen. What was novel in 2019 has become tiresome four years on, and at this point Destiny’s predictable formula feels worse by its refusal to evolve (or in Lightfall’s case: its insistence on regressing). So while an expansion that’s probably worse than Lightfall by today’s standards genuinely felt good to me several years ago, an expansion that’s similarly disappointing feels downright gut-wrenching in 2023. Once you’ve completed Lightfall’s campaign, you’ll be greeted by the usual post-game quests and busywork that have followed all of Destiny’s recent campaigns. There’s nothing bad about the postgame stuff I’ve played so far, but there’s also nothing super exciting about it. You’ll learn a little more about Neomuna and go on an odyssey to obtain a new exotic weapon, or maybe even grind out some more customization options for the Strand subclass, but nothing I’ve played has made me particularly motivated about continuing to traipse around Neptune. I still have some quests to check off my list before finalizing this review, and am hopeful the raid that debuts on March 10 will prove more entertaining than the rest of my adventure so far. But as of right now, things are looking pretty dire for a game that’s been close to my heart for many years. No doubt Lightfall’s shortcomings are made more painful by immediately following The Witch Queen and its strong post-launch updates, which felt like Destiny 2 had finally overcome its storytelling woes and charted out a strong future for itself. After playing Lightfall, perhaps too fittingly given its name, that future doesn’t look quite as bright.  Destiny 2: Lightfall is a disappointing expansion with a campaign that falls flat on its face, an underwhelming new destination, and only a few new standout activities to take on. That said, Strand and the new Tormentor enemy are fantastic new additions to the sandbox, some of the endgame activities and added difficulty make for a sweaty, memorable time, and per usual, the raid is a complete blast (even if it isn’t their best). No doubt Lightfall’s shortcomings are made more painful by immediately following The Witch Queen and its strong post-launch updates, which felt like Destiny 2 had finally overcome its storytelling woes and charted out a promising future for itself. After playing Lightfall, perhaps too fittingly given its name, that future doesn’t look quite as bright. "
Sons of the Forest Early Access ,8,"I'll never forget my first confusing, terrifying encounter with a cannibal in 2018's The Forest, when an intelligent creature out of a nightmare decided simply to watch me rather than try to kill me. And while its sequel, Sons of the Forest, can't truly replicate the creepy novelty of that first time, it does build upon the gameplay, story, and atmosphere of one of the best ever survival crafting games in some very satisfying ways. It occasionally reminded me of its Early Access status with seemingly unfinished cutscenes and inconsistent performance, but not nearly as often as a lot of other recent games that use that label. Set several years after The Forest, Sons of the Forest challenges you to survive and uncover new mysteries on a lush, temperate island that reminded me of hiking in the American Pacific Northwest. It's about four times the size of the original's map, and it is downright gorgeous. The amount and variety of vegetation, some of which can be used as a food source or to make medicines, adds a fullness and richness to the landscape that we rarely see in this type of game. The lighting is also incredible. Clouds that partially block out the sun on a warm day completely change the mood of my exploration. It's one of those small details that most games ignore, but when one of them gets it right, I really notice.  I’ve never been terrorized, stalked, or fascinated by enemy AI quite like I was in The Forest. It’s a harrowing survival ordeal that knows how to play with tension and create the sense of a real world with complex inner workings and mysteries I was eager to discover. It’s I Am Legend told in the depths of the hinterlands, with a meaningful story progression that doesn’t overstay its welcome. Disregard the warnings on the walls and hidden between the trees at your own peril – and if you want a unique and memorable survival horror experience, then you should absolutely dare to do so. - <i>Leana Hafer, May 10, 2018</i Read our full <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/10/the-forest-review-2"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Forest review</a>. It isn't perfectly optimized yet though. While my RTX 3080 could generally cruise along at a smooth 60 frames or better at 1080p with DLSS set to maximum quality, I did run into semi-regular dips into the 20s when traveling long distances over land. And you sometimes see annoying pop-in with leaves and rocks appearing a couple dozen meters in front of you, which can really take me out of the experience. I also had a lot of glitchy sound issues, particularly during rainstorms or other times when a lot of different sounds were playing at once. Performance is usually one of the last things to be finalized, though, so hopefully a lot of this can be worked out over the course of Early Access. Further adding to the believability and hostility of the environment in Sons of the Forest is a full system of seasons, including snowy winters that kill off most of the edible vegetation and require you to keep track of your body temperature. It's a nice change of pace, but I think there's more that could be done with these weather effects. Being soaking wet and freezing cold, even on higher difficulties, is more of a small annoyance than a life-threatening challenge. And, hilariously, you can't break the ice on frozen bodies of water, even using C4 explosives. But overall, I enjoyed both the visual variety and shift in difficulty seasons provided quite a bit. Of course, I haven't mentioned the cannibals yet. Much like in the first game, they cleverly subvert everything we've been taught about video game enemies, prioritizing self-preservation over aggression. Every run-in with these bone-clad baddies begins with a tense stand-off, and many will choose not to fight, especially if they're alone and you don't act afraid of them. Their AI has definitely gotten a significant upgrade since The Forest, with improved stealth, more advanced social dynamics, and more varied group behavior. They can climb trees to get away or pounce on you from above, and even set ambushes, disguising themselves in piles of leaves. It's terrifying, especially if you're caught outside at night and you can hear that they're nearby, but you don't know where. I'll let you discover some of the more interesting interactions you can have with these fine folks on your own. Suffice to say, every time I thought they were out of surprises, they surprised me again. When you venture into the depths of the island, though, cannibals will be the least of your worries. There are a lot more hulking, horrible mutants in Sons of the Forest than there were in its prequel, and they're a lot more dangerous. I really came to enjoy the stronger focus on combat, as it's used very effectively to build tension rather than just to check a box or provide cheap thrills. Every fight with a powerful opponent or a large group of enemies is a heart-thumping resource management puzzle that reminded me of some of the best parts of Resident Evil or The Last of Us. Ranged weapons keep you out of danger, but ammo can be very difficult to come by. In melee, it's almost impossible to win without taking some amount of damage, which depletes your breakable armor pieces and healing items. And without batteries for your flashlight, you're as good as dead. I'd rather run out of bullets and food nine times out of 10 than lose my light source deep into a cavern run. So I found myself having to carefully consider the risks and rewards of each approach. Is losing a handful of arrows worth the loot I'll get from this cannibal camp? Is it worth the medicine I'll have to use to patch myself up if I go at this mutant with my axe to conserve ammo? The fighting itself also feels precise and responsive, so I never felt like I was robbed of my resources due to a bad hitbox or sluggish animations. Even if you played The Forest, and you know how far some of the later chapters stray from a stroll in the woods, I can fairly confidently say you still would never guess where Sons of the Forest is going to take you before the credits roll. And if you didn't play the first one, well… buckle up, I guess. The terrifying tale that begins with trying to find a billionaire and his family who went missing in the wilderness expands on the supernatural elements established in the first game – not always in ways that I enjoyed, but it certainly never got boring. The ending is both mind-blowing and, currently, pretty rough around the edges. I'm not going to show any of it here, but it's one of the few places I could really tell I was playing an Early Access game, with what seems like quite a bit of missing dialogue and some glitchy character interactions. In fact, I'd probably recommend you hold off on completing the story until it's in a more polished state, since there's so much else to do in the meantime. And that includes building your dream cannibal-proof fortress with a new, totally modular building system that lets you place individual structure elements like windows and support beams wherever you want. I spent a good five or six of my 25 hours so far just setting up a base, and I really barely scratched the surface of what is now possible. Especially if you have a full, eight-person crew in multiplayer. Which, by the way, has been running great for me so far, with no significant server issues. Sons of the Forest takes everything its predecessor did well and does it a little bit better. And considering how much I enjoyed the original, I can easily recommend this strong follow-up. Exploring a huge, beautiful, deadly island through the changing seasons is a treat on its own. The new base building mechanics could entertain me for days without ever touching the main story. And to top it all off, we have smarter and more unsettling enemy behavior paired with thoughtfully improved combat. It's already great, and it's still in Early Access. With some healthy performance optimization and shining up of an impactful but sloppy ending, it could become incredible. "
Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty ,8,"At this point, it’s probably fair to say that Team Ninja has a pretty good handle on this whole soulslike genre thing. Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty may not reach the same heights as Nioh 2 did back in 2020, but it certainly scratches that same itch of lightning-fast combat, punishing-yet-rewarding difficulty, and deep build customization options that you can craft and tailor to your own playstyle. It’s great for the same reasons that the Nioh games are, and it accomplishes that feat even while completely changing up the fundamentals of its combat system to be closer to Sekiro than Dark Souls. But by that same token, it also falls victim to the same familiar issues nagging at those other Team Ninja soulslikes, including subpar storytelling and excessively fiddly loot mechanics. But when you consider that the things Wo Long does better than just about any other game in this genre, that baggage amounts to scratches on an otherwise pristine set of armor. If you’re familiar with the Three Kingdoms era of Chinese history you may get more out of Wo Long’s story than I did (my knowledge basically begins and ends with the fact that you should not pursue Lu Bu), but I think even then it won’t be a highlight because Team Ninja continues to struggle with telling a memorable story with likable characters. This is a supernatural take on the final days of the Han Dynasty, where we take control of a nameless warrior who gets swept up in a power struggle between warring kingdoms and their pursuit of an elixir of immortality. In practically every level you team up with some sort of historically significant warrior to fight through a level, have a boss battle against an evil or corrupted historically significant warrior, and then move on to the next one.  Characters are introduced at a rapid-fire pace and leave the scene just as quickly, often without making any sort of impact on the overall story. Sometimes they return many hours later, but I’d already forgotten them because they didn’t do anything meaningful. Fortunately, the actual gameplay in between the cutscenes make up the vast majority of what we’re here to do, and it’s there that Wo Long shines brightest. Wo Long’s combat is a puzzle that needs to be figured out really quickly if you plan on getting past even the first major boss, but once you solve it, it’s incredibly satisfying to play around in. Similar to Sekiro, it’s a system that relies a lot on carefully timing deflections so you can preserve your Spirit meter while also avoiding damage, especially when enemies also start mixing in powerful, unblockable attacks that have to be parried rather than blocked. Crucially, though, you can completely negate damage from regular attacks just by holding down the block button, so long as you have enough Spirit built up to avoid having your guard broken – if that happens, you’re left helpless. You can even hold down the block button while also attempting to deflect, making it so that even if you’re too late on the deflection timing, you’ll still block the attack. It’s a good thing that Wo Long has this leniency built in because in practically every other regard, it doesn’t pull any punches. Enemies will regularly power through your attacks to deal a more powerful blow of their own, they have combos that go on for days, and they do a really good job at varying the rhythm of their attacks to try and bait you into parrying too early. It rewards a careful eye and punishes falling into a predictable rhythm. Even with all of that it isn’t nearly as hard as Nioh 2, for reasons I’ll get to later, but it still manages to find a really satisfying balance of being tough, fair, and absolutely exhilarating once you start to pick up on an enemy’s attack patterns and find yourself deflecting each hit of an incoming combo. One clever wrinkle is that your Spirit meter is also a resource that can be spent on spells, special martial arts abilities, and Spirit attacks. That’s a nice risk-reward mechanic that lets you put yourself in a potentially more vulnerable position in order to gain some sort of advantage. If you know an enemy has an elemental weakness, for instance, you can exploit that by spending Spirit to enchant your weapon with an element to stagger and quickly break them. Martial arts abilities are unique depending on the weapon you’re wielding, and there are many that offer powerful attacks that can either do big single-target damage or give you a way to deal with many enemies at once. Finally, Spirit attacks are powerful strikes that increase in damage the more Spirit you have built up, which give you another reason to hold onto your Spirit meter until you need it. If it’s not already clear, there are tons of layers to Wo Long’s combat, which greatly enhances the already excellent swordplay by laying out a ton of options and ways to vary up my strategy whenever I found myself dying repeatedly to a particular boss. If just straight-up attacking didn’t work I could focus more on defense and reduce their Spirit by deflecting their big attacks; failing that, I could double down on rushing them down and trying to break their Spirit with aggressive attacks and martial arts abilities. Or, if I could figure out what they were weak to, I could try using spells. So while Wo Long is certainly tough, I never felt like I was ever stuck against a wall with no idea of what else I could try or how to overcome a particular challenge. Where Wo Long feels very similar to the previous three Team Ninja soulslikes – in a bad way – is in its loot. More specifically, there’s an overabundance of it. I became absolutely inundated with garbage gear that I had no use for within just a few hours, and it only got worse after that. I’m just not the kind of person who really wants to spend 10 to 15 minutes in a menu trying to decipher whether a -2.6% reduction in Martial Arts Spirit is worth sacrificing a +7.2% Genuine Qi Obtention, or if I’m willing to sacrifice a few points of attack power for +24 alliance Spirit defense. Those simply aren’t interesting decisions – those are spreadsheet entries and math problems, and it’s made worse by not even being able to sort your massive list of weapons by set, or by a specific special effect you’re looking for. I’m fully aware that there are people who love these games for this level of hyper-specific build optimization, and if that is you, then you’ll find a lot to appreciate here. You can salvage junk gear to extract their special effects, then slot those special effects into weapons that you want to use, and then you can copy the appearance of any other weapon or armor so you don’t have to worry about being forced to use an ugly weapon or armor set because it has great stats. It’s fairly exhaustive in its options, but it’s also not for those of us who prefer action to menu screens.  Fortunately, I found that I didn’t have to get too far in the weeds on my first playthrough because I was more than powerful enough just by engaging with loot on a surface level. For armor, I just picked whatever gave me the highest defense number without putting me into the heavyweight category, which would limit my mobility. Then I would pick a weapon type I liked, swap it with one with a higher gear score whenever I came across one; similarly, when I found one that came with a Martial Arts ability that I liked, I just upgraded that as high as I could. No major tweaking was necessary to keep me from falling behind the power curve, leaving the complexity for those who are looking to test their mettle in the multiple iterations of New Game+ or PvP invasions. One of my favorite new ideas in Wo Long is the addition of Morale Ranks, which is basically a separate progression system that starts at zero at the beginning of every main mission and goes all the way up to 25. You gain morale simply by defeating enemies, but you’ll gain it even faster by killing them using Spirit attacks, Martial Arts abilities, or critical strikes. You will also lose some morale everytime you die, up to a certain point determined by your fortitude level, which you can increase by finding various flag poles throughout each mission. Enemies have Morale Ranks too, and those with a higher rank than you deal more damage. I love this addition because it gives every level a very natural ramp-up in difficulty, while adding extra incentive to explore and mop up more bad guys. Each level begins fairly easy: a bunch of low-morale-rank enemies make up the majority of foes, with a few high-rank monsters sprinkled in here and there to give you an occasional challenging fight. By the time you’re near the end of the level though, you’re regularly going up against rank 20 enemies and bosses that will be really tough to deal with if you haven’t been thorough in clearing out the opposition. Much like Nioh, Wo Long’s campaign is broken up into main missions and side missions, with the main missions taking you through humongous levels – from castles, to active battlefields, to jails with Dark Souls-like poison ponds on the ground floor – and the side missions typically having you revisit those settings with some sort of fun twist with regard to the objective and enemy placements. Some of my favorite side missions even have you sparring against your allies in challenging boss battles. One of the really great things that Wo Long does is that it allows you to exit out of a mission from a Battle Flag and save your progress on that main mission. <s>This is a wonderful safety net, because frequently what can happen is you can find yourself underleveled and stuck on a main mission; here you’re allowed to back out to the level select, complete some side missions to level up or get new gear, maybe head to your secret village home base to upgrade that gear, and then return right where you left off on that main mission without feeling like you’ve lost your hard-fought progress.</s> [Editor's Note: You actually can't do this. I tried it while I was reviewing and must have got confused by similar looking checkpoints, because it doesn't work for me now. It doesn't change my overall score or impressions, but it's a bit of a bummer]. The levels themselves won’t win any awards for how they look, but they’re very well designed from a gameplay perspective. Branching paths that often allow you to find an easier way through a particularly tough area and tons of easily missable optional detours leading to bountiful rewards keep them from being straightforward paths from point A to point B. Wo Long’s biggest problem – bigger than the loot issues and the poor storytelling – is its enemy variety. Even though the combat system is excellent and varied, there’s simply not enough different types of opponents to fill a game of this size. The ones that are here are fantastic and fun to fight, don’t get me wrong, but part of the fun of a soulslike is encountering a new threat, learning their attack patterns, and finding ways to get through the fight without taking heavy damage. In Wo Long, I felt like I figured out everything I needed to know to get through every non-boss encounter by hour five of a game that, in total, took me about 22 hours to beat. That took out a lot of the tension and fear of death that these games thrive on. Without the anxiety that something unexpected might be lying in wait around the next corner, Wo Long is still a very challenging game, but one that lacks a certain sense of adventure. It’s also worth mentioning that Wo Long also includes online co-op for up to three players, an extensive New Game+ for those who really want to min/max their characters to the extreme, and even has PvP invasions (which you can opt out of if you’d prefer to deal with relatively easy AI invaders). Unfortunately, not enough people were playing ahead of launch for me to test the competitive multiplayer features out for this review, but cooperative play is super easy to set up and play through, just like it has been in prior Team Ninja soulslikes. You can either recruit random strangers into your game from within a level when you need help, or you can start a level fresh from the beginning with a friend.  Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty’s combat plays very differently from Team Ninja’s own Nioh games – more in the mold of Sekiro than Dark Souls – and yet it manages to excel and falter in just about the same areas. When it comes to the clashing of melee weapons, Wo Long is among the best in the genre, full stop. Its action is fast and thrilling, the options for taking down its ferocious enemies are many and immensely rewarding to master, and its deflection-heavy combat is one of the most satisfying since Sekiro. All of those strengths outweigh an overbearing loot system, poor storytelling, and even a disappointing lack of variety in enemies. If not for that, Wo Long might’ve been one of Team Ninja’s greatest achievements – as it is, it’s simply a great one. "
Scars Above ,5,"As I took my first steps on Scars Above’s mysterious planet, I felt my excitement and fear rising. Almost immediately, an encounter with its grotesque alien creatures turned out to be much more complicated than I anticipated. I even died a couple of times before making any significant progress at all, giving me the impression that I was at the beginning of a harsh and nervewracking journey that was going to ask the very best of me to survive on its default difficulty level. But my fear of the unknown proved to be unjustified in this case, and the initial thrill dissipated after an hour or so when I’d unlocked the first few of a vast arsenal of weapons. After that, most of my battles became trivial, and they remained that way until the very end – even when I turned the difficulty up to hard.   Scars Above’s first section is calm. You’re introduced to your protagonist, Doctor Kate Ward, and the rest of the space scientific crew while they are investigating a strange object in Earth’s orbit. Some silly chit-chat, puzzles, and exposition later, you get to (barely) know your team and craft your first device — a tool that will become like the standard assault rifle you find in most shooters, but with shock ammo. Then, you’ll hear an unnecessarily serious speech from your captain that is supposed to be inspiring but ends up being cheesy due to its delivery and timing. The next thing you know, you wake up on an unknown planet with no idea about what happened or where everyone went.  Right after picking up an electric cutter – a basic melee weapon with the most boring attack pattern I’ve seen – I faced the first enemy. This one was easy enough, a kind of spider that usually brings some friends but doesn’t really mean any trouble — unless there are too many friends. However, when I grabbed the assault rifle I’d built and got back to the main road, it was the turn of the second type of creature: a mutated scorpion that usually hides underwater. It surprised me coming out of nowhere, and then zapped me with a poison projectile. After dealing with the beast and his partner, I realized that my life was still going down thanks to the new status. There was no way of curing this, and a few seconds later, I was respawning at the checkpoint. The same scene repeated a few times until I managed to stop catching the beast’s vomit with my face and reached the next checkpoint. What honestly felt unfair at first became the most important lesson I learned through the nine hours and six chapters of Scars Above: keep your distance from the enemies and everything they throw at you. Your electric cutter is a joke – even with the charged attack that you can unlock, it will always leave you exposed when you could just blow the aliens’ heads off with a good headshot. Of course, sometimes this will be challenging in a linear third-person shooter in which you’ll face faster monsters and smaller spaces with nowhere to run as you move through levels, but after the first couple of hours you probably won’t need any combat tips at all. You quickly craft new guns and gadgets and level up, and before long you’ll end up being so powerful that you’ll find little to no resistance. In essence, the weapons in Scars Above are the typical guns you’ll expect from any type of shooter, but with an elemental twist: there’s the aforementioned assault rifle with electric bullets, a gun that can be charged up to shoot fire ammo, a grenade launcher that freezes enemies, and a shotgun that disintegrates them with acid. As you might imagine, you can chain attacks with these weapons and produce elemental reactions that will deal bonus damage to anything that comes near you, and you can also use the environment to your advantage. Fire and acid bullets create a strong explosion, while shooting an enemy standing on water with your grenade launcher will freeze it faster. Some enemies will have a weak point in their body that will represent the element you want to shoot them with, and there are color-coded orbs around the levels that are effectively explosive barrels that deal elemental damage, too. This is a clever way of making you change weapons at all times, thinking of which is the best and most effective plan against what’s in front of you. It kept me interested for a while… until I realized that the system worked a little too well. Most of the creatures in front of me could be squashed in mere seconds by exploiting any possible elemental combination, regardless of their strength or the situation. Instead of being one part of a larger plan, shooting an electric orb at the right time completely exterminated all the threats around. If this wasn’t enough of an advantage, Kate has the ability to craft a variety of gadgets, such as a barrier that protects her for a few hits, a gravity grenade that makes everything in its area except you slow for way too many seconds, or a hologram that baits creatures, among others. All of these use the same resource (batteries), which are crafted from a resource that’s pretty much everywhere, or replenished by refilling your inventory at any checkpoint. This is way too convenient because it means you’ll hardly run out of ammo or crafting resources, especially after you’ve increased your carrying capacity. What’s worse is that the variety of gadgets that seem interesting and well thought-out when used individually felt useless when they start to overlap with each other. For instance, you can basically spam the gravity grenade and earn effectively the exact effect and/or advantages of all the other gadgets. And you can forget about dying when you find permanent healing items with several charges that can be easily refilled.  Some regular enemies that you’ll discover later will make things a bit more interesting, like one beast that can teleport behind you or a fungus monster that blinds you. They arrived a bit too late to the party, though, after I’d already become pretty bored by several hours of effortlessly killing everything around me. Not even the bosses stand out as challenges, except perhaps for the first one that you meet while you’re still creating your basic guns. That doesn’t mean that these battles are completely uninspired – they do come with mechanics that will keep you changing ammo constantly and moving around big arenas. They are fun while they last, but they also don’t present ideas that you haven’t seen already in other games (and better executed). For example, breaking the surface where an enemy is standing isn’t exactly new, and it doesn’t feel great either when you can do it more than once in a row without letting the boss move or shoot you back if you’re fast enough. The fact that some boss battles are repeated doesn’t help the case, either. What’s so frustrating about all of these issues is that Scars Above has its moments of pure joy. Facing a new creature for the first time normally involves a moment of genuine surprise, and figuring out how to handle them is engaging. Even being an unstoppable killing machine can bring satisfaction when you feel rewarded by perfectly understanding the tools at your disposal, or just by feeling your own power. And some of the later areas even took me by surprise with their scatological and repulsive (but in a good way) design, at least when compared to the dull plains and boring swamps from the earlier stages. The lack of a map directing you around is a good choice as it makes you follow your intuition and find the way, even if none of the scenarios are really big or full of secret pathways. The building blocks for a more engaging game are here, but they are surrounded by elements that lack polish, depth, and any sense of challenge.  Apart from fighting, you’ll spend time analyzing resources, clues left in the environment, and some pretty basic symbol-matching puzzles. There’s an intention of bringing a scientific perspective, considering our protagonist’s background, which is mixed in the exploration – for example, when scanning unknown objects we hear what Kate is thinking. She approaches how one creature’s digestive system works with genuine amazement, wondering how its body evolved into that group of organs and functions. The delivery of Erin Yvette, Kate’s voice actor, feels fresh and embodies a character more worried about discovering and understanding what’s around her during these calmer moments. It’s a shame that her face lacks any expression during most cutscenes, creating an unintentionally hilarious contradiction between what we are hearing and what we see.  The objective of finding the rest of the crew is one of the main plot points, but it is weak and lacks any motivation due to the fact that we don’t know anything about them. I can’t tell you a single thing about any character apart from that they are “people of science” and one of the dudes has a cute little cat toy that wears a hoodie. The intended emotional moments don’t land and some of the transitions between scenes are incredibly abrupt, killing the pacing and the tension built.  Something similar could be said about the plot. While Kate’s motivations are clear and you always know why you’re doing what you’re doing and why, it can’t be said that it’s interesting or original at all. The world of Scars Above feels flat, with some cool alien designs here and there, but not much else that made me want to explore every corner or find all the available audio logs. Far into the story, there are some cool ideas that I won’t spoil, but they are either abandoned or never pay out in any major way, and it’s a disappointment to watch them fizzle out. Scars Above shows a lot of potential in its third-person shooting, fun elemental reactions, and a good number of creatures to experiment with. The thrill of setting out to discover a new alien world is short-lived, however, due to the weapons and gadgets in your arsenal quickly growing so powerful that nothing poses a threat.  And while there are a few excellent environments to explore, everything within them – the characters, story, and universe – feel weak and underdeveloped, giving you few reasons to stop and smell the alien roses once you’ve blasted your way through. "
Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe ,7,"There are generally two types of Kirby games: the standard platformers where Kirby copies enemy abilities across easy-to-complete stages, and the more unique adventures that break wildly from that formula. Kirby’s Return to Dream Land has been solidly in the former camp since its original release on Wii in 2011, making its Deluxe rerelease on Switch recognizable in more ways than one.<strong> </strong> Strong platforming fundamentals, creative late-game level design, and some worthwhile new content still make it worth revisiting, but it’s a more appealing package for newcomers than those who have already gone on the original adventure.   Like those aforementioned traditional Kirby platformers, the first few worlds in Kirby’s Return to Dreamland Deluxe are so remarkably unchallenging that they strip away any sense of resistance and, frankly, fun to be had. Flashy Super Abilities, which allow Kirby to do things like roll enemies up into a giant snowball or slash a massive sword across the screen, often start as almost automated sections that require very little player input. It’s important to have games that welcome newcomers, but it takes at least a couple of hours before this adventure begins to feel even remotely interesting, regardless of if you’re playing solo or with friends. However, once you reach that latter half of the campaign, Return to Dream Land begins to reveal what it’s really about. The platforming stages start relying upon Kirby’s copy abilities more heavily, like using the Water ability to skim across fiery blocks, or the Jump ability to soar to new heights by letting him leap vertically and knock enemies out of his way. And it does all of this while throwing increasingly difficult challenges in your path, whether those are (often repetitive) mini bosses fighting you on screens with pitfalls and other dangers in the way, or platforming challenges that have you escaping a wall of death with creative obstacles to scurry around. Kirby is not necessarily for you or me, but for our children, brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews. It is a whimsical, charming adventure that has clearly been designed for a younger audience first and others second. That's not a bad thing, but it does come with limitations. It's a little frustrating that Nintendo couldn't have aimed for both audiences at the same time, and I know when I was a kid I would have killed for the harder challenge, but you can only fault the game so much for that. <i>- Richard George, October 24, 2011</i Read the full <u>Kirby’s Return to Dream Land review</u The final stretch of Return to Dream Land, in particular, feels like the original developers were able to let loose with a relatively challenging (but never frustrating) conclusion that’s filled with creative levels and enemies alike. The finale in particular is a wild ride, standing tall with surprising twists and genuine challenge. In all, it took me about six hours to float through the main story of Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and over half of that runtime felt well worth the journey. Then there’s the multiplayer of it all. Up to three friends  can hop in and out locally at any point. They’ll play as either Meta Knight, King Dedede, or Bandana Waddle Dee, who essentially take on one distinct copy ability apiece (Sword, Hammer, and Spear, respectively) and can stack on top of each other or be carried across stages. Playing with this many players blunts some of the finer details of the level design, as it quickly becomes a chaotic game of trying to quickly clear enemies and get to the goal first – a section where you are supposed to time your movements to avoid boulders can quickly just become… run through the boulders and hope someone gets to the other side. Boss patterns can also essentially be ignored as each character pummels the enemy to oblivion. Stages in general feel designed specifically around single-player, but still work with a bigger group if that’s how you choose to play. However, like similar multiplayer platformers, there’s plenty of fun to be had just goofing around levels with a few friends. The multiplayer is probably best served as a sort of “guardian mode” where you can have a less experienced player tag along and play with you, giving Return to Dream Land yet another way to welcome newcomers.  So that’s the original Return to Dream Land, but what the heck is new to this Deluxe version? The most obvious improvement is the graphical overhaul – outside of 2022’s Kirby and the Forgotten Land, this is easily the best Kirby has ever looked, with character models, environments, cutscenes, and everything else looking remarkably improved over the 2011 Wii original. It’s also filled to the brim with charm and small details, like cowboy Kirby walking with a bit of a strut when he’s using the Whip ability. Then there are a few additions to the adventure itself. Three new abilities have been added for Kirby to wreak havoc with: Sand, Mecha, and Festival. Sand allows Kirby to form flurries into objects like sand castles and fists to smack opponents around with. The Mecha ability lets Kirby fly around the screen quickly, shoot off lasers, drop deadly mines, and fire rockets at foes above – it’s probably the most powerful copy ability in Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and my personal favorite. They’ve also brought the Festival ability over from Star Allies, which turns enemies on screen into point stars and health-recovering food items. They fit in so well that had I not known any better, I would have just assumed they were always in the original release as well.  In line with Return to Dream Land being an entry-level platformer, Deluxe also adds an easy mode called Helper Magolor. This character from another planet tosses Kirby helpful items (including health-doubling potions) and saves him when he falls into bottomless pits. While most people probably won’t need this mode turned on, it’s a great option for new or young gamers to help get their feet wet.  Speaking of Magolor, he’s the star of Deluxe’s single biggest addition – Magolor Epilogue: The Interdimensional Traveler. In this roughly two-hour mini adventure, you control an interplanetary character, who begins by being stripped of all of his powers, á la Metroid. But through collecting magic points across brand-new stages, you can purchase increasingly powerful abilities, like bombs you can gleefully rain down upon your enemies. This mode starts a bit slow, with Magolor being intentionally sluggish and relatively weak, but by the end of the journey he can become a downright powerhouse. The stages themselves are about the same quality as what’s seen in the main game, with challenge levels available to unlock if you’ve already purchased their corresponding abilities. Kirby’s signature ability to copy powers is missed in this mode, but it’s fun to get a taste of what a Kirby-style platformer that unfolds with more progression would play like. True to its name, the Magolor Epilogue can only be played after the main story is finished. Narratively this makes sense, though let’s be honest: nothing in a Kirby game’s story is particularly groundbreaking, and not letting returning players jump right into it feels a little unnecessary. Along those lines, Deluxe includes the original’s Extra Mode, which is a much more difficult version of the main story that gives Kirby less health, adds more enemies to deal with, gives bosses more challenging forms, and more. However, it also cannot be accessed until after the main mode is finished, which seems silly for a Deluxe version that plays almost identically to the original. There’s also Arena Mode, which similarly unlocks following the main story as a boss rush of sorts to further test your skills. While those certainly pad out the overall play time, I would have preferred access to them right off the bat. New to the package is Merry Magoland, a theme park filled with “sub-games” that put you against other players. In the original Wii version, Magolor’s ship (the Lor Starcutter) housed several of these minigames, but now they also exist in this colorful area, and there are two new minigames to play around with in addition to the original eight. The minigames themselves are well-made but relatively shallow, reminding me of the time I spent playing Pokemon Stadium’s minigames with my friends as a kid. They range from the star-throwing Ninja Dojo, where you try to hit moving targets either using button presses or motion-controlled throws with their Joy-Con, to the classic Samurai Kirby, a dueling minigame where each player attempts to slice as quickly as possible when prompted. They can all be played through in about half an hour and don’t add a huge amount of value to the package, but earning cosmetic masks through Magoland and playing with them in the main game can be a fun diversion. Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe takes a fun but straightforward Wii platformer, freshens it up visually, and adds a new mini adventure to pad out its otherwise relatively short campaign. Kirby’s journey across Planet Popstar starts as a slow, overly easy drudge. But once the difficulty picks up and the stages become more creative, this platformer shines through to its over-the-top conclusion – even if that conclusion comes far too soon. The Magolor Epilogue is also a welcome addition that stands on its own as another brief but worthwhile story. Return to Dream Land certainly isn’t Kirby’s best or most creative outing, but if you haven’t already played it on Wii, the Deluxe version is the ideal way to see what a traditional Kirby game is all about. "
Atomic Heart ,8,"There’s a lot to be said about unapologetically single-player games like Atomic Heart: its entire focus is on creating an intricate world for us to explore and discover for ourselves. An eye-catching blend of super-powered shooting and first-person puzzling, this is a lengthy, tough, and terrific-looking shooter that has us bathing in the blood and gears of elaborately designed enemies both biological and robotic and dispatching them with an impressive set of combat options. Granted, it’s not as clever as it thinks it is when dealing with melee combat or its typical fetch quests, and the story doesn’t <i>quite</i> stick its landing, but the journey from point A to point B is a sight to behold. Atomic Heart is an alternate-history shooter cut from the same cloth as BioShock and MachineGames’ Wolfenstein series. It’s a kind of retrofuturistic romp back to an imagined past perverted by ridiculously advanced technology; a world where science has made the supernatural a reality and robots are now running rife. These are far from the only shooters Atomic Heart is unafraid to crib from, either. Half-Life and the puzzle-solving of Portal are also clear inspirations, and there’s been an attempted sprinkling of Arkane’s successful brand of first-person stealth, too.  However, it’d be unfair to call Atomic Heart wholly derivative despite such recognisable building blocks. Certainly the idea of a peaceful utopia torn to pieces thanks to technology turning on its ambitious masters is nothing new, but developer Mundfish has still assembled its vision in a confident and compelling way – and the art team here well and truly understood the assignment. The most remarkable element here is the superb visual design, especially the look of these well-crafted enemies. Its range of robots is particularly strong, from its sleek and sinister moustachioed terminators that charge at us without ever averting their gaze to its pot-bellied parking meters with mouth tubes that make them look like they’re sucking at the drawstring on an invisible jacket. Its featureless ballerina bots and spindly-legged battle balls are equally memorable – the latter of which are probably best described as scaled-down, Eastern Bloc knock-offs of those things that couldn’t kill Mr. Incredible. There’s even one that looks like Baymax cosplaying as a tank. Atomic Heart’s outstanding aesthetic also extends to its large range of partially ruined labs, facilities, and transportation hubs – each filled with long, snaking globules of the liquid polymer that powers the advancements of this fantastical 1950s. That said, there is a distinct feeling of ‘look, don’t touch’ in these places (there’s definitely a lack of destructibility; balloons immune to axe swings are probably the worst offenders) but the level of detail overall is strikingly good. There are some especially tiny touches in Atomic Heart that smack of a great deal of consideration, like the way there are different reload animations for unspent magazines compared to empty ones – the latter of which are flicked away while the former are grasped by the same hand sliding a fresh one in. Watching them play out is a pleasure, which is why it was a bit annoying that my HUD was sometimes cluttered up with pick-up notifications and health bars for minibosses no longer in the area that froze onscreen until I reloaded from a recent save. I’ve also experienced some uneven quality when it comes to graphical glitches as I’ve played on Xbox Series X. The worst is a terrible strobing effect on some fast-moving robots running circuits around a large room, but fortunately it seems mostly isolated to these bot types. I’ve had no such problems with similarly nimble (and often much larger) bosses. Atomic Heart is, naturally, all tinted with the Soviet-era iconography you’d probably expect from a land tucked away deep behind the Iron Curtain in the mid-1950s, and admittedly the lens through which you may view all this Soviet symbolism is a little different today in 2023 than it was upon its announcement and first reveal back in 2018. Of course, having grown up geographically isolated and politically irrelevant in the southern hemisphere – largely detached from Cold War concerns and raised on Bond movies, Stripes, and Rocky IV – my read on such an overtly Russian backdrop is guaranteed to be markedly different to someone with roots in Eastern Europe. For its part, however, the background does largely fade away as Atomic Heart peels back the layers of its false utopia. At this stage, Facility 3826 and the countryside of rural Russia isn’t much different to the likes of BioShock’s Rapture itself. That is, a place more or less cut off from the outside world and where something has gone deeply, deeply wrong. Exploring exactly <i>what’s</i> gone wrong is the job of our character, special forces veteran Major Sergey Nechaev, or P-3 as he’s dubbed throughout. The foul-mouthed and amnestic P-3 is admittedly a bit of a relic of games gone by – and his default English-language voiceover doesn’t exactly do him a lot of favours. He comes off as the cookie-cutter American lead of every second shooter ever made. However, it’s the script that really does him a greater disservice. While I’ll happily admit swearing is virtually my second language, P-3 spews it with the gusto of a teenage boy testing every curse word he’s recently learned twice a sentence. It’s a little exhausting, and the presence of many modern turns of phrase don’t exactly help keep the overall experience seated in the 1950s. Of course, perhaps I’m being hypocritical in demanding consistency there, because the regularly ruthless soundtrack packed with headbangers courtesy of Doom and Wolfenstein composer Mick Gordon isn’t exactly a sonic journey back to the days of doo-wop, either – and yet the music is pitch perfect as far as I’m concerned. At any rate, there is a Russian-language/English subtitle option for purists, but I would’ve simply preferred an English script that was more tempered for the setting and era. There are well over 20-odd hours of play here in the main story thread alone, with many more available in the side objectives – some of which border on crucial if you actually want the best weapons. Some of that is padding but it’s a good length overall, and nicely inside that not-too-short, not-too-long Goldilocks zone for a great solo shooter. There are also two endings you can get based on just one choice you make in the finale, although after seeing both I found the first anticlimactic and don’t think the second was worth the reload. However, while P-3 is disappointingly threadbare as a character, he’s nonetheless very capable and entertaining to play as – largely thanks to his partner, Charles, who is a talking glove. Okay, that’s a bit reductive – rather, Charles is basically an intelligent system embedded in P-3 who is capable of granting him seemingly supernatural abilities, manifested by a set of small, squid-like tentacles that extend from a glove on P-3’s left hand. This not only includes activating an X-ray-style view of your surroundings and tossing certain small objects à la Half-Life 2’s iconic gravity gun, but also the ability to fire bolts of electricity or ice, levitate enemies into the air to shoot or slam into the ground, or even summon a temporary shield. Akin to BioShock’s Plasmids, these abilities add an important layer of more interesting combat on top of Atomic Heart’s otherwise fairly typical blasting and slightly clumsy melee combat. There’s a great sense of weight when beaning a bot in the brainpan with an axe – and the gouges that appear across their bodies in real-time is a great touch – but I found the weapon swinging too slow and frustrating when swarmed by too many enemies simultaneously. The juggling act of defeating dense swarms of robots as well as the blender-sized hovering repair bots that continually swoop in to magically resurrect them gets a bit wearisome at times, especially above ground. Atomic Heart’s linear, underground sequences are linked by a decent-sized slab of open world where we’re free to explore and fight wherever we wish, and this zone is initially a nice antidote to the more corralled corridor segments that progress the story or reward us with useful upgrades. However, with their long line-of-sight and overwhelming numbers, I often found myself running or driving away from fights rather than diving in or trying to get the upper hand via stealth before attacking – because they’re not that much fun to fight over and over. There is a way to fry all enemies within a zone for a while if you’re patient, and the robot hordes do become a little less intimidating as P-3 and his arsenal grow stronger throughout the story, but that’s a process that takes some time. Unlocking and upgrading these abilities requires a steady supply of resources, which the levels and defeated enemies are generally chock full of, even if collecting them can become a bit of a chore. Atomic Heart is smart to keep this process fast by allowing us to extend out a hand and suck up reams of resources like an industrial shop vac, but it still becomes a little tedious having to ransack the same sets of desks and cabinets arranged slightly differently in a hundred-or-so different rooms. Tedious, too, is Atomic Heart’s overly ambitious attempt to weasel its way out of accountability for leaning on some extremely hackneyed fetch quests. Having the main character cynically gripe and complain about collecting four canisters for a bafflingly unintuitive door-locking mechanism that would never get past any sensible architectural committee isn’t a free pass to proceed with it. The main character being annoyed for the same reason I am isn’t cute, it’s a tone deaf non-apology for weak game design. It’s a shame that some better context wasn’t baked around these occasional fetch quests because Atomic Heart’s underground chambers feel like a ripe opportunity and are largely great otherwise: eerie, deadly, and mostly devoid of life – unless you count the mutant freaks with skulls shattered into fanged, floral arrangements or the dead bodies that communicate via the confused ramblings of their fading brain implants. It does rely too heavily on repeating the same handful of door lock minigames that serve no real purpose other than to arbitrarily slow your progression from room to room, but I do like the bespoke platforming puzzle chambers and one-off brainteasers – especially the clever visual puzzle you’ll encounter late during your trip to an ornate theatre full of robotic performers. Atomic Heart is a deeply ambitious, highly imaginative, and consistently impressive atompunk-inspired attempt at picking up where the likes of BioShock left off – something it’s done with a lot of success. It certainly makes missteps, chiefly with an irritating leading man and a self-indulgent habit of using the same tired tropes it tries to make fun of, but this stern, superpowered, and stringently solo shooter has worked its way under my skin despite these flaws. Atomic Heart didn’t always blow me away, but it definitely has the ticker to punch well above its weight. "
Metroid Prime Remastered ,10,"In the two decades since the original release of Metroid Prime I’ve had no problem giving it my highest recommendation, along with one nagging reservation: <i>The controls take some getting used to.</i> Thanks to the outstanding updates in Metroid Prime Remastered, I can finally drop that caveat: Metroid Prime Remastered is one of the best first-person shooters ever made, full stop. This updated version goes above and beyond the typical coat-of-paint remaster by adding modern controls along with fabulously improved models and textures – it’s a perfect example of how to both honor a lauded classic and bring it up to code. Replaying it feels almost entirely new, evoking that same fresh feeling as the Dead Space remake or Resident Evil 2 and 3 despite not actually being such a drastic remake itself – and it’s a far cry from the disappointing treatment that the Super Mario 3D All-Stars collection on Switch received.   What makes Metroid Prime obviously different from other legendary FPS campaigns like Halo, Half-Life, Titanfall 2, and Wolfenstein is its solitary nature. There’s not a single conversation to be had, no radio or AI assistant voices chattering in your ear, and, just for the record, no multiplayer. This is a game about a lone hunter – Samus Aran – on a hostile world, and Prime revels in that setup. Like other great Metroid games (e.g. Super Metroid, Metroid: Zero Mission, and the most recent Metroid Dread), Metroid Prime’s spareness in its storytelling makes for a uniquely moody magnificence. It’s more horror than space opera, no doubt owing to Metroid’s key influence, Ridley Scott’s 1979 masterpiece movie, Alien. The planet, Tallon IV, has as much or more development than any character, told in its geology, technology, flora, fauna, and “other” –  and yes, in much of the encyclopedic lore you acquire via a HUD scanning function. In this way the story is told through experience with your environment alone, and despite the narrative methods not getting any sort of update, it still feels revolutionary and modern compared to all the very talky games we play today. (It must be noted that attempts at adding a bunch of characters hasn’t been great for the Metroid series, specifically, with Metroid: Other M and Metroid Prime: Hunters being especially goofy in their world-building.) There are so many things to laud in Metroid Prime, but its biggest accomplishment is Tallon IV itself. Each room has a purpose and a name, with details that make no two places quite alike. A flowing fountain babbles down the side of a sunny sanctuary hall; a furnace chamber pumps heat through conveniently morph-ball sized vents to other areas; a lab deep underground holds experiments in tubes that act as jump-scare time bombs. It’s all logically laid out to reflect the story and setting, but the world mirrors your progress in a brilliant way: Rooms that once took toil and grit to get through can soon be zipped through with the help of a newly obtained skill or weapon.  strong>Arm Canon</strong  Originally the controls for Metroid Prime on GameCube were so clumsy and awkward that its fans had to argue it was not an FPS at all, but something else, such as a first-person puzzle game. You had to lock onto a target and shoot, instead of allowing full, dual-joystick movement, and trying to go from any other shooter to this was like having to learn to walk again. Since then we’ve seen options to use the Wii-like motion controls established in the Metroid Prime Trilogy collection, or a variant of the original controls on the GameCube controller, but none made it something that was easy for most people to pick up and play. The new dual analog stick controls are indistinguishable from modern shooters, though, and actually make some battles a bit easier. You can strafe, jump, dodge, and control your view with so much more dexterity. The way you experience the ruins, caves, and laboratories of Tallon IV is through a visor, set in a helmet in your suit, which is a perfect setup for immersion in first-person. The visor’s HUD gives you all of your basic info, like many games have come to do since, but it also acts like a real, hi-tech glass dome: it steams up when blasted with flame, muffles Samus’s cries, and in flashes of bright light it’ll even reflect her own surprised eyes for an instant. These are all brilliant little tricks that cause the barrier between you and the world on your TV or Switch screen to melt away, allowing you to meld dreamily into it – which is why it is all the more jarring (in a good way!) when you pop out into the third-person Morph Ball view. You can enter your Morph Ball mode at any time, and when you do, the camera flies outward so you can watch as Samus collapses into a knee-high ball and performs a number of rolling, Tony Hawk-like maneuvers to solve puzzles, get through cramped areas, or just zoom really fast while backtracking. Many rooms have a feature that requires you to switch forms, ranging from a simple hidden passageway to a maze-like physics-based contraption you must navigate with precision rolling; it challenges your dexterity in an entirely different way than the first-person shooting or platforming. You’ll get occasional looks at Samus in the third person when she’s not in ball form, such as in the rare (high frame rate, completely and gorgeously remodeled) cutscenes, but sometimes you also get a glimpse of her as the camera rushes back into her helmet, a rare flash that reveals the complexity of building a game around what’s basically a first-person shooter / pinball machine mash-up. Aside from the third-person Morph Ball, Metroid Prime Remastered has you doing a lot of things a side-scrolling Metroid would: jumping across precarious platforms, swinging from a grappling hook, and ascending huge, vertical spaces, littered with hostile critters. This was all quite novel in 2002 but feels standard today: Clever implementation of a double-jump gives you an extra period of mid-air adjustment to solve so many precision-jumping and grappling issues, and Prime is forgiving with what’s under your feet so there isn’t a lot of replaying areas due to frustrating falls. You can definitely miss a platform, but it’s nothing that wouldn’t happen in Super Mario Bros. as well. What’s interesting is how much better I am at platforming in first-person after 20 years of Halo games, because modern shooters just all do this now and it's in my FPS muscle memory. The Metroid Prime Remaster still sticks the landings – and the jumps. And while I mostly played on a Pro Controller, the fact that Metroid Prime is portable is still mind-blowing, if less novel six years into the Switch’s life. Of course, all shooters that use triggers are less comfortable on the Switch’s Joy-Con-attached setup, and Prime does have one odd quirk in its default controls that make you hit both the trigger to charge a shot and the shoulder button to fire it. That’s not ideal on either controller setup, but it’s especially cumbersome on the Joy-Cons because those buttons are so small and close together. Wii-style pointer controls using a detached pair of Joy-Cons are included as well, emulating the controls used in the Metroid Prime Trilogy on Wii. They work just as they should, which is a nice addition, but the new dual analog controls are the way to play Prime Remastered.  strong>In Its Prime</strong  Aside from the controls, the big addition to Metroid Prime Remastered is a complete overhaul of the graphics, which never lose sight of the art style that made the original so pretty. Water ripples, steam occludes, insects light the way and cast shadows like lanterns, metal reflects and shines (except for the mirrors; you can no longer see yourself in those for some reason); it all looks exquisite, as beautiful as any modern Switch game. Of all the beautiful moments exploring Tallon IV, nothing is ever recycled. There are hundreds of rooms, hallways, pools, and arenas, and none of them are alike – as evidenced by the intricate 3D map. Pan out from the map and you can see the insane geometry of Tallon IV. One of my favorite things to do in Prime is to pause, and, while the background music throbs, spin the map and look for tiny outlets that shouldn’t be there, a depression that could hint at a new path, or a door of a color I can’t access yet – those virtually always yield a secret when I investigate. I spend a good amount of playtime planning my routes on that map, too; there’s no fast travel in Metroid Prime, so if you want to be efficient, you need to think carefully about how you’re going to get from point A to point B. This makes collectible runs a blast, because knowing that once you get a new pickup that allows you to blast, roll, or grapple in a different way, you can plan a loop to revisit promising-looking areas with new gear to collect power ups. Of course there are elevators and other shortcuts to unlock, but the real power you amass in Metroid Prime is the ability to move freely over its pitfalls. One thing that surprised me was that, 20 years on, first-person shooters are still largely built around flat planes, straight corridors, and ballooning arenas. But Metroid Prime does something different: The world is molded and organic, with twisted tree roots, curvy mushrooms, and jagged ruins that interrupt deep pools; and that’s fun because a secret could be hidden <i>anywhere</i>. Whether you are scanning the room with your visor for clues, trying different ammo types on odd-looking textures, or attempting to roll up an apparent slope perfectly crafted for Morph Ball tricks, you have to actually <i>feel</i> your way around Prime. It’s the most tactile game I’ve ever played outside of VR. Metroid Prime Remastered sounds amazing as well. Some of old-school Metroid’s most memorable tunes are redone in the fun cyberpunk electronica of Prime, and the soundtrack’s original songs have stood the test of time themselves. What’s really cool about the remaster is the mix of sound effects you get on modern televisions or over headphones: a crucial aspect of secret hunting is sound, a sort of proximity-based hum you would do well to learn to recognize if you want to 100% Prime. It’s a blast slaughtering a room of screeching enemies just so you can silence them and listen closer to try and sort out where the heck that Missile Tank is hiding. And by the way, to get everything in Metroid Prime Remastered it took me about 13 hours. But I know what I’m doing (I <a href=""https://www.ign.com/wikis/metroid-prime/Missile_Tanks,_Energy_Tanks,_and_Power_Suit_Upgrade_Locations"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>contributed to the strategy guide</u></a>, and recommend using it for a 100% run!), and the Hard Mode you can unlock by beating it on Normal is worth a second go for a serious challenge.  strong>Remastered Blaster </strong  No matter how many new powers and weapons you unlock, you are never invincible in Metroid Prime – and it’s quite difficult on normal settings, as games go today. If you’re new to it, you might spot certain modern design similarities in the hunt to find your next save spot. Do you risk delving further into the depths of a region, or do you turn back and save the progress you’ve made? After an hour of plundering, your life bar low, and no new save spot in sight, things can get quite tense. This also makes the power ups – mainly life and ammo capacity expansions (but also some optional weapon upgrades I highly recommend) – incredibly meaningful because they increase your ability to explore farther and farther from safety. Unlike so many modern games’ collectible sets, spending time hunting things down really matters in Prime. By the back portion of the campaign you will need to use your full arsenal (and tons of ammo) to reach the end, but what cooler way to grind than to go hunt for secrets with your new gear? It’s an extremely rewarding loop. But you won’t just need to bulk up for further exploration. Boss fights in Metroid Prime come with multiple forms and large (often invisible) life bars, making them tougher than they appear at first glance. It’s one thing to figure out a boss’s patterns – which attacks you can jump, dodge, or cancel with a counter attack – but another to figure out if you are even doing damage. One boss throws enemies at you while it actually disappears to go recharge its life. You can get stuck in an endless battle if you don’t figure out the secret to interrupting this routine. This is a good example of how combat is made varied and interesting in Metroid Prime: often you will need to figure out which combination of visor (they can see at different wavelengths, exposing weaknesses), beam (you have fire, ice, and some others), and concussive ammo, works on each enemy. Do you freeze and shatter a titular metroid or fry it alive? And then… they adapt to your weapons and you can’t do either. Aside from a few main bosses that trap you, you usually flee tough fights, and sometimes sprinting through infested rooms is the only option.  There are other changes, big and little, that we’ve documented on this <a href=""https://www.ign.com/wikis/metroid-prime/Switch_Version_Differences_(Remaster_Changes)"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>Switch Version Differences page</u></a>, but some of the best besides the controls and graphics are the fast load times (no more waiting for doors to open), and the ability to toggle on the (English) narration that was present in the Japanese and European versions of the original. It’s only a few extra callouts, not enough to ruin the essential feeling of exploring in total solitude, but it’s a nice touch. One other significant change is that<a href=""/metroid-prime-remastered/64011/news/metroid-prime-developers-criticise-remaster-for-not-crediting-original-team""><u> the credits for the original Metroid Prime are missing</u></a> from the Remastered ending, so if you want to see who was responsible for much of the magic, <a href=""https://www.ign.com/wikis/metroid-prime/Full_GameCube_Version_Credits"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>here are the full Metroid Prime credits</u></a>.  Metroid Prime has been one of my favorite games for decades, but I’m still shocked that its bones are so strong. 21 years later, in 2023, Metroid Prime Remastered had to do so little beyond modernizing the controls and updating the graphics to become one of the best games you can buy once again. This ultimate solo mission is a respite from the noise of hint-giving companions and lengthy cinematic cutscenes that make up much of today’s single-player games. Those things have their place, but Metroid Prime Remastered shows that you can tell a story and create a grand adventure by building an amazing world and creating unique and fun tools to explore it with. I strongly encourage you to delve into Metroid Prime Remastered, and get lost. "
Octopath Traveler 2 ,7,"When I reviewed the original Octopath Traveler almost five years ago, I absolutely loved it. I was completely smitten with its art style, its spiritual and artistic connections to the 16-bit JRPGs I grew up with, and its amazing battle system. Playing Octopath Traveler 2, I was excited to see everything I loved about the original return. What’s surprising, however, is how little it's advanced in the last half-decade. In fact, outside of the specific stories being told, Octopath Traveler 2 is almost indistinguishable from its predecessor. That means it’s just as great in many ways, but that lack of novelty also makes it a bit less magical the second time around. Because Octopath Traveler 2 is so similar to its excellent predecessor, there’s no reason not to go back and play the original first. But the stories aren’t directly connected either, so if you are considering starting the journey here, you should know that once again the name ”Octopath” refers to the eight playable characters and the paths they follow through the world. You can choose to start with any of them, and after playing through the first hour-long chapter of their story you're stuck with that character for the rest of the campaign – meaning you can't remove them from your party. You're then free to wander the beautiful tilt-shift world, but areas are more or less locked out by their difficulty level. For example, if you enter an area with a ""Danger Level 16"" and you're at level five, you're going to be murdered pretty much instantly upon your first encounter. You might think to yourself ""Ah, but I am a seasoned JRPG veteran, I know a thing or two about how to approach high-level zones,"" but I'm here to tell you you're wrong. If the area says it's 16, you best have a party of characters at or above level 16.  Octopath Traveler is a JRPG dream come true. Both its battle system and aesthetic pay loving tribute to the Super NES era while moving the formula forward in exciting and novel ways. This isn’t merely a modern retread of past classics, but a phenomenal homage with genuinely fresh ideas in a fantastically charming wrapper of old-school meets new. While the eight different character stories could’ve used a little more connection between them, I’m looking forward to going back to complete them all, explore the many side areas, battle optional bosses, and unlock the final job classes. <i>- Seth Macy, July 12, 2018</i Read the full <a href=""/project-octopath-traveler/16822/review/octopath-traveler-review"">Octopath Traveler review</a>. Once you do begin wandering in your level-appropriate areas, you’ll come across new towns with new characters. Upon meeting a new character you're given the option to play through their first chapter or just add them to your party. I liked that it gives you the choice, since I prefer powering my way through games and asking questions later, but what I didn't like was discovering fairly late in the campaign how important it is to actually play through each chapter yourself. You're just going to have to trust me to avoid spoilers, but it’s too bad it ends up feeling like a deceptive choice. This time around, each character has a pair of special abilities: one for the day and one for the night. Day or night can be toggled at will, so it’s more like switching between modes than something you have to wait around for. It's pretty cool, because there are some characters you need to interact with who only show up at night, so you can just swap between the different versions of the world rather than drudge across town and visit an inn or whatever. Throné, the thief I chose as my starting character, pickpockets people during the day and ""ambushes"" them by night, putting them to sleep. The ambush skill is useful when, say, a doorway is blocked by an NPC, wgile pickpocket is a good way to load up on items without having to visit the shops. It's win-win! Other characters’ abilities include recruiting townspeople to summon during battles, fighting townspeople to learn special combat moves, and capturing monsters to call in during encounters, to name a few. Some of them are basically reskins of other characters' abilities – recruiting followers is the most common of the skills, for example, but it comes in handy when you have two or three extra sets of hands to summon in a battle. I like the system because it lets you pick and choose companions for future fights, but you can also just steal their stuff, too, and they don't even mind! The day/night cycle is most important in towns, but it also makes a difference in the overworld. Enemies are more difficult at night, which means more experience, so it can be a good idea to change to the night during your travels if you’re feeling confident. Travel between towns is done via connecting paths rather than an open overworld. It's more like traveling around in a Mana game or Chrono Trigger, versus a Final Fantasy or Dragon Warrior game. That's not a bad thing though, and I like that a game called ""Octopath Traveler"" makes you literally travel via paths from location to location. Beyond the towns and cities, there are temples to visit, which bless a character with a new ""EX"" ability. I recommend tracking down all these temples, because those abilities are extremely handy to have and make the late-game a little less arduous. Each character has their own multi-chapter story to progress through, but I did like how they’re all quite different in tone and scope. For example, Hikari's tale starts off with what's definitely the most epic and open of them all and most typical of what you’d expect in a massive 80-hour JRPG like this, while Partitio's is much more humble – and yet this simple merchant’s story surprised me and ended up being my favorite out of them all. I especially enjoyed the way Cassti's played out, with some entertaining fourth-wall-breaking moments. In fact, I found all of the individual stories' conclusions satisfying, but the paths leading up to them didn't always resonate with me, particularly the ones with less at stake. Again, it makes sense once you've completed them, but it’s harder to savor a story about a clumsy dancer trying to become famous in the moment when someone else is fighting to take back the stolen throne of their country. All the stories are at least an improvement over the original, although not so much that HBO is going to be optioning any of them for a gritty drama any time soon. It’s fortunate that I’m still a big fan of the excellent turn-based battle system from the first game, because it returns almost unchanged here. Each enemy has one or more ""weak points"" to uncover by hitting them with the right weapon or elemental attack. (It's not a glowing orb on the back of their head like you might be thinking for weak points in games, it's <i>a point of weakness</i>.) Once you uncover the weak point of an enemy type, it's displayed for every subsequent encounter. I loved the system in the first game, and I'm not surprised to see it return. However, it can get frustrating in some of the bigger boss battles, because you end up wasting so many attacks just trying to uncover weaknesses. Still, I really enjoy the extra dimenson it brings to fights as I try to line up my weak point attacks in a way that stuns a target so my most powerful regular attacks can do more damage, while also aiming to prevent the strongest enemies from getting a chance to attack me back. However, lifetime of playing turn-based JRPGs means I’ve grown accustomed to a certain predictability with the nature of a weak point, and enemy weaknesses here often feel entirely random. If you encounter an enemy that's clearly made of ice, the vocabulary of JRPGs (and, you know, physics) would suggest that creature would be weak to fire… but in Octopath Traveler 2 that's rarely the case at all. That frozen elemental is actually weak to light magic! Or ice for some reason! If there's a connection between enemy types and weaknesses it's not immediately clear, which means the first round of each battle with a newly discovered enemy is an exercise in guesswork (outside of the few character abilities that will provide a little starting intel). You're pretty safe shooting flying enemies with arrows to expose their weakness, but not <i>always</i>. It seems very arbitrary. On Nintendo Switch, I found Octopath Traveler 2 to be something of a downgrade from the original. The amazing 2D/3D art style returns, and areas seem like they're filled with even more 16-bit papercraft eye-candy, but some of the lighting effects I loved from the first – particularly the sparkles on the snowfields – are gone. I also encountered a problem where certain boss battles would freeze up entirely for long enough that I would start to panic, as well as certain sections of cutscenes hitching up and requiring me to hold 'B' to skip. Quitting out entirely and loading fixed these issues, but it was a huge bummer and led to some battles taking longer – even <i>much </i>longer – than they should have if it was running smoothly. I’m glad I didn’t have to uncover weaknesses every time because there is a fair amount of grinding involved in Octopath Traveler 2, which I don't necesarilly mind. Obviously opinions differ on this subject, but I find grinding in RPGs almost meditative, as long as putting in a little extra effort before a boss battle pays off in the end. You won't progress your party if you don't spend some time on that grind, as the leveling required to get to the next part of the story isn't achieved simply by following the path laid out. You're going to have to do some back and forth and running in circles and leveling up before you can move on. That being said, if you enter into a ""Danger Level 14"" area and reach the boss with a party at or near level 14, you should be able to defeat it, so I always had a clear idea of how far off I was. You can brute-force your way through some of the earlier bosses, just like in any JRPG, but the abilities systems, weakness exploits, and battle-point bonuses forced me to get pretty strategic with my thinking in order to do so. After losing a boss battle more than once, I would immediately take a look at my party: What strengths do they have? What complimentary skills can I employ to improve their abilities? Am I equipping the right secondary jobs and weapons? In other words, you cannot live by the grind alone. Once I struck the right balance of all the different elements, I was able to retry and bring down even the trickiest bosses, and it was a lot more rewarding because of it. That being said, the final boss sucks so much. Without spoiling anything, I will say that I went into the final boss fight confident in my team's abilities and strengths, only to be defeated time and time again. Of all the RPG boss battles I've played over the years, Octopath Traveler 2 gave me the most trouble. I was one attempt away from making a spreadsheet – and no, that is not a joke. The only reason I finally beat the boss wasn't because I was over-leveled (which I was… by a lot), but because I took a deep breath and literally wrote out battle notes before my final attempt. I struck a balance of skills, weapons, character matches, and item use and gave more thought and organization to that final encounter than I think I've ever done in a game, ever. No joke, I spent more than 10 hours trying, and failing, to defeat the final boss. It was the most astonishingly brutal JRPG boss I can remember fighting, and when I finally got that victory, it was a joy like no other. It sounds crazy, but the way I had to rethink and plan out my entire approach to that final battle actually <i>improved </i>my opinion of this sequel. Once again, I am smitten by Octopath Traveler and its style – but five years after the original, it doesn't hit quite as hard. So little has changed about its battles, and this sequel sticks a little too closely to the original systems without expanding on them too much. Especially now that the 2D/3D art style is an established look, the still lovely visuals just don’t stand out as much anymore. That said, the combat system is still quite fun, and figuring out the best course of action to exploit weak points, knock an enemy unconscious, and then unload on them with as much power as you can remains satisfying. I did also find myself more invested in the stories this time around, and the way it comes together in the end is more interesting and cohesive than the first. If you liked Octopath Traveler (or even any of the Bravely Default games) Octopath Traveler 2 is another good ol' fashioned 80-hour JRPG - it just feels like one I’ve played before. "
Like a Dragon: Ishin! ,7,"I had been under the impression that bringing a gun to a knife fight was strictly the Chicago way, but apparently it was the way of the samurai too – at least if the mix of gunslinging and sword-swinging in Like a Dragon: Ishin! is any indication. This 2023 remake of a 2014 Yakuza series spin-off that was previously only available to Japanese audiences transposes the tried and tested street fighting formula from modern Tokyo onto the final days of Japan’s Edo period, replacing the weaponised traffic cones and potted plants with katanas and primitive pistols. It suffers somewhat as far as its substories and side activities go, with both not quite up to the standard set by subsequent releases, but a card-augmented combat system keeps the fighting fresh and the crime story plot is packed with more delicious pulp than a Nashi pear. Like a Dragon: Ishin! might not be on the cutting edge of the katana blade, but it rarely strays onto the dull side either. It appears you can take the Yakuza story out of the streets of modern Tokyo, but you can't take the modern gangsters out of the Yakuza story. The events of Like a Dragon: Ishin! may take place in 1860s Kyoto and feature characters loosely based on real historical figures, but most of the roles in its main cast are filled with a host of recognisable faces from other Yakuza games. Thus its protagonist Sakamoto Ryoma, a disgraced ronin out to avenge the murder of his adoptive father, is clearly just series stalwart, Kazuma Kiryu, right down to his permanent scowl and unwavering sense of justice. I must admit that even as a longtime fan it initially got a little confusing when Kazuma Kiryu playing Sakamoto Ryoma went undercover as Saito Hajime in order to infiltrate the Shinsengumi police force. Still, my fondness for him helped me buy into his plight almost immediately, and although Ishin’s story beats are similar to those featured in several other Yakuza games, setting its figurative (and literal) backstabbing against the backdrop of a potential Japanese civil war made the stakes feel higher than those surrounding the typical turf battles.  Unlike recent releases from developer Ryu Ga Gotoku that feature English voice casts like Yakuza: Like a Dragon and Lost Judgment, Ishin can only be played with the original Japanese audio with subtitles. That may be considered a negative to some, but personally I like experiencing these stories with dialogue delivered in the characters’ native tongue, and it seems even more appropriate in this case given that Ishin takes place at a time when Japan was still largely sheltered from Western influences. That said, even with the translated subtitles turned on, there are a great deal of period-specific references to regions, religions, and regiments that I found to be almost impenetrable early on. Constantly pausing dialogue in Ishin’s opening hours in order to consult the in-game glossary (along with Google) to help fill in the gaps did upset the rhythm of the storytelling somewhat, but over the course of my 30-hour playtime I learned to distinguish a goshi from a joshi, and ultimately came away feeling more enlightened about a crucial period in Japanese history that I previously knew very little about. I was less inspired by the environment itself, however. 19th century Kyoto’s woodland surroundings certainly make for a nice change of scenery from the bustling urban jungle of present day Tokyo, and much like Kamurocho it's arguably best experienced at night, trading neon-soaked streets littered with drunken locals for lantern-lit lanes littered with… well, also plenty of drunken locals. (It turns out sake has been making Japanese people feel jolly for well over a thousand years.) However, while Ishin’s small slice of Japan’s original capital city is not without its standout sections, such as the bustling marketplace lining the canals in the Fushimi district, there are also far too many bland back streets that make navigating your way around a bit less appealing. I found myself far more reliant on the trip-skipping palanquin service in Ishin than I ever made use of the taxi services in other Yakuza adventures. As with any other Yakuza game, the rustic riverside streets aren’t just meant for sightseeing, but also fight-spreeing, and Like a Dragon: Ishin! introduces a blend of blades and bullets that makes its combat feel refreshingly distinct from other entries in the series for the most part. Ryoma has four different fighting stances that you can switch between on the fly, allowing you to go from the smash and bash of the barehanded Brawler technique to the slash and dash of the Swordsman style with a tap of the D-pad. They vary in usefulness, though, and I found the pistol-only Gunman style to be particularly inconsistent in its implementation. It either made life too easy by allowing me to fill hallways of sword-swinging enemies with unlimited rounds of hot lead before they could get close enough to strike back, or its fickle auto-targeting would frustratingly force me to shoot at foes in the distance rather than the warrior in front of me threatening to clean out my ears with a sharpened spear.  I found the Wild Dancer style proved to be by far the most fun and reliable combat stance in Like a Dragon: Ishin!, and thus its skill tree is the one I invested in most heavily. Wild Dancer finds Ryoma at his most fleet-footed, composed of a combination of fast sword-slashes and a spinning blast of gunfire that’s excellent for crowd control, along with a twirling evade move that can be chained together to pinball him out of harm’s way and into a position of power. The fact that its faster attacks came at the cost of it dealing slightly less damage overall made it less effective against the more brutish bosses, but at that point I’d just smoothly switch to the deliberate and powerful Swordsman technique and indulge in a more steadily-paced samurai showdown. While I may have relied on only two of the four fighting stances available to me for the vast majority of the adventure, they still provided enough variety to entertain. That’s particularly when used in tandem with Ishin’s unique Trooper card system, which effectively allows for custom support loadouts for each of Ryoma’s fighting styles. I enjoyed experimenting with different decks of cards, from the more passive Troopers that provide boosts to your attack power and health, to far more outlandish assault cards like a chicken that lays egg-shaped proximity mines and even your own personal attack bear. There are hundreds of these Trooper cards to uncover in Ishin and each card can be leveled up in combat, fused with other cards, or even promoted to unlock more powerful abilities, bringing a welcome amount of depth and strategy – and a splash of welcome silliness – to what initially seems like a fairly straightforward action game on the surface. Ishin gives Ryoma plenty of opportunities to keep his sword sheathed, and one of the more substantial side activities sees him become the caretaker to a small farm in order to support a  local orphan named Haruka. It’s a pretty involved process – you must carefully arrange your vegetable crops to maximise your return on each harvest, invest in additions such as chicken coops and scarecrows to further increase the farm’s output, and then meet meal delivery requests by completing simple Cooking Mama-style mini-games in order to turn a profit. I’ll be honest, farming simulation is really not for me, and if I ever make a stop in Stardew Valley it will be merely to ask for directions to the nearest highway so I can hightail it out of there. Still, this farm is an entirely optional undertaking and it certainly provides a more chilled out change of pace to take a sharp blade to radishes instead of ronins, if that’s the sort of thing you’re after. iframe allow=""autoplay; fullscreen *"" allowautoplay="""" allowfullscreen=""true"" class=""gallery"" data-src=""/like-a-dragon-ishin/64390/gallery/embed"" frameborder=""0"" id=""gallery64390"" scrolling=""no""></iframe Considering I enter each Yakuza adventure with a cocked fist rather than a green thumb, I was far more invested in the 40 different dungeon crawling missions offered at the Shinsengumi barracks. These provide an opportunity for farming of a decidedly more violent variety, running blade-first through bandit hideouts in order to scavenge precious materials required to forge more powerful weapons at the blacksmith, as well as level up your trooper cards to be fighting fit ahead of the next story mission. The reused cave backdrop does start to feel somewhat samey, but the layouts, door switches, and trap and enemy placements are shuffled up consistently enough to make each gauntlet run feel distinct. Even after completing Ishin’s main story, I’ve returned to the barracks to mop up the remaining Shinsengumi dispatches that I missed on my way through because I find them so satisfying to complete. In comparing this 2023 release of Like a Dragon: Ishin! with the 2014 Japanese PlayStation 4 original, it’s clear that lighting and textures have been improved to bring it more in line with the more recent series entries on the surface, but it still shows its age somewhat with some stiff character animations and  loading screens that occasionally disrupt cutscenes and a lot of the transitions from exteriors to interiors. On the plus side, the Trooper card system was previously limited to the Shinsengumi side missions but can now be used throughout the adventure, which strikes me as a big benefit as far as keeping combat consistently fun. Even so, the bones of this 2023 version of Like a Dragon: Ishin! appear to be the same as the original, making it feel closer to a remaster than a substantial remake. Elsewhere a lot of the series’ side activity staples are present and accounted for, with various types of gambling including poker and chicken racing, karaoke, and dance mini-games just a few of the distractions to indulge in. There are some fun ye olde Yakuza spins on modern mini-games to be found, too – instead of smacking baseballs in a batting cage you get to slice cannon balls in half with a well-timed swing of your sword, for example – but the bulk of these archaic amusements just can’t compete with the more dazzling diversions to be found in the contemporary settings of other Yakuza and Judgment games. Trading Club Sega arcades and go kart races for fishing and woodchopping feels a bit like forgoing a fun night on the town for a sleepy weekend away at your grandparents’ place – it’s still enjoyable and not without its charms, but it doesn’t exactly get your heartrate up. The substories that can be stumbled upon are similarly lacking in any real surprises. In most Yakuza games you can’t make your way from A to B without taking an unexpected detour into WTF territory, but Ishin’s substories are mostly more conservative by comparison. There are some rare offbeat exceptions, and I was certainly amused when an errand to buy perfume for a young lady suddenly swerved into a frenetic chase sequence with a lustful salesman hot on my tail like a horny Pepé Le Pew, but for the most part these interactions with locals are pretty subdued compared to the more outrageous scenarios experienced elsewhere in the series. That said, although helping an old lady to find her way home is pretty uneventful (though certainly noble), it’s still worth doing since Ishin’s Virtue system rewards you for almost every interaction you have – whether it’s a substory, shopping at a store, or feeding a stray dog. The Virtue points you earn can be spent on everything from upgrading Ryoma’s sprinting stamina to expanding Haruka’s farm, so rarely does any task in Ishin go entirely unrewarded, no matter how innocuous it may seem. While its half-baked gunplay should probably have remained holstered, Like a Dragon: Ishin!’s stylish sword fighting and over-the-top Trooper card attacks successfully pair the Yakuza series’ brand of hysterical action with the historical fiction of its 19th century Japan setting. Unfortunately, its step back in time also presents a slight step down in quality for its substories and side activities, which have each been eclipsed in entertainment value by the other Yakuza and Judgment games in the years since Ishin’s original Japanese release, and the blander areas of its low-tech environment can’t quite compete with the flashy charms of Kamurocho when it comes to exploration. Even so, its high stakes story had me hooked throughout, and it was fascinating to get an insight into a period of Japanese history I knew very little about previously, albeit through a heavily fictionalized lens. No matter which way you slice it, Like a Dragon: Ishin! is an enjoyable and interesting spin-off from the Yakuza series, but not an essential one. "
Horizon Call of the Mountain ,7,"Horizon Call of the Mountain knows what its job is: to ride the popularity of Horizon Forbidden West and spearhead Sony’s new foray into virtual reality gaming, the PlayStation VR 2. It really goes for it by placing less of a focus on the expansive story of Forbidden West and much more on spectacle, often wowing with the sights it places in front of you. On that level it’s a remarkable technical showcase that lets you have a good deal of excitement when taking the handbrake off and handing you control of its exhilarating combat. It’s therefore a slight shame that it often operates at a much more relaxed pace, which does allow you to frequently take in the beauty of its world, but prevents itself from thrilling consistently from start to finish. When it does all click, though, and those heights are hit, a very fun time is there to be had. Similarly to how a Disneyland ride borrows from whichever film it's based on, Call of the Mountain takes the Horizon experience and condenses it into something much more bitesize while trying to keep the same flavour. This is exemplified best by the Pirates of the Caribbean-like opening, in which your peaceful river cruise is rudely interrupted by the likes of a soaring Stormbird and towering Tallneck dino-bot. It’s a real credit to the work that developer Firesprite has done in translating Guerrilla's original art design into something more impressive than any TV screen could do justice to – both in the stunning vistas this world offers and the trademark machines that populate it.  The first time you see the scale of some of these creatures really is a sight to behold, not only from the shift to true first-person perspective emphasizing their true size, but with their presence felt further thanks to the haptic feedback felt both in each controller and the headset itself: as you quite literally feel the ground shake with every step as these massive machines pass by. It’s a real showcase for the PS VR2 right off the bat, with huge spectacle blending with small detail – right down to the delicate ripples your fingers make in the water and the rude splashes made by the feet of giant machines. Blockbuster opening aside, over the course of its roughly six-hour campaign Call of the Mountain takes the essence of Horizon’s gameplay and boils it down into a much more manageable set of tools that works in VR. Rocky landscapes to explore, hostile machines to take down, puzzles to solve – it's all here. What’s notable, however, is that this is very much a linear experience that stands in sharp contrast to Zero Dawn or Forbidden West’s vast open worlds. An inquisitive mind is occasionally rewarded with fun side activities, such as stacking rock cairns or collectible archery targets to hit, but mostly you’ll be guided down a funneled path. This narrow approach naturally works well in VR, even if some of the inherent exploration that Horizon normally offers is lost. There are two movement options to choose from: a “gesture”-based system that moves you around when holding two buttons and imitating a walking motion with your arms, and a more traditional analog stick-based system. After trying both I opted for the former for most of my playthrough, despite both coming with their pros and cons. At first, the gesture system didn’t strike me as overly intuitive, but once I got to grips with it I preferred it simply because it made me feel far less nauseous when playing for long stretches (by which I mean about 30 minutes). I did, however, find myself switching to the analog sticks whenever entering combat, as the dodge mechanics associated with this moveset (a flick of the right stick) made for a much easier time. Everyone’s mileage on this will obviously vary based on your VR tolerances, so I’d recommend trying out both to see which suits you best. Now’s the time to say that if you suffer from any level of vertigo, this may not be the game for you. I’m not too terrible with real heights, but here I did start to feel a little queasy when looking down at some of the ludicrous distances I could fall from. There are quite a few opportunities for potential plummets as well, thanks to the sheer amount of climbing you’re asked to do. Climbing cliffs. Climbing vines. Climbing ice walls. Climbing rock faces by lodging dual pickaxes into them. Almost so much climbing that you may find yourself wanting to climb the walls of your house as well. Now, I wasn’t naive enough to think that a game called “Call of the Mountain” wouldn’t involve <i>some </i>climbing, but I was taken somewhat off guard when I found that it really is the majority of what you’ll be doing here, especially in the early hours. Climbing isn’t overly challenging, but honestly reaching for handhold after handhold gets quite dull after you’ve scaled your third or fourth outcrop. It does get slightly more interesting once tools such as the grappling Grabcaster are introduced, and the immersion of it all as the wind swirls around your ears and the excellent music swells as you reach the next peak is undeniable. Although some ascents offer slightly more excitement than others, I can honestly say I never found climbing to be consistently fun. It’s frustrating then, that it dominates much of what you’ll be doing in Call of the Mountain, in particular when compared to its much less frequent but infinitely more exciting combat sections. The PlayStation VR2 may seem pricey, given that it costs $150 more than the base PS5 Digital Edition console you’ll need to use it. Even so, it’s such a quantum leap over the original PSVR in terms of ease of use, visual quality, and immersion that any PlayStation owner who loves VR should upgrade as soon as possible. Its 4K HDR OLED screen and excellently tactile Sense controllers are the most obvious improvement, but plentiful quality-of-life changes and the raw horsepower of the PS5 set a new standard for how VR games should play and feel on console. The downside is that, like any new platform, its thin launch lineup makes its lack of backward compatibility with original PSVR games a significant problem, but one that will only improve as Sony and other developers roll out new games that take advantage of the PSVR2’s unique features. – Gabriel Moss, Feburary 16, 2023 Read the full <a href=""/playstation-vr-2/64397/review/playstation-vr2-review"">PlayStation VR2 review</a  Largely taking place in mini arenas, these gladiatorial battles against all manner of unfriendly machine are often the highlight of each mission. It’s where the immersion of it all really beds in as you briefly forget what era of Earth you’re living in and the rhythm of combat takes hold. Armed with the signature Horizon weapon of a bow and arrow, you’ll quickly find yourself aiming for enemy weak points using the PS VR2’s impressive eyeball tracking tech, and then quick-dodging out of the way of flying melee attacks before ducking and weaving your head out of the way of projectiles. It’s a set of combat options that gradually builds over time as well, as new ammo types are introduced and your arsenal expanded. As stronger foes present themselves, naturally more firepower is needed, and with it the levels of excitement to find increase – a thrilling fight against a colossal Thunderjaw being a particular highlight. Preparing yourself for encounters becomes increasingly more important as you build all sorts of elemental arrows in a pleasing crafting system that lets you manually attach arrowheads, explosives, and flights, thus further creating a tangible connection to the world. More gratifying than crafting arrows though is, of course, firing them – and in this regard Call of the Mountain has really nailed it. Now, my real-world archery experience may only stretch as far as giving it a go when 11 years old on a school trip, but in my expert opinion this feels pretty damn good. There’s a real pleasing “ping” to the way each arrow flies off of the bowstring and haptic feedback tickles your palm, and then an even greater thrill as it slams into whatever is unfortunate enough to be in its way and sets them aflame thanks to explosive Blaze. Unlike the climbing, it just never gets old to watch sparks fly and machine parts fall off as the fundamentally brilliant Horizon combat successfully makes its way into the virtual reality space. It’s a highly satisfying cadence that works really well in VR thanks to its enthralling but never overwhelming speed, but is also forgiving if you happen to get blindsided by a roaming Scrapper, for example. If you do manage to take some damage you can find a pocket of peace amongst the mayhem by going for a snack break and refilling your health bar by munching on some fruit. A health bar is smartly located on one of your hands (much like we saw in Half-Life: Alyx) meaning it’s never more than a quick glance away, like checking the time on a watch, and always in view when aiming down sights. All in all, the interface of Call of the Mountain is very cleverly implemented, making it feel like a tangible part of your character and not a series of distracting floating boxes that threaten to take you out of the beautiful world. Puzzles also pop up here and there and, again, serve as a welcome break from climbing. Did I mention there’s a lot of climbing? The problems are sometimes fun but never overly difficult, and once the novelty of actually physically picking up gears and slotting them into position myself wore out they became yet another minor obstacle on the way to the next combat encounter or story moment. That story is serviceable, but one that is definitely engineered in order to facilitate big moments and fun cameos rather than tell a layered tale itself the way the previous two Horizons have. Here you play as Ryas rather than Aloy – he’s a Shadow Carja rebel who must complete a series of tasks in order to atone for his crimes. His internal monologues are mercifully limited in a smart maneuver that allows you to experience this world first-hand yourself and not be distracted by voices in your head. Naturally, things escalate as the plot thickens, and the second half of the campaign becomes much more engaging than the first thanks to the action increasing in both quality and quantity. A personal highlight is the aforementioned Thunderjaw cat and mouse section, which conjures up memories of Jurassic Park at its rousing best. There are a few little nods scattered throughout for big Horizon fans to find of value here – familiar faces like Aloy drop in to say hello – but don’t necessarily come in expecting a dense new chapter in this universe’s lore. Outside the main story you’re free to explore your small home base, take a closer look at artifacts collected on your expeditions, and chat with friends made along the way. It’s also home to the pleasant safari mode: a largely tranquil alternative version of the opening boat cruise which shows off a selection of the Horizon bestiary in its natural habitat. It’s short, sweet, and a reflection of the Disneyland-like nature of Call of the Mountain as a whole – an impressive technical showcase for PS VR2 which uses the inherent wonders of the Horizon world to sprinkle thrills into its sometimes-lazy river ride.  Horizon Call of the Mountain’s exciting highs elevate it just enough above its often monotonous climbing mechanics to create a fun first blockbuster-scale entry into the PS VR2 library. Through intuitive design, awesome spectacle, and gripping combat, Horizon’s first step into virtual reality is one packed with exciting encounters that its slower stretches may sometimes detract from, but never threaten to derail completely. It’s an enjoyable, if not essential, chapter of the Horizon story. "
PlayStation VR2 ,9,"It’s a thrill when we get to say this about a new piece of gaming hardware: The PlayStation VR 2 is a true generational leap that makes the old one look like a piece of junk. It’s not exactly cheap, but for $549.99 you get a high-end headset with a 4K, HDR-enabled OLED screen, a 110-degree field of view, built-in tracking cameras, and eye tracking, plus two of its slick Sense controllers with the excellent adaptive triggers and haptic feedback Sony introduced with the <a href=""/playstation-5/41294/review/playstation-5-review"">PlayStation 5</a>’s <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-dualsense-controller-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">DualSense controller</a>. The catch is that it requires you to be connected to a PS5 by a single USB-C cable, but that means it’s much, much more powerful when it comes to delivering fantastic graphics than a self-contained headset like the <a href=""/review/39834/oculus-quest-2-review"">Meta Quest 2</a>. With all of that, including a few features you don’t see on even more expensive PC <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/best-vr-headset"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">VR headsets</a> like <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/28/valve-index-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Valve’s Index</a> and <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/hp-reverb-g2-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">HP’s Reverb G2</a>, the PlayStation VR2 has vaulted console VR into the lead in just about every category… except available games. The PlayStation VR2 is an immediate improvement over its predecessor in every way, but the physical design is actually pretty similar. Like its forebear, it’s got a clean black-and-white look that matches your PS5, and it’s built around an adjustable head strap that’s separated from the VR display itself, which does a great job of comfortably accommodating a wide range of head shapes and lets the weight of the screen rest on the top of your head rather than on your face. The one-stop adjustment mechanism on the back of the head strap remains an excellent way to dial in a perfect fit.  It’s nice to see the PS VR2 has a slider on the top-left side of the lens casing to quickly adjust the headset’s interpupillary distance, or IPD, and it’s especially neat that the internal camera quickly measures the distance between your eyes during setup. Other than that Sony has kept the headset itself simple, with just two buttons at the bottom of the display. The center button turns the headset on and off, and the other instantly activates passthrough mode, letting you see the real world around you in black and white without taking off the headset. This is great if you need to adjust your controllers or greet someone who’s entered your play area. That said, it’s slightly disappointing there are no physical buttons to adjust the volume. Everything else about the PS VR2 feels like a quantum leap over any other headset in its price class – save for the HP Reverb G2 which, up until now, has offered a level of fidelity only accessible to PC gamers. This is no longer the case, and the PlayStation VR2 is now the most affordable way to play PC-quality VR games at 4K resolution. Unlike the Reverb G2, however, the PS VR2’s display uses two HDR-enabled 2,000 x 2,040 per-eye OLED panels that operate at up to 120 Hz and offer a 110-degree FOV, rather than the G2’s slightly less glamorous dual 2,160 x 2,160 LCD panels that cap out at 90 Hz and a 98-degree FOV without any support for HDR. As a result, the PlayStation VR2 displays a picture that is smoother, richer, and deeper than anything else on the market today – save for, perhaps, the Meta Quest Pro which costs three times as much. Compared to the original PSVR, setup is a breeze. Instead of a whole bunch of cables and an HDMI switcher that was an absolute chore to deal with – to say nothing of the tracking camera – the PS VR2 has a single 4.5m USB-C cable you plug into your PS5, and… you’re done! After that you’ll need to install a firmware update and then quickly calibrate your controllers, eye tracking, and lens spacing, and the four tracking cameras will capture a scan of your room. It’s extremely cool to see it accurately map out the geometry of a room – and everything in it, including furniture, pets, and even the leftovers on your coffee table. Once you carve out a play area, the PS VR2’s guardian walls rise out of the ground, clearly marking which parts of your room are safe to walk around in. It’s easy to recalibrate or adjust your settings at any point from the main PlayStation 5 settings menu, and anyone familiar with the PS5’s control center won’t have a problem seamlessly navigating between the VR experience and the PS5’s main menu. Still, it’s neat that someone can stand outside of the PS VR2 headset and direct the experience remotely using a DualSense controller. This can make setup way simpler if you’re trying to show off the PS VR2 to someone who doesn’t usually spend time in VR or isn’t familiar with the PS5’s interface. Sony has managed to make its lower-priced PlayStation VR headset competitive where it counts. Despite its relatively low resolution it looks very good in games, and the headset is comfortable to wear and easy to use after you’ve dealt with its many wires. Paired with the Move controllers it provides good but sometimes flakey motion tracking on your hands, but the PlayStation Camera’s limited viewing angle is a weakness, and so is its inability to see behind you. Should you run out and buy one? That depends. The technology is astonishing but still in its infancy, and VR games that rival current console blockbusters are a long way off, so it won’t be as immediately useful as you might expect for a $400 to $500 price. However, it’s a lot of fun to be on the forefront of something as exciting as VR. Some of the best times I’ve had with my VR headsets are from wowing people who come over and try it for the first time, and that never gets old. –<i>Dan Stapleton, October 5, 2016</i Read the full <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">PlayStation VR review</a If you’ve only ever used the PSVR’s Move controllers, the moment you grab onto the included pair of Sense controllers is a revelation. The layout of their clicky face buttons and analog sticks will feel familiar to anyone who has played room-scale VR in the last several years, but they step things up with the addition of haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. The analog sticks are half the size of the DualSense’s, but remain tactile, allowing almost the same degree of precision as a D-Pad when playing a game of Tetris Effect: Connected, which is notoriously difficult to play on the Quest 2’s default Touch controllers. Each button also features capacitive touch that can tell if your fingers are on it or not, which allows you to make reasonably accurate gestures with your hands. It’s not quite as sophisticated as the finger tracking on the Valve Index controllers, though, so you’re limited to specific gestures like giving a thumbs up or pointing with your index finger. In games like Horizon Call of the Mountain and Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge, you can feel the power of drawing a virtual bowstring or shooting a virtual blaster through the resistance of the adaptive triggers. Haptic feedback improves this effect by simulating certain forces, textures, and noises through dynamic vibrations. This can be felt in everything from smashing a large shipping container with your Godzilla-sized tentacles in Tentacular to tackling an opponent in 2MD: VR Football Unleashed – but it’s at its most impressive when producing subtle but accurate vibrations for calmer interactions, such as gliding your paddle against the flow of water in Kayak VR Mirage, where you can almost feel the resistance of the water through the Sense controller’s haptic vibrations. Of course, just like with the DualSense, battery life is a concern here: with all that vibrating and resisting, a full charge only lasts around four to five hours. That’s a long time for a session of VR gaming, but the fact that you can’t swap out batteries for a fresh pair means you might get cut short if you forget to plug them in. Likewise, the Sense controllers’ ring design may take some getting used to – it can be difficult to figure out where your hands are supposed to go by touch, which adds a little hassle to the joy of introducing someone new to VR. But they’re comfortable to hold once you get a grip. In contrast to the OLED panel included in the original PSVR, the PS VR2’s 4K HDR OLED panel offers richer colors and up to a 120Hz refresh rate, making even less visually detailed games come to life. The screen door effect was never an issue with the PSVR, and it isn’t here either, but with proper IPD calibration, you can now tactically eliminate glare as well. The fact that you’re encompassed by 110 degrees of scenery at all times makes VR all the more lifelike. That’s 10 degrees wider than the original PSVR, and it’s a significant difference in how much of the world around you is visible. It’s still a bit like wearing a SCUBA mask, but it’s a bigger, less-claustrophobic SCUBA mask. Simply put, the PS VR2 is by far the most gorgeous headset in the $500 price range. The PS VR2’s access to the PS5’s graphical horsepower allows its games to have vast draw distances, much like their flatscreen counterparts, and there’s no better demonstration of this than in Horizon Call of the Mountain. You can see fully simulated mechanical creatures running around across the map, contrasted against cascading waterfalls and picturesque mountaintops reflecting light in the distance. Similarly, Cities VR: Enhanced Edition allows you to build urban sprawls that truly come alive from a distance – and now you can see all of it, all at once. On top of that, the PS VR2 has a fancy new trick called foveated rendering, which means its built-in IR camera tracks the movement of your eyes and uses that information to improve efficiency. Because it knows exactly what you’re focused on, it can put all its processing power into making that area super detailed, while everything else can be dialed down to conserve resources. It’s also neat that certain games can now allow you to select menu options with your eyes, or toggle interactions just by glancing at a character. The only other headset available right now that can do this is the Meta Quest Pro, and that’ll cost you $1,500. Horizon Call of the Mountain’s exciting highs elevate it just enough above its often monotonous climbing mechanics to create a fun first blockbuster-scale entry into the PS VR2 library. Through intuitive design, awesome spectacle, and gripping combat, Horizon’s first step into virtual reality is one packed with exciting encounters that its slower stretches may sometimes detract from, but never threaten to derail completely. It’s an enjoyable, if not essential, chapter of the Horizon story. –<i>Simon Cardy, February 16, 2023</i Read the full <a href=""/horizon-call-of-the-mountain/64395/review/horizon-call-of-the-mountain-review"">Horizon Call of the Mountain review</a Another nice touch you don’t see on the other popular VR sets is built-in headset vibration, which adds a new layer of immersion to gameplay when implemented at the right moments. For example, roving dinosaurs in Jurassic World Aftermath and explosions in Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy’s Edge both generate haptic vibrations that pulse through the headset, coinciding with the distance, position, and intensity of the sounds they produce. It can bring the cinematic details out of sound design in games that implement it skillfully, but you really want proper 3D audio on top of the haptics in order to get the full experience, which means the disappointing packed-in earbuds don’t cut it quite as well as something like Sony’s own <a href=""/sony-pulse-3d-wireless-headset/41282/review/sony-pulse-3d-wireless-headset-review"">Pulse 3D wireless headphones</a>. Unfortunately, you’re out of luck if you’re hoping any of this will work with your existing PSVR game catalog. Because of how big an improvement it is, PS VR2 represents a clean slate for PlayStation’s entire VR library, so even if you’ve spent hundreds of dollars on PSVR games that made the list of PS VR2 games in the launch window, you’ll have to buy them again (though a few publishers have announced free PS VR2 upgrades for existing PSVR games). And considering that there just aren’t a ton of new games announced yet, it might be a while before the PS VR2 catches up to other platforms in terms of selection. But hey, it has <a href=""/beat-saber/25628/review/beat-saber-review"">Beat Saber</a>, and what more do you really need? The PlayStation VR2 is initially available through <a href=""https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/playstation-vr2"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">PlayStation Direct</a> for $549.99 with two Sense controllers, a single USB-C cable, and auxiliary earbuds. PlayStation Direct currently offers a $599.99 bundle containing Horizon Call of the Mountain at a $10 discount.  The PlayStation VR2 may seem pricey, given that it costs $150 more than the base PS5 Digital Edition console you’ll need to use it. Even so, it’s such a quantum leap over the original PSVR in terms of ease of use, visual quality, and immersion that any PlayStation owner who loves VR should upgrade as soon as possible. Its 4K HDR OLED screen and excellently tactile Sense controllers are the most obvious improvement, but plentiful quality-of-life changes and the raw horsepower of the PS5 set a new standard for how VR games should play and feel on console. The downside is that, like any new platform, its thin launch lineup makes its lack of backward compatibility with original PSVR games a significant problem, but one that will only improve as Sony and other developers roll out new games that take advantage of the PSVR2’s unique features.

Deliver Us Mars ,6,"Just before my group of four young astronauts with major, personal conflicts of interest blast off to the red planet, I'm assured by our team leader that, while some corners had to be cut to get our ship spaceworthy, it should do its job just fine. And it does… kind of. Which is a great metaphor for Deliver Us Mars as a whole. This platforming, puzzle-solving, interplanetary adventure is trying to do too much with too little, and it ends up touching down just North of adequate. The backstory for our plucky, rebellious, sometimes even endearing hero, Kathy, is that she was separated from her father Isaac just before he boarded a colonization mission bound for Mars. Years later, she's been through astronaut school on a climate-ravaged Earth and a mysterious transmission from Isaac spurs her and her older sister, Claire, to seek seats on the mission to bring the colony ships back. Periodic flashbacks do a respectable job of filling in the complicated and painful story of their family along the way.  The launch sequence from Cape Canaveral is among the strongest. It has you perform various checks and landing procedures that feel authentic and tactile before watching through the front window as your ship, the Zephyr, leaves Earth's atmosphere with no cuts or loading screens. You're not briefed on any of these procedures ahead of time, which led to a lot of me swiveling my mouse pointer around frantically trying to find the highlighted switch for the internal power interval or whatever, but it was neat once I got the hang of it. Outside these scripted sequences, Deliver Us Mars consists of first- and third-person explorations of an orbital facility and the surface of Mars itself, featuring some fairly simple puzzle-solving and occasional, frustrating platforming. There are several sections where you have to bounce wireless power beams around, matching the voltage on doors and terminals to get to the next area. They're generally not too difficult, but I found some of the trickier ones satisfying to solve. What wasn't nearly as satisfying were these obnoxious climbing wall segments. You have to click the left and right mouse button at the same time to grab onto a wall to begin with, and you have to do so with enough room that you don't slide off of the climbing surface. But this action is so unresponsive that whether you can get a purchase or not feels more random than anything, especially in some cases where you have to jump at an angle. Also, one of the moves you need to progress in some of the later segments is never explained at all, and I discovered it by accident when I was just trying out random buttons in frustration after I'd been stuck for several minutes. Pro tip: You can hold S and press spacebar to jump to a wall that's behind you. This lack of direction even extends to some segments of the main story where you have several different ways you can go, but aren't told at all which is the right one and can end up wandering way off in the wrong direction. There is an option under Accessibility to always display quest markers, and while I don't necessarily need a big star constantly guiding my every step, it could really use some sort of middle ground. If you tell me to go to Ark Vita without ever giving me a hint about where it is, that seems like you're really leaving me to twist in the wind. At least the characters are endearing. What few of them there are, anyway. Neil Newborn (whom you may remember as Resident Evil: Village's maniacal Heisenberg) gives a great performance as Isaac, a complex character with conflicted motivations. Kathy herself is brought to life by Ellise Chappell, who gives a convincing performance with a wide emotional range. And the story is respectable, with the mystery of what happened to the Martian colonists pulling me forward at each turn. The character models can't really keep up with it, though. They have a very doll-like, uncanny valley look to them – when we get to see their faces at all. A lot of backstory is delivered through these pre-recorded holograms where hairless, faceless crash test dummies pose in place while dialogue plays. It really looks like placeholder art you'd see in an unfinished game, and the developers just never had the time or resources to replace it. There is also a whole chapter toward the end that jumps from one scene to something completely unrelated, giving me the sense that they cut a significant amount of plot without doing a very good job of stitching it back together. Performance, especially during cutscenes, is also a major issue. My RTX 3080-powered system exceeds the recommended specs, but in many cinematics I would see my framerate drop below 10 fps, even with DLSS on. I had to turn off the per-strand hair rendering altogether because it kept glitching out. In regular gameplay, it's usually fine. But this is clearly not a very well-optimized project. A rousing mystery brought to life by a great voice cast and nuanced character writing can't really save Deliver Us Mars from its shortcomings. Poor technical performance during cutscenes and backstory that is too often delivered by these barely-differentiated mannequins make it difficult to get sucked into this extraterrestrial world. Even when it’s running smoothly, frustrating climbing and platforming mechanics are just a chore to get through so that you can reach the more clever puzzles and rewarding exploration that break up the annoyances with moments of wonder and satisfaction. But I could never shake the feeling that Deliver Us Mars simply bit off more dehydrated astronaut food than it could chew. "
Wild Hearts Review in Progress,8,"Do you dream of the chance to get dropkicked by a lava-monkey the size of a building? Of course you do, and goodness gracious is Wild Hearts excited to make that dream a reality. Omega Force and EA’s take on co-op monster hunting is a remarkably familiar one, mixing on-the-fly building mechanics into enormous elemental animal fights across its gorgeous feudal Japanese locations. But even when its crystal clear inspirations can sometimes lead to comparisons that aren’t always flattering for Wild Hearts, the few dozen hours I’ve spent with it so far have been a ton of fun, and I’m excited to keep grinding for materials as I progress toward the end of its campaign and into the endgame. Let me be perfectly blunt: it’s nearly impossible to talk about Wild Hearts without bringing up Monster Hunter. That’s not to say this is an egregious rip-off or completely unoriginal, as it provides plenty of interesting additions and fun little twists all its own. But in pretty much every way that counts, Wild Hearts is <i>so fundamentally Monster Hunter</i> that you could very easily mistake it for the newest game in Capcom’s series if it weren’t for the name. That’s true of its giant monster-slaying missions, its crafting-based equipment progression with drastically different weapon types, its campaign structure continuously escalating and remixing previous encounters, and even its fine but ignorable story of a hub town investigating why local creatures have unexpectedly started attacking outside of their usual territory.  Importantly, Wild Hearts at least plays this recognizable part very well, making it one of the easiest recommendations I could make to any current Monster Hunter fan looking for new prey. Its combat captures that excellent mix of tactical and terrifying, pushing you to pick your moments carefully against foes many times your size who can often make your health bar disappear in the blink of an eye. It’s as much about learning the ins and outs of each monster, your weapons, and even the terrain around you as it is about actually executing the right button inputs. But because Wild Hearts is not <i>actually </i>a Monster Hunter game, it gets to leave behind certain legacy mechanics that have started to feel a little dated as <a href=""/monster-hunter-world/9702/review/monster-hunter-world-review"">Monster Hunter World</a> and <a href=""/monster-hunter-rise-nintendo-switch/44727/review/monster-hunter-rise-review"">Monster Hunter Rise</a> continue to streamline and modernize that two-decade-old series. I didn’t miss things like weapon sharpening or cluttered inventory management, and the simplified nature of stuff like stat-boosting food and support items means I feel like I’m spending more time out in the field and less on pre-hunt prep. So far Wild Hearts also seems to have lost some of the complexity I enjoy about Monster Hunter along with those clunkier parts, but this ground-up approach means it’s far easier to recommend to brand-new hunters, too. The biggest way Wild Hearts sets itself apart is in its karakuri building system, which allows you to both create tactical objects like walls or springboards in the middle of combat as well as place structures like fast-travel tents or ziplines anywhere across its four hunting maps. This system is excellent, with the number of structures you can build limited enough to make me really consider where best to build a custom base camp or a convenient shortcut while still being flexible and open enough that I never had to overthink it, either. It turns the wonderfully detailed maps into little puzzles to be solved in whatever way you see fit, rather than simply arenas to fight in. During those fights, karakuri play the role of quick-use support items – though everything you place sticks around until it’s destroyed (either by you or a monster), so battlefields can often be strewn with the remnants of past encounters in a pretty neat way. You can summon simple blocks to jump off of or build walls, springs to launch you in any direction, or torches to give you a fast fire attack. It’s an interesting mechanic, but it really shines when you start unlocking fusion karakuri, which let you stack these basic objects in specific patterns to make special constructs like huge bombs or chain traps. This ends up feeling like a mini combo system to master, and adds some nice consistency across all the weapon types. Outside of those karakuri, each of the eight different weapons play <i>very</i> differently from one another. There are your simple-to-understand options like a middle-of-the-road katana, giant but slow hammer, or… well, literally just a gun. But there are also a couple of unique choices like the quick, bladed umbrella that’s built around parrying attacks. Wild Hearts’ combat is always a fun dance of reading attack patterns and timing both strikes and dodges well, but it was also a little daunting until I found the weapon that clicked with me: the Claw Blade. This fast-slicing knife also lets you pretty much fly through the air after hooking onto a monster, making for some absolutely epic moments as you strike from above. The monsters themselves are all pretty fun to fight too, with their cool and creative designs each boiling down to “normal animal plus elemental type multiplied by <i>big</i>.” Fights can be a real challenge when you’re playing solo (which is how I’ve spent most of my time so far, since the pre-launch server population is low), and it’s always satisfying to learn their behaviors and turn an initially hard encounter into something trivial through practice and grinding alone. My main issue at this point is that the amount and variety of monsters seems pretty low, with different elemental variants or just stronger “Mighty” versions being introduced almost right away. Those don’t look <i>that </i>different or feel like totally new enemies to fight, so while I’m still having fun for now, I could see it wearing thin if things aren’t shaken up down the line. That’s also a symptom of Wild Hearts’ structure, with a campaign that is quick to put you up against a foe it’s confident you won’t be able to beat without preparation. That means collecting monster parts to craft new armor or upgrading your weapons through a sprawling tech tree. It’s another very familiar system, but so far there’s less to tinker with here to eek out little advantages than I’m accustomed to as a Monster Hunter veteran – you can’t increase the armor rating of a piece of equipment individually, just make new pieces, and the only way to customize weapons is through a small handful of perks they can inherit as you upgrade them. That means these difficulty spikes incentivize you to grind for armor and weapons tailored toward beating the gatekeeping monster specifically, which is a lot less empowering than finding the direction that most interests me and crafting a build that makes it work. That all said, I have a lot more Wild Hearts left to play, and right now I am excited to do so. Its equipment systems seem simpler than that of Monster Hunter, but that can be both a good thing and a bad thing, so only time will tell if it’s worth digging deep into. I also hope its monster variety gets more meaningful as I go further, but I’m far from bored yet with what I’ve seen already. All that’s left is to keep hunting and see what the campaign (and the endgame) have in store for me, and I’ll be back with a final scored review for its launch on the February 16 once I have.  If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Koei Tecmo’s Omega Force is using Wild Hearts to flirt hard with Capcom right now. But using a beloved game as the template for a new one isn’t necessarily a bad thing, and Wild Hearts manages to introduce plenty of fun new ideas to the Monster Hunter formula while recapturing it well enough to stand proudly alongside the series that so clearly inspired it. The way it simplifies and streamlines things makes for a slightly shallower package, but its karakuri building adds a fresh new way to interact with the map in its place. And while its lower monster variety is certainly disappointing, I’m still having enough fun that I’m excited to party up with some friends and dive back into both challenging endgame fights and fanciful karakuri decorations alike.

Hogwarts Legacy ,9,"Like many, I’ve been waiting for a truly excellent Harry Potter game since I was in the third grade. In that time, we’ve gotten some respectable <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/06/29/lego-harry-potter-years-1-4-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">LEGO Potter games</a>, an underwhelming EA Sports Quidditch game for some reason, and even suffered through the fevered nightmare that is <a href=""https://www.ign.com/videos/harry-potter-for-kinect-launch-trailer"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Harry Potter Kinect</a>. But none of these has come close to fulfilling that fantasy of receiving a Hogwarts admission letter that opens the door to a secret world. With Hogwarts Legacy, I’m happy to say that we finally got a Harry Potter game that captures some of that magic. Its open world map absolutely nails the vibe of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, it has spellcasting combat that’s stupefyingly good, the characters that inhabit it are charming and unforgettable, and it is positively brimming with countless diversions to soak up dozens of hours of your time. It may not be the most impressive technical achievement and it is certainly cursed with a lack of enemy variety, but none of Hogwarts Legacy’s issues can cast a Descendo charm on this triumphant visit to the Wizarding World.   Right in line with most Harry Potter tales before it, Legacy’s plot has more holes than a fishnet stocking and sorta just expects you to accept that its magical world makes no sense. This mystical third-person action-adventure RPG begins with you transferring to Hogwarts as a fifth-year witch or wizard (for unexplained reasons) to do everything from attending classes to fighting giant spiders with a magical stick to flying around on a hippogriff. The fantastic character creator has plenty of options for you to craft your ideal witch or wizard (apart from a fairly limited voice selection), and as soon as you do they’ll immediately become entangled in a conflict between the Wizarding World and an evil goblin. On top of that, because being in a secret society of wizards is apparently not exciting enough, you soon discover that you’ve got some freaky super-charged magical abilities that allow you to do extra cool stuff that also isn’t really explained. If you’re like me, you’ll roll your eyes during moments when you’re introduced to 100 years’ worth of dead characters lecturing you from paintings about the importance of some stuff that happened a long time ago and how you have to save the world or whatever. But once that’s over with Legacy mostly redeems itself with a fantastic cast of non-painting characters that help boil things down into a not-too-convoluted good-guys-versus-bad-guys conflict that ends up being an enjoyable tale, even if it's not particularly profound or original. The characters you’ll spend most of your time with are the classmates who will befriend you on campus, accompany you on certain quests, and help you hone your abilities as a magic user. Most are memorable and instantly endearing, like Sebastian the cocky and morally pliable Slytherin, or Natsai the clever and unflappable Gryffindor, and spending time with them and improving your social links through their relationship questlines made my stay at Hogwarts all the more enjoyable. The elephant in the room with Hogwarts Legacy is Harry Potter’s creator, J.K. Rowling, whose <a href=""https://www.glamour.com/story/a-complete-breakdown-of-the-jk-rowling-transgender-comments-controversy"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>comments about transgender people</u></a> in recent years have <a href=""/harry-potter-and-the-sorcerers-stone/61368/news/daniel-radcliffe-felt-he-needed-to-say-something-for-lgbt-youth""><u>left a sour taste</u></a> in the mouths of <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/how-harry-potter-fans-are-coping-with-jk-rowling"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>many current and former Potter fans</u></a>, both at IGN and in the world at large. This has driven some to call for a boycott of the Wizarding World altogether – including Hogwarts Legacy, though Rowling was <a href=""/news/39765/hogwarts-legacy-jk-rowling-not-directly-involved-with-harry-potter-rpg""><u>not directly involved</u></a> and there are <a href=""/hogwarts-legacy/63794/news/portkey-games-addresses-hogwarts-legacys-transgender-character"">good reasons</a> (both <a href=""/news/44158/harry-potter-rpg-hogwarts-legacy-will-reportedly-allow-for-transgender-characters""><u>in-game</u></a> and <a href=""/hogwarts-legacy/63385/news/hogwarts-legacy-developers-respond-to-controversy-around-creators-anti-transgender-views""><u>out</u></a>) to believe the developers at Avalanche don’t necessarily share her views. Regardless, IGN has always and will continue to champion human rights causes and support people speaking with their wallets in whatever manner they choose. As critics, our job is to answer the question of whether or not we find Hogwarts Legacy to be fun to play and why; whether it’s ethical to play is a separate but still very important question. So just as in virtually all cases, we’re choosing to expose and address the views of the franchise creator separately from our consideration of the work of the hundreds of game developers and evaluate Hogwarts Legacy as it stands, leaving behind-the-scenes context to be considered <i>in addition</i> to that evaluation, rather than in place of it, so that it can be weighted according to your own values. Unexpectedly, I even found myself looking forward to hanging out with my professors, whether it was my main man Professor Fig, who serves as both something of a mentor and as a sidekick, or the wise-cracking charms teacher Professor Ronen, who made me love him mostly by making fun of me. Each of these characters feels like an indispensable piece of the school, and you can find them wandering the halls doing their thing and choose to spend time with your favorites. It’s a huge and important part of the Hogwarts fantasy that Legacy just knocks out of the park. Even better, though, is the world itself, which is just packed with nearly everything I wanted in a Potter game and more. You’ll find yourself exploring Hogwarts’ stone-cobbled halls and secret passageways, flying around the Forbidden Forest on a broomstick, and exploring dark caves lit only by the glow of your Lumos spell. The developers at Avalanche have so brilliantly captured the look and feel of the Wizarding World that I was amazed at just being there, no matter what trivial errand they had me wrapped up in. That immersion can occasionally be broken by Legacy’s dicey performance, though, which suffered from just about every issue that makes IGN’s performance review team cry during my time playing on PlayStation 5. Those greatest hits include framerate inconsistency, weird issues where the lighting switches from too dark to too bright, aggressive pop-in while moving around the map quickly, and more. There’s even this weird thing where every door in Hogwarts has a brief loading screen. It’s understandable since there’s so much packed into this beast of an adventure, but the PS5’s promises of the death of loading screens haven’t quite been lived up to here as it’s clearly struggling to keep up with the spellcraft and whimsy of the Wizarding World.  Beyond the performance issues, Legacy is also a fairly glitchy adventure in general. You’ll probably fall through the map a time or two, or see a character or object get caught in the environment, or maybe even have the person you’re talking to just up and walk away from you in the middle of a conversation, leaving you to speak with the empty spot they were standing in for about two minutes. I didn’t encounter anything game-breaking or so common that you’ll likely want to curse its name, but things like this do happen enough to be an irritation. As someone who finds the wand-whipping combat in the movies fairly dull, I was very concerned about Hogwart Legacy’s ability to keep my attention after slinging spells for dozens of hours, but I can admit when I’m wrong – the combat is fantastic, challenging, and utterly captivating. There’s a lot more to it than shooting balls of light out of a stick! Instead, the trick is in dodging and countering enemy attacks while pulling off creative combos. For example, you can pull enemies towards you with Accio, light them on fire with the close-range Incendio, then blow them away with the explosive Bombarda spell. Chaining together abilities to make your opponents look like complete fools never stops being amusing, especially as you unlock talent tree perks that enhance your skills with modifiers that make your elemental spells fork to nearby enemies or transform into AoE attacks. Many of the combat encounters are legitimately challenging too – I’ll admit I died my fair share of times while trying to show off a new set of spells or neglecting to see the goblin sneaking up behind me. Improving your skills and figuring out which spells work best for you is a really entertaining process, filled with experimentation and the occasional maiming. There’s even a perfect parry mechanic, which begs to be mastered by tryhards like me looking for that extra dopamine hit that comes from a timely block at the last possible second. You’ll also be forced to change up your tactics regularly, since many enemies have color-coded shields that can only be broken by spells of a particular type. For example, enemies with a red shield won’t be damaged until you hit them with a fire-based spell, which means you’ll need to keep a few of those handy. While the combat system never stops being entertaining, the creatures you fight soon run out of tricks up their sleeves. You’ll see the same familiar faces a lot, as you spend an enormous amount of your time fighting dark wizards, spiders, and goblins. Every once in a while they’ll trot out the same repeated troll enemy or nondescript magical suit of armor as well, but the enemies Legacy throws at you wear thin pretty quick. That’s a shame, since the Harry Potter universe is known for having all manner of beasts and villains to face off against, and yet here there’s practically no variety. What’s especially weird is that it’s not like there aren’t other enemy types to be found in Legacy – you’ll find giant, evil frogs and zombies roaming about, to name a few – it’s just that they’re scarcely used in any of the main dungeons or levels. Instead, they send about 500 spiders at you in a row, which is a baffling decision. Because you can only have so many spells equipped at any time, the one part of combat that’s a bit of a drag is the somewhat clunky process for switching between, which takes some serious getting used to. You learn quite a number of spells by the end of the roughly 30+ hour campaign and constantly have to reslot which ones you’ve got equipped; keeping them organized and committed to memory becomes a challenge in its own right, and not the kind I relish. When you’re not lighting spiders on fire, you’ll need some lighter activities to spend your time with, and it’s actually kind of crazy just how many side tasks Legacy gives you! You could spend hours decorating your very own personal space in the Room of Requirement; go around catching, grooming, and breeding all manner of fantastic beasts (if you know where to find them); practice your gardening or potion making; go shopping in Hogsmeade; become a champion duelist in an underground dueling ring with your classmates; or even go full Voldemort and decide you want to become a master of the Dark Arts by learning the Killing Curse and other unspeakable acts (which goes about as well as you’d expect if you choose to pursue it). It’s not just easy to waste dozens of hours goofing off – I found it downright difficult to <i>not</i> get distracted by a dozen things and forget what I’d originally set out to do. I was able to get through the main story in 32 hours, but even though I was in something of a hurry to complete it I found staying on task almost impossible. As soon as I finished I immediately went back to do more side quests and continue exploring (which you can do freely after finishing, since there doesn’t appear to be a New Game+ mode currently). I will say though, with the wizarding buffet of endless ways to waste your time, it’s a pretty glaring omission that Quidditch is nowhere to be found. The lore reason for a lack of the iconic broom-based sport is that it’s been banned for one year thanks to some pureblood wimp who got injured last year, but that feels like an effort to paper over the absence of a major aspect of Harry Potter’s time at Hogwarts that the developers must’ve just not had time to include.  One of the ways you can completely forget about the looming goblin threat in the main story is by engaging in the over 100 side quests that are packed into the adventure. Not all of these diversions are equally entertaining – some are definitely your basic “go here and kill/collect this thing” errands that do little more than burn some time – but many feature one of the aforementioned awesome characters asking for you to solve their problems or help them get into good ol’ fashioned mischief. Those are especially great reasons to slow down and immerse yourself in this world, like when you go to class to learn how to pot plants that try to eat you or help a classmate who’s getting picked on. Legacy just gives you lots of reasons to drink in the experience of being a student at Hogwarts, and the novelty of that doesn’t wear off even when you’ve been sent on some meaningless fetch quest. It also helps that you’re often appropriately rewarded for your efforts, whether that’s earning some gear to upgrade your stats, cosmetic items to improve your swagger, or best of all: new spells, the ultimate carrot in a game where you're often limited only by what magic you know how to cast. For example, one sidequest gives you the Alohomora spell, which – in classic Metroidvania fashion – allows you to literally unlock doors and get into places previously inaccessible to you. Collecting spells goes a long way to opening up the map and giving you a better bag of tricks during combat, and I found myself positively thirsting for as many of these game-changing abilities as I could get my grubby paws on. The gear that you’ll find doesn’t really allow you to create full-on “builds” per say, but you’ll gain some resistances and buffs to your character and can spend some time upgrading and modifying your best items for minor improvements. None of it is particularly game-changing stuff, but it managed to capture my attention enough for me to spend a good chunk of time looking at my equipment. Of course, the real loot game is about the cosmetics, a fact that Legacy seems to be keenly aware of since they find ways to hide cool-looking clothes all over the place. These items don’t have any gameplay impact, but pimping out my Slytherin legend to outshine all the kids from the lesser houses is more than enough of a motivation. Best of all, you can overwrite the appearance of any gear you’ve got equipped with the look of anything you’ve acquired so far, which is just fantastic.  However, if you’re as much of a loot hoarder as I am and were hoping to gather up all the treasures in the world and dump them in a closet like in Skyrim you’ll be painfully disappointed by Legacy’s abysmal inventory space, which only lets you hold a couple dozen items and aggravatingly fills up in no time at all. This means you’ll miss out on tons of items early on unless you go to your menu and decide which precious treasure to throw overboard every time you open a chest. Later on you can upgrade your inventory ever so slightly, but even then it never stops being a major pain in the cockatrice to juggle your inventory all the time. In nearly every way, Hogwarts Legacy is the Harry Potter RPG I’ve always wanted to play. Its open-world adventure captures all the excitement and wonder of the Wizarding World with its memorable new characters, challenging and nuanced combat, and a wonderfully executed Hogwarts student fantasy that kept me glued to my controller for dozens of hours. It’s certainly weighed down by technical issues, a lackluster main story, and some poor enemy variety, but even those couldn’t come close to breaking its enchanting spell over me. "
Hi-Fi Rush ,9,"The last thing I expected from developer Tango Gameworks was a vibrant, fun-loving action game with the heart of a cartoon I would’ve absolutely loved. The studio’s primarily known for the dark and creepy likes of <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/the-evil-within-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Evil Within</a> or <a href=""/ghostwire-tokyo/54880/review/ghostwire-tokyo-review"">Ghostwire: Tokyo</a>, but Hi-Fi Rush is instead filled with a joyous, youthful personality seen in its stunning animation, art style, and characters. And while the surprising change of pace is already refreshing, Tango’s greatest accomplishment is how it expertly executes on the singular concept that permeates Hi-Fi Rush’s design — that rhythm is everything. Right from the jump, Hi-Fi Rush establishes its reverence for modern garage and alt-rock, kicking things off by using The Black Keys’ “Lonely Boy” to introduce the cheesy but endearing protagonist Chai and the colorful, high-tech industrialized world he lives in. Labeled a “defect” by robotics megacorp Vandelay Industries after a surgical mishap leaves him with an iPod stuck in his chest, Chai can see and feel the pulse of his music coursing through the world around him. From that point on, nearly everything is impressively tied to the rhythm of Hi-Fi Rush’s soundtrack as this boyish goofball bashes Vandelay robots with a makeshift sword in the shape of a Gibson Flying V.  This playful setup sets a strong tone, and things only get better from there as Hi-Fi Rush layers on a fantastic crew of allies, charismatic villains, and bombastic fights — and often wrapped in a poignant satire of our tech dystopia. It's done with effortless humor and some genuinely warm moments. From so many angles, Hi-Fi Rush is able to showcase its uniquely charming spirit. At its best, Hi-Fi Rush’s combat creates a unique harmonious flow where music is your guide every step of the way. Chai always executes his attacks on the beat regardless of your own input timing, but keeping in rhythm with the BGM’s BPM rewards you with extra damage rather than punishing any missed notes. Using a similar foundation as <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/06/devil-may-cry-5-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Devil May Cry</a> or <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/bayonetta-3-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bayonetta</a>, each combat encounter across the roughly 10-12 hour campaign is graded on completion speed, elegance, and the ability to stay on beat with combos, but that constant tie to the music results in a type of satisfaction I just don’t get from other stylish-action games. This rhythmic system leaves no ambiguity in combo timing and paces itself in a way that allows for room to consider each follow-up move. Deciding whether I should use a light or heavy attack to mix up my combo string, a dodge or parry in anticipation of incoming hits, the grappling hook to close the gap on targets, or a summon to have a companion break shields or stun enemies never felt overwhelming since I could just pace myself to the music. It doesn’t linger on any one concept or gimmick for too long either, steadily throwing in new ideas to toy with before bringing them all together to test my mastery, which meant I never felt like I was simply hammering away to a basic 4/4 time signature. Every enemy’s attack pattern also plays by the same rules. Whether it be charge-ups, AoEs, sword slashes, or projectiles, the rhythm let me confidently avoid telegraphed attacks and approach them like a dancing rhythm game. Sometimes that inspiration even becomes more explicit – tougher foes and some bosses break into brief standalone rhythmic quick time event minigames that require a sequence of parries to counter their last-ditch efforts and deliver a final blow. The rhythm game die-hard in me got hyped every single time I had to do this, and getting perfect strings of parries left me nodding in satisfaction. In fact, one boss fight solely based on this concept is still my favorite encounter, even after some bombastic battles with dazzling spectacles in the late-game. My natural ability to <i>clap on two and four</i> wasn’t enough to get past Hi-Fi Rush’s tougher battles. Enemies gradually evolve in complexity with different offensive styles, and things can get chaotic in encounters that mix and match enemy types. The targeting system did leave me in precarious positions on occasion – since there’s no manual lock-on, I’d sometimes hook onto or gravitate towards enemies I didn’t intend to target, leaving me vulnerable or swinging at the wrong foe. That can become a problem when Hi-Fi Rush layers on flame-wielding robots and electrified floors, for example, but it works well-enough for most fights. Thankfully, with all the tools at my disposal, I could overcome any moments of frustration by changing my approach or at least playing it safer. Because music is the driving force behind Hi-Fi Rush’s design, anything that syncs to the beat through audio cues is also represented with distinct visual cues. For example, powerful combo finishers called Beat Hits use colored circles to show their proper timing, while big incoming attacks leave AoE markers on the ground that change color to the beat to indicate when they’ll land. Additionally, you can activate an on-screen metronome at any point to help keep time more explicitly. I can’t be the judge of whether or not it’s enough from an accessibility standpoint, but those who may struggle with rhythm games or need assistance with the audio do have some options here, and it’s worth acknowledging the importance of including them and the effort put forth to level the playing field. The closer you look at Hi-Fi Rush’s world, the more you see how deep the rhythmic ethos runs. Chai’s footsteps, his snapping idle animation, the pulsing light rings on his robotic cat companion 808, the trees and rocks bouncing in the environment, and even building infrastructure all move to the groove – this level of meticulous detail shows the whole world is in on the action. No matter where you turn, someone or something is jamming out to the same song as you. That attention to detail is still one of the most impressive parts of Hi-Fi Rush, and it gives a sense of momentum into an already vivid world. Platforming and puzzle sections between the staged combat encounters operate on the same principles, with platforms and key objects retracting and moving to the same beat. There’s no mistake when it comes to timing – Hi-Fi Rush can’t pull any cheap tricks or hit you with inexplicable difficulty spikes when it always plays by the same rules. The beat establishes a ruleset and dance you understand, nailing the timing is about seeing the environment as an extension of the music. That said, for as slick as it is on a conceptual level, movement during platforming isn’t quite as fluid as it is during combat. The consequences aren’t dire for misjudging a jump, but the fact that you can do so fairly easily is still a minor but noticeable inconvenience. While the harmonious fusion of rhythm and action is an outstanding achievement, what makes Hi-Fi Rush truly memorable is seeing its charismatic crew and world come to life. Chai’s great as the goofy, irreverent everyman, but it’s the supporting cast that makes the journey feel whole. Peppermint is the slick badass who’s the brains behind the operation to take down Vandelay’s band of comically evil executives. She steals every scene she’s in, and in many ways, this story is more about her. 808 acts as a vessel for the squad to communicate, but she’s also an adorable little baby tiger who’ll steal your heart simply doing cat things. Macaron is the big softie whose adorable demeanor contrasts with his brute force capabilities. It’s a strong dynamic in a crew of lovable personalities shining brighter than the protagonist himself – sorry Chai, you’re cool but I wish I could take control of your cooler friends on this journey! Hi-Fi Rush breathes life into these characters with some of the best animation in games, period. Cutscenes let their personalities shine bright as they fight to the beat and express themselves in such charming fashion. They’re also critical to call in during battle, and I always loved seeing their partner attacks play out. The camera cuts for tandem special moves are sweet as hell, too. Juggling an air combo and finishing it off with Peppermint’s partner attack where she whips out a massive laser beam or Macaron’s ground pound never gets old. They’re also super effective against the toughest foes and it really sells the idea that taking down Vandelay is a team effort. My time with Hi-Fi Rush didn’t end after rolling credits. Upon finishing the main story, you’ll unlock Rhythm Tower, which is a fun series of continuous combat trials that get increasingly difficult. And you’ll get a chapter select, which is handy for accessing certain parts of levels that were previously locked. It’s a boon for me since I just wanted more reasons to keep playing and wrecking robots in tougher battles. Finishing up the mural at the hideout and earning songs for the jukebox were also neat incentives I was happy to chase down by completing in-game challenges. Part of me was bummed to finish the story, but these endgame perks are a treat. There are so many cute quirks that ensure they just don’t end up as supporting characters in the background and they naturally bounce off each other and the villains. Genuinely funny dialogue, impeccable comedic timing, and superb voice performances make warmhearted and laugh-out-loud moments possible. And that stayed consistent throughout the entire story, even bringing a tear to my eye as I marched towards the conclusion. There’s also an amalgamation of nerd culture references that surprisingly fit the tone and a bunch of clever little goofs and gags with some sobering satire of modern work culture and the tech industry within a capitalist dystopia. Hi-Fi Rush makes melding all these seemingly disparate elements look effortless. While Hi-Fi Rush is filled with tons of original music, licensed tracks are interspersed to define key moments and make for some sick needle drops, like Number Girl’s “Inazawa Chainsaw” coming on during an exciting getaway. These aren’t just licensed songs for the sake of having them either, because they also play by the rules of Hi-Fi Rush’s universe, layering on instrumentation and matching the beat of the world –  for example, Nine Inch Nails’ “1,000,000” and “The Perfect Drug” play for their respective bosses, only progressing through the whole song as you get deeper into the fight’s phases. Yet neither of those examples come close to the flawless implementation of The Prodigy’s electro-punk tune “Invaders Must Die”, genuinely invigorating me to tear through robotic hordes and barrel towards the end, or The Joy Formidable’s “Whirring” to really capture that bittersweet feeling. Between those moments of licensed spectacle, Hi-Fi Rush bounces off the beat of original tracks from composers Shuichi Kobori and Reo Uratani, which replicate the modern garage rock sound nicely. These songs tend to blend into the background; catchy enough to get me to tap my foot as I’m playing but mostly serving their purpose as a guide for combat and puzzle timing rather than standout songs of their own. Outside of one, I’m not sure if I can hum a melody or recall a specific song off the in-house tracklist. It may also be a symptom of having every other aspect of Hi-Fi Rush be outstanding that anything that’s simply “good” gets lost in the shuffle. However, that aforementioned stand out track comes from a late-game stage that, dare I say, gives me <i>Persona vibes</i>. Upbeat acid jazz with a Rhodes piano backed by sharp orchestral strings and funky guitars as I pull up to infiltrate a gaudy museum? Madarame, eat your heart out. I thought to myself, I’ve been waiting for this – an original, evocative song to perfectly frame the moment. Every layer of this intoxicating track blast in combat, but they revert nicely to a toned down version in exploration and build up additional elements the further you get in the stage; it’s a prime example of how Hi-Fi Rush wields its music, and the most memorable one at that. I swear Hi-Fi Rush could be a premier cartoon series. It’s got best-in-class animation, endearing heroes to cheer for, and villains you love to hate, all wrapped in good-natured humor. But on top of that everlasting charm, it turns a dynamic rock soundtrack into its greatest weapon, putting meticulous detail into syncing the beat to all aspects of the experience. It gives combat a uniquely satisfying momentum that other stylish-action games don’t offer, even when the platforming and targeting system drop a couple notes along the way. Hi-Fi Rush is a memorable journey that marches to the beat of its own drum and without a doubt stands among the action greats. "
SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake ,5,"Whether I’m enjoying my favorite memes or going back to rewatch one of the only cartoons I still legitimately laugh at as an adult, it’s hard to understate SpongeBob SquarePants’ influence on my life. Through it all, the porous goofball I’ve known for years feels like the perfect mascot for an over-the-top, cartoonish platformer. While <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/10/31/spongebob-squarepants-battle-for-bikini-bottom"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">2003’s SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom</a> proved it could be done, we’ve been in dire need of a modern take on that idea starring everyone’s favorite fry cook. And yet, like a collapsing Squidward Souffle, SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake dried up my optimism the more I played: it’s merely a thin, by-the-numbers sequel to the 20-year-old Bikini Bottom rather than the ground-up redesign that absorbs the progress genre heroes like Mario or <a href=""/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-1/46853/review/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-review"">Ratchet and Clank</a> have made in the decades since that we deserve. So although Cosmic Shake does benefit from the quirky SpongeBob characters and their world, as a platformer it’s a terribly bland journey that feels painfully frozen in time even as the fans of the show have continued to age (also painfully). As I’ve come to expect from this delightful sponge, the story begins when he makes a series of extremely ill-advised decisions which cause the very fabric of Bikini Bottom to be torn apart at the seams. Determined to put things right, SpongeBob and a newly transformed balloon version of Patrick begin hopping through portals and fighting samey jelly monsters in search of their friends. What little plot follows is basically just a thinly veiled excuse to revisit memorable SpongeBob episodes, whether you’re running around the prehistoric version of Bikini Bottom or the creepy depths of Rock Bottom, which is a nice trip down memory lane but not exactly an original or memorable SpongeBob tale that can stand on its own.  SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated makes an argument that, if you’re going to remake something beloved, it’s not worth taking any half-measures. Rehydrated’s revisit of the iconic SpongeBob platformer often does just that. Rather than addressing any of the real issues with Battle for Bikini Bottom that could have been tweaked without ruining the spirit of the original, it leaves history intact at the cost of making this a better game – and its problems have only become more noticeable with age and increased competition. There are bright spots that remain fun almost two decades later, and there are pops of ingenuity in its reworking, but it does little to stand alongside the best, or even the pretty good, platformer remakes and remasters we’ve seen this generation. <i> - Jonathon Dornbush, June 22, 2020</i Read the full <a href=""/spongebob-squarepants-the-battle-for-bikini-bottom-rehydrated-pc/37534/review/spongebob-squarepants-battle-for-bikini-bottom-rehydrated-review"">SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated review</a>.  That nostalgic indulgence is helped greatly by the appearance of so many recognizable characters – voiced by their original voice actors – including SpongeBob, Patrick, Pearl, The Flying Dutchman, and Mr. Krabs, most of whom have more than a few amusing lines or gags that they’re a part of. I got a chuckle out of seeing Mr. Krabs as a western bandito or Pearl as a medieval fantasy princess, and the resulting hijinks felt very much like it was straight out of a long-lost episode of the show. Similarly, all the realms you visit along the way are such colorful and vibrantly cartoonish reimaginings of the world of SpongeBob and friends. It’s even got an amazing loading screen where that classic French voice says “one hour later,” and those way-too-detailed closeup images of characters that gross you out, both of which are fantastic nods to the show. That’s what makes it a massive bummer that Cosmic Shake falls so woefully short when it comes to actual gameplay. It’s been almost 20 years since the release of SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom – and just over two since the “Rehydrated” remaster reminded us of how poorly that game’s mechanics have aged – and it’s shocking how little that formula has evolved for this followup. In one of the dullest platformers in recent memory, Cosmic Shake serves up a recipe that’s almost identical to that of its predecessor and had me nodding off as I played. Dreadfully simplistic jumping puzzles and combat against the same handful of enemies who posed absolutely no challenge wore thin quickly. Sure, you can double-jump, ground pound, glide across gaps using a pizza box, attack with your bubble wand, and sometimes activate context-sensitive prompts to do special things like karate kick enemies or swing on a fishing line, but that toolbox is extremely light and never puts you into situations – mandatory or optional – that require a mastery over any of these skills. After the first few hours of its 10-hour campaign, I’d seen just about all the tricks up Cosmic Shake’s sleeves and had to press on through humdrum platforming and combat <i>ad nauseum</i>. Every level has you jump through some metaphorical and literal hoops, broken up by waves of enemies that can easily be swatted away in seconds before going back to platforming. Variety, both in combat and in the “puzzles” that the platforming offers, is a major pain point, and even as you’re traveling through a pirate-themed realm or a Hollywood movie set, you’re fighting the same pushover purple enemies or hopping on the same floating rectangles. Even when you do get a special sequence, like a chase scene atop a seahorse or an extremely brief stealth section, it’s either incredibly short-lived or hardly different enough from the rest of the grind to keep things interesting. The only unique moments are at the end of each level when you fight a boss, like an evil Sandy the Squirrel in a Bruce Lee outfit, though even these highlights aren’t breaking any new ground in terms of gameplay – they just feel loads better than the rest of the boring trek. It’s not that the controls or ideas in Cosmic Shake are poorly implemented, but that they haven’t learned a thing from practically any modern-day platformers that are far more interesting. For example, you don’t get any of the highly entertaining gymnastic platforming feats or unique and silly combat options you’d find in Psychonauts 2 – a game that feels like a lot of its bones would have suited a SpongeBob platformer perfectly. Instead, it plays like every forgettable, middling platformer I’ve played in the past 20 years, and that stunning lack of creativity in an underwater world that’s known for its hilarious originality is a throbbing disappointment for the entirety. As a result, playing Cosmic Shake made me feel like I had put on a high-quality foam SpongeBob costume to attend a costume party, but was forced to perform excruciatingly dull chores while wearing it instead of goofing around; it’s amusing only in the charming disguise that accompanies the otherwise tedious experience. I understand that Cosmic Shake was almost certainly designed with children in mind and I’m sure a kid who hasn’t played a lot of better games would enjoy it just fine, but even so, I can’t imagine any of the children I know enjoying this as much as they would <a href=""/super-mario-for-nintendo-switch/5782/review/super-mario-odyssey-review"">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, which does practically everything better. There are just so many great kid-friendly platformers out there already in 2023, and aside from having SpongeBob's face in it, Cosmic Shake gives you no reasons to play this one over the multitude of alternatives. I mean, you can only blissfully swat around the same three types of enemies or double-jump across identical gaps so many times before you’re sick of it, regardless of your age. Aside from getting through the main story, Cosmic Shake does offer some optional collectathons to complete and even some side quests to go on. Most aren’t worth the trouble, like one side quest that has you cook Krabby Patties for hungry fish in a short minigame. That said, there’s plenty of new content hiding in areas that can be revisited once you’ve gained new abilities, some of which hide interesting secrets and areas that can only be accessed later. Usually, though, they just lead to more of the same dull combat and rote platforming you’ll already be bored with. i>Note: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that SpongeBob SquarePants is no longer airing new episodes. It has been corrected.</i> SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake is a simple, unambitious platformer that pales in comparison to its peers in every way besides all the charm and humor it borrows from the iconic show. Whether it’s the incredibly basic jumping and swinging that becomes irksomely repetitive within minutes, or the humdrum combat that has you mopping up the same handful of enemies hundreds of times without anything to meaningfully differentiate the first battle from the last, Cosmic Shake badly lacks the imagination and creativity for which the show is known. The original cast’s voice performances and silly gags are certainly a highlight, but if you were hoping for something akin to Super Mario Odyssey in a pineapple under the sea, sadly this falls far short. "
Dead Space ,9,"Never mind the numerous necromorphs, the tortured torsos sprouting out of walls, or the terrifyingly towering space sphincter – the thing I was most scared of going into the Dead Space remake is that it wouldn't live up to my fond memories of the fantastically horrific 2008 original. After just over 12 hours spent stalking through the revitalized USG Ishimura I’m happy to report that of the many things to legitimately fear about this haunted space hulk, that was not one of them. This new Dead Space enhances the original in almost every way, using a Plasma Cutter to drop its ugliest appendages on the cutting room floor while preserving the essence of what made its distinctly dismemberment-heavy shooting so special, and grafting on welcome new character details in order to present its creepy sci-fi horror story in its very best light – and its most intimidating shadows. If you missed it the first time around, Dead Space takes the action-oriented brand of survival horror established by <a href=""/resident-evil-4-2005"">Resident Evil 4</a>, evolves the combat with a combination of gunplay and the ability to throw objects with Kinesis and temporarily slow enemies down with a Stasis power, and forces you to unlearn everything you know about killing zombies – its hordes of agitated mutants must be blasted limb from limb as opposed to being instantly dropped with a headshot. It sets its strategic brand of slaughter onboard a doomed spaceship that seems straight out of <a href=""/event-horizon"">Event Horizon</a>, and focuses on the determined plight of engineer Isaac Clarke and his increasingly disturbing search for his scientist wife Nicole. Although it spawned sequels, comic books, and even a spiritual successor in the form of 2022’s <a href=""/the-callisto-protocol"">The Callisto Protocol</a>, in my mind nothing has come close to exceeding Isaac’s first heavy footsteps onto the deck of the Ishimura – at least until now.  Developer Motive Studio has made some major renovations to Dead Space’s house of horrors, and boy do I love what they've done with the place. For one, it looks amazing: the supreme level of detail on Isaac’s instantly recognizable engineering suit alone makes that of the original look like a cheap fabric onesie picked up from the bottom shelf in a costume shop. Our ominous spaceship surroundings are made to feel substantially more spine-chilling thanks to realistically weathered steel surfaces and walls overrun with putridly pubescent levels of pus-filled pimples, and impressively moody lighting highlights the enhanced environmental detail while keeping plenty of corners cloaked in shadow – and us in the dark in terms of what might be lurking in them. Not only does the Ishimura look more striking than ever before, it’s also been restructured to encourage more exploration. Although Isaac’s initial arrival in the hangar and flight deck very closely mirrors the layout of the original, it’s not long until you start to notice some substantial differences. For starters, you can now shuttle freely back and forth between the tram stations connecting all the different sections of the Ishimura (once you’ve unlocked them), and you can also travel between certain areas on foot via new corridors like those that connect the flight deck to the medical deck, or indeed off your feet in other sections. A spectacular new zero-gravity detour that takes you from the hangar bay to engineering is just one area that takes advantage of far more liberating flight controls that allow you to manually steer Isaac through space, as opposed to beaming him in rigid straight lines from surface to surface. The benefit of this more interconnected Ishimura is twofold, since not only does it engender a far greater sense of place than the more compartmentalised original, but it also allows for backtracking to access previously locked doors as Isaac’s security level increases over the course of the journey, giving you the opportunity to discover weapon upgrade schematics and various other treasures and making progression feel a bit like a more murder-heavy Metroid. Additionally, the storage rooms in the original game that could only be accessed by spending a precious power node are thankfully no more; instead, gaining access to them requires a bit of enjoyable environmental puzzle solving, like finding the right angle through a shattered window in order to disable a door’s locking mechanism with a pinpoint shot. An equal level of accuracy is demanded by Dead Space’s combat, too, which remains focussed on literally disarming (and/or dislegging) each snarling flesh golem rather than wasting ammo on their vestigial, brainless heads or spongey torsos. Enemy types resemble the same gaggle of ghouls that seem to have been plucked right off John Carpenter’s Pinterest board, but there have been a few welcome tweaks made to the variety of threats you have to encounter. The acid-vomiting variations of the basic spike-handed Slasher seem to be far more common than they were in the original, and they kept me on my toes even after I’d sheared off their legs from a seemingly safe distance – thankfully Isaac is considerably more nimble than he used to be. Meanwhile the hyper-mobile Twitcher types seem far more frenetic than before, and really put my aiming ability and Stasis reserves to the test. Beyond that, enemies are literally dripping with detailed slime and entrails, but that isn’t just disgusting eye candy. Each necromorph now has several layers of flesh and bone to blast away, not only ratcheting up the gore but also giving you a clear visual indication of how close you are to lopping off a limb, which is extremely handy when you’re trying to prioritise a roomful of twisted targets. Dead Space also finds creative new ways to keep tension levels high, often via the cunning use of the new circuit breakers that force you to divert power between certain interactive elements of the environment, like elevators and gravity control systems, in order to complete a mission objective. At one junction box early on I opted to channel power to a maintenance storage room door… But in doing so I had to sacrifice the lighting system, meaning my journey back out of the area was illuminated solely by the narrow beam of torchlight on Isaac’s Plasma Cutter, making for a considerably more panic-inducing trip as each necromorph flashed into my restricted field of view. Conversely, we’re given a few more objects in our surroundings in order to even the often overwhelming odds, and in addition to explosive canisters and spikes to hurl with extremely satisfying kinesis powers, there are also Stasis canisters that can detonate with wide areas of effect – plunging a group of enemies into temporary slow-motion and giving you a precious moment to decide whether to stay and shoot their legs off or use your own legs to bolt for the nearest exit. (These canisters were previously introduced in Dead Space 2.) Call it science fiction survival horror, but Dead Space does the genre proud with an engaging story; action that's tense, fast-paced and extremely violent; as well as atmospheric qualities that will get under your skin and make you jump. It may be a newcomer, but the seeds of an incredible franchise have been sown, and EA's in a great position to reap a phenomenal franchise full of scares. If you like survival horror, action or sci-fi, Dead Space needs to be on your radar. <i>– Jeff Haynes, October 28, 2008</i a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/10/23/dead-space-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Read the full Dead Space (2008) review</a> Throughout the tension-filled adventure, Motive Studio has kept Dead Space’s best moments largely intact while dramatically overhauling and paring back its weaker scenes. The first fight against a regenerating hunter that takes place in a cryogenic chamber plays out in the same intense, close-quarters style as it did previously, because that brilliantly pulse-raising encounter is just as effective now as it was 15 years ago. By contrast, the much-maligned asteroid-blasting sequence in the story’s first half has been completely discarded and dramatically redone: instead of being stuck in a gunner’s seat struggling to fend off an asteroid shower with a pair of rapidly overheating cannons, we must now head out into space and calibrate the Ishimura’s defense system by boosting between each cannon and manually calling each strike while hulking chunks of space rock spin past our noses towards the ship’s hull. It takes a sequence that was previously an aggravating chore and transforms it into an utterly exhilarating challenge, and it’s just one of a number of examples that greatly refine some of the original game’s rougher edges. There are countless other comparatively minor but equally as welcome upgrades, too – like the way triggering an objective marker actually angles the camera towards a waypoint rather than unhelpfully towards your feet, or how you can buy multiples of any given item in the store at once instead of being forced into a series of individual transactions, or how you can now manipulate doors and control panels while holding up an object with kinesis – the latter of which gave me the option of carrying an explosive canister between rooms in anticipation of an ambush. I particularly like the way that weapons are now found in the world – typically during a story event – rather than simply being bought from the store for large sums of credits. It’s smart to introduce a ‘no money down’ test drive of Dead Space’s seven weapon types particularly for newcomers to the series, even though I admittedly settled on the same powered-up Plasma Cutter, Line Gun, and Force Gun combo that I employed in my multiple playthroughs of the original game. Upgrading those weapons this time around offers far more regular rewards. While the layout for each weapon upgrade tree remains similar in terms of interface, all of the pointless empty slots have been removed, meaning there’s a tangible benefit for each and every power node you choose to invest, whether it’s a boost to clip capacity, reload speed, rate of fire, or damage. Additionally, there are special functions to unlock as you reach the ends of each upgrade path, such as incendiary rounds for the plasma cutter or an increase to the size of the Force Gun’s gravity-swirling alternate-fire mode, which bring much-needed buffs to your combat capabilities against the relentless necromorph waves in Dead Space’s dying hours. By the time I’d reached the formidable final boss I’d augmented my favourite suite of repurposed mining tools with enough extra power to bring a tear to the eye of Tim ‘The Toolman’ Taylor. The monsters in Dead Space aren’t the only things with more meat on their bones, and indeed Isaac’s story has been fleshed out with satisfying new helpings of extra detail. There’s an entirely new multi-part side mission devoted to following a breadcrumb trail of holographic logs that reveal Nicole’s most recent movements before the necromorph outbreak, along with other audio and text files that better explain the strained status of the couple’s relationship and the role that the mysterious church of Unitology played in Isaac’s upbringing. As a result, I found that I was able to achieve a far deeper understanding of Isaac’s wavering mental and emotional state this time around, and although the overall story arc is broadly the same as the original, this added context (along with some clever character tweaks) meant that its shocking final twist felt considerably more plausible. Dead Space’s main man is humanised even further in the remake by his ability to talk, rather than merely accept his crewmates’ orders without so much as a silent nod of acknowledgement like he did in the original. Actor Gunner Wright, who voiced Isaac in the Dead Space sequels, delivers a suitably stoic performance, and it makes Isaac feel like a far more influential figure when he’s actively debating plans of attack with chief security officer Hammond, as opposed to just tackling each task like a deep space dogsbody. Thankfully, this is done sparingly: Isaac only speaks when spoken to, and doesn’t deliver Nathan Drake-style quips while he’s pruning limbs off space zombies like they’re the bloodiest kind of Bonsai tree. Instead, his moment-to-moment status is indicated by his heavy breathing and his hurried heartbeat heard in moments of eerie silence, exactly as it should be. With its stunningly redesigned spaceship, smartly and subtly enhanced story, and spectacularly reimagined action scenes, Motive Studio has managed to successfully breathe new life into the seminal sci-fi horror universe of Dead Space. Despite the fact I’ve returned to the 2008 original several times over the years and found it to hold up fairly well, my latest journey through the darkened hallways of the USG Ishimura still managed to consistently surprise me and pull me into Isaac’s plight far more than ever before, while still satisfying my desire to butcher undead astronauts with an enjoyable arsenal of wildly unsafe mining tools. It’s clear that this superb Dead Space remake has been a labour of love for the team at Motive Studios, who’ve very carefully balanced innovation and renovation with preservation, and to their credit the end result is undoubtedly the definitive way to experience – or re-experience – one of the best survival horror shooters that Capcom never made.

Forspoken ,6,"Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: a down-on-their-luck orphan has their life turned upside-down when they get whisked away to a fantastical new world where they suddenly have magical powers, reluctantly rising to become the hero its people need to stop an evil threat. If that sounds like every fantasy book you’ve ever forgotten you read, it’s probably because Forspoken is a remarkably generic RPG – from its bland story to its lifeless open world. Thankfully its energetic combat and flashy parkour movement system do keep the relatively slim campaign decently entertaining throughout, but running through its boilerplate checklist of repetitive side tasks doesn’t hold much appeal beyond mindless trophy hunting after that. The newest action-RPG from Square Enix puts you in the brooding shoes of Frey Holland, a well-acted but largely unlikable New Yorker who gets pulled through a portal to the fantasy realm of Athia after accidentally becoming bonded to an equally unlikable talking armband she calls Cuff. The four realms of Athia have been afflicted with a corruption that has forced its populace into the last remaining city of Cipal, and it falls on Frey and her newly imbued powers to help its citizens and face four powerful rulers called Tantas – not that she’s very interested in doing so.   Forspoken’s world and story are about as bland as they come, equal parts predictable and forgettable. That’s not so offensive on its own, but the real crime is how poorly the writing establishes any of its characters and the relationships between them – it’s like it constantly assumed I must already be invested in these people in a way it never actually made me. The most egregious example of this is the chemistry between Frey and Cuff, which frames most of the campaign as a sort of buddy cop movie but spends almost no time showing these two unlikely partners grow closer after their introduction. Actual bonding apparently happens off-screen, and this story – which is mostly told through exposition dumps between large stretches of open-world exploration – felt fairly rushed across the 15 hours it took me to beat the campaign as a result. That means the snippy banter between Cuff and Frey come off as obnoxious rather than endearing. Frey is surprisingly vocal about her disdain for most of the tasks Forspoken asks you to complete, and Cuff constantly belittles her for no good reason in a manner that I <i>think </i>is supposed to come off as friendly ribbing but instead feels like awkwardly watching a couple argue at a dinner party. This dynamic never really changes, even as Frey slowly goes through the motions of her predictable hero’s journey, and it is always exhausting. Forspoken is essentially split into two parts: talking to townsfolk and doing mundane side quests like feeding sheep or chasing cats in Cipal, and making your way to some specific point of interest on its absurdly large map to further the story. I don’t think the Cipal sections would have bothered me if conversations and cutscenes didn’t have such a stilted, strangely low-budget feel to them. The performances throughout can actually be quite good, even when the writing leans heavily into telling rather than showing – but none of it is ever very fun to listen to thanks to long, awkward pauses between lines and occasional crowd noise or background music that’s so loud it drowns out everything being said. Between visits to Cipal, you’re generally given a target on your map and free rein to get as distracted as you’d like along the way. That involves sprinting across Athia’s rocky terrain using Frey’s magic parkour skills, flipping over obstacles and eventually using a grappling whip to swing long distances, and then beating the snot out of enemies at various points of interest for new equipment and other rewards. This is what you’ll be doing for the vast majority of your time with Forspoken, and it can be a lot of fun even if those systems never get too deep. Frey gains four styles of elemental magic over the course of the campaign, each essentially a different weapon you can quickly swap between with its own set of alternate fire modes and unlockable support skills – all of which can then be modestly upgraded as you play. Her starting magic is basically an earth-based gun that can be fired rapidly or charged for an area-of-effect burst, with skills that root enemies to the ground, up your defense temporarily, and more. You don’t even have a melee attack until you unlock the fire-based sword option about a third of the way through the campaign, which was a little annoyingly restrictive at first. But once you do open up more of Frey’s capabilities, Forspoken’s particle effect-filled combat becomes quite amusing. Enemy variety isn’t exactly impressive (special larger baddies in particular can be really cool the first time you fight them, but less so by the third), but elemental resistances and unique quirks pushed me to swap weapons and strategies frequently mid-fight in a way I really enjoyed. For example, I loved that shielded enemies could be dealt with either by getting behind them or by charging an AOE shot and then firing it at the ground nearby to knock them off their guard. One-on-one fights can devolve into locking onto your target and holding down the trigger while you strafe out of harm’s way with Forspoken’s <i>extremely</i> generous dodge system, but the group encounters often did a good job of keeping me on my toes. Similarly, the parkour system is a mix of straightforward and flashy, sending you nimbly soaring across the environment by simply holding down the Circle button and pointing yourself in a given direction. Just like your attacks, this becomes a lot more fun once you unlock some cooler skills, like options that boost your speed with well-timed button presses. That said, it is also far more mindless than combat, requiring very little nuance even as additional techniques become available to you and rarely ever testing your mastery of those moves with difficult platforming challenges. Even still, it can be quite a satisfying way to fancifully flow from task to task without much thought. That’s a good thing, too, because there is a <i>considerable</i> amount of ground to cover in Athia, and very little of it is worth stopping to admire. This world is huge, and the campaign doesn’t even send you near half of it. The map is littered with optional side objective markers, but there isn’t much reason to go too far off the beaten path to complete them when the same small handful of tasks are repeated <i>ad nauseam </i>no matter where they are placed. They almost all boil down to either fighting some random dudes to earn a reward or just being handed one outright, and the payoffs don’t feel particularly necessary unless you decide to up the difficulty to Hard. Plenty of open-world games follow a similar structure, but Forspoken does it with such a barebones transparency that Athia comes off less like a world for you to explore and more like a repetitive checklist asking to be crossed off. It doesn’t help that Athia lacks much in the way of interesting visual landmarks, with different areas gated off by blatantly artificial mountain ranges and filled with piles of samey rocks and ruins to hop over. Each of the four regions offer a little twist to their layout, be that wide open fields or extra hills, but they’d still all blend together if it weren’t for the distinct color filter slapped onto each one. After the credits rolled I ran around this map for another dozen or so hours, hoping to find some exciting secrets in the hard-to-reach corners I hadn’t visited – but with the exception of an isolated trader selling a few neat items (literally the only NPC I met outside of Cipal), all I saw was the same side tasks on the same bland landscapes, over and over and over again. I’m sure there will be diehard completionists out there excited for a chance to put on a podcast and spend dozens of hours clearing every single map marker and opening every single chest (the kind of game <a href=""/rage-2/25383/feature/lengthy-okay-games-have-value-too""><u>I actually wrote about back in 2019</u></a>), but I was given very little motivation to do so here. The upside of that lack of urgency is that Forspoken’s progression systems mercifully don’t devolve into a grind on its Normal difficulty either, never forcing you to do anything you don’t want to. There are only three types of equipable items: cloaks, necklaces, and the charmingly creative nail polish designs. The first two are basically identical, increasing your health, defense, and magic while also offering special perks like increasing critical hit chance, while nails provide more unique boons like upping a specific type of magic. A light crafting system lets you upgrade your cloaks and necklaces by using resources you collect out in the field, increasing their stats and letting you swap in the perks of any gear you’ve found so far. That lends a lot of welcome flexibility to how you choose to play (and your fashion choices), but it’s also not the most exciting system since the majority of improvements are simple numerical boosts that are hard to see the effect of in the heat of battle.  While I encountered little to no notable bugs or technical issues while playing Forspoken on PlayStation 5 in Performance Mode, it is worth noting that we have not had a chance to try the PC version before the publication of this review. That doesn't necesarilly mean something is wrong with it (code can be sent out late for a variety of reasons), but that delay combined with the <a href=""https://in.ign.com/forspoken/178386/news/forspoken-developers-reveal-slightly-over-the-top-pc-requirements-along-with-details-about-performan"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">hefty system requirements</a> that were revealed last week do give me a little bit of pause. We won't know for sure how it performs on PC until we've had a chance to try it ourselves, and we will post a full performance review once we do, but it's at least worth a word of caution until then.  Forspoken is the sort of game you’ve probably seen before – from its stereotypical fish-out-of-water fantasy story to its giant open-world map full of repetitive optional tasks. Its combat is flashy and fun enough to entertain across its comparatively short RPG campaign, with fights that do a good job of pushing you to shake up your use of elemental powers even when the overall variety of enemies isn’t particularly impressive. Its parkour system is also satisfying enough, despite the scenery you are running through being about as picturesque as a bowl of rocks with an Instagram filter slapped on. There’s a kind of person that might be enough for, happy to spend hours and hours uncovering every inch of Forspoken’s needlessly large map after the main story, but that doesn’t mean I was able to find much reason to do so once the credits had rolled. "
That '90s Show: Season 1 ,7,"i>That '90s Show is now streaming on Netflix.</i In the age of reboots, revivals, and sequels of beloved classic shows, That ‘70s Show – which aired from 1998 to 2006 – has been given another revival and, unlike the failed attempt with That ‘80s Show, That ‘90s Show succeeds by continuing the story of the Foreman family in Point Place, Wisconsin, even if it does rely a little too heavily on its predecessor at times.  Set 15 years after the end of That ‘70s Show, That ‘90s Show finds Eric Foreman (Topher Grace) and Donna Pinciotti (Laura Prepon) living happily married in Chicago and parents to a young, awkward teenager named Leia (Callie Haverda). They visit Eric's parents – Kitty (Debra Jo Rupp) and Red (Kurtwood Smith) – in Point Place, Wisconsin for the Fourth of July before Eric and Leia go on their father-daughter space camp retreat. But after she bonds with the “riot grrrl”-next-door Gwen (Ashley Aufderheide) and her friends, Leia requests to spend the rest of the summer with her grandparents. Her new basement friends consist of grunge music lover Gwen; Gwen’s himbo half-brother Nate (Maxwell Acee Donovan); his controlling, witty girlfriend Nikki (Sam Morelos); the sarcastic realist Ozzie (Reyn Doi); and the attractive goofball Jay Kelso (Mace Coronel) – yes, the son of Michael (Ashton Kutcher) and Jackie Kelso (Mila Kunis). That ‘90s Show sticks to the same format and mood as the original series. The kids spend their summer doing random hijinks, from attending a rave to picking up free stuff from the Pennysaver to their hilarious, deep discussions while high. Leia is endearing as the wallflower – basically the girl version of her father as a teen. Nate and Nikki, like Michael Kelso and Jackie, are the shallow, incompatible couple. Ozzie is the queer Asian kid living in Wisconsin who is comparable to Fez (Wilmer Valderrama), who was also seen as an outsider. Gwen is very much the rebel like Eric’s best friend Steven Hyde (Danny Masterson). And Jay is a dopey version of Donna, the love interest. If the formula worked before, it should work again, right? To some extent, sure. The characters individually are comical – especially Ozzie, whose sardonic one-liners were amusing – but as a group, they lack the chemistry to believe in their relationship drama. Even the season finale, which ended on an emotional cliffhanger, felt flat and unearned. The show plays into the ‘90s well with its music and the subtle call outs to Glamour Shots, snap bands, Blockbuster, and even the movie Clerks – leading to a hilarious moment when Leia, who had never seen Clerks, makes up that it’s her favorite movie and that Kevin Smith “was so sexy in that.” It’s also fun to see Red and Kitty adapt to the ever-changing society by being introduced to the internet. Kitty, at one point, believes that the government can hear everything through the computer. She whispers to it, “I loved you on Arsenio, Bill” – referencing the president of that time, Bill Clinton, on the ‘90s talk show The Arsenio Hall Show. The series truly works because of its connective tissue to the original with Kitty, Red, Fez, and the many cameos that show up. Fans of That ‘70s Show can expect many inside gags and Easter eggs, with the pilot episode especially completely stuffed with references. It’ll definitely be a treat for those wondering what happened to the beloved characters minus Hyde (due to Masterson’s legal troubles). Rupp, Smith, and Valderrama fall back into their roles as if no time had passed, with Valderrama stealing every scene he’s in. Though it is delightful seeing familiar and some unexpected returning characters in the series, newcomers may not understand the inside jokes or the comedy. For example, the many cameos from Leo (‘70s icon Tommy Chong) made sense in That ‘70s Show, but some viewers today won’t understand his role in this series as being anything other than a stoned hippie. That ‘90s Show is at its best when the gags relate to the original series, especially with the high circle and dealing with Red and Kitty. But that is putting too much weight on the older cast members when the show should focus on the kids of the present day – or in this case, the kids of the ‘90s. That is not to say that, if given a second season, they can’t improve on that aspect. The teen characters have the potential to be even better than their predecessors, but nepotism can only get you so far. Netflix’s That ‘90s Show is a blast from the past of the ‘90s and of memories from That ‘70s Show. With funny moments filled with nostalgia, That ‘90s Show is charming and has a lot of potential. The series follows the same format as the original, which works for the characters and their storylines, but relies too heavily on the original cast – leaving little room for the new wave of talented teens to fully develop their relationships with each other.

High on Life ,8,"They say that tragedy + time = comedy, but in gaming the real tragedy is the amount of time we have to wait between quality comedy games. Thankfully, in the opening moments of High on Life, as my talking gun belittlingly whispered to me that I was doing a great job as I shot dancing aliens in the face, I got the feeling I’d struck gold. While it has bugs and performance hitches and occasionally frolics in unimpressive toilet humor, it largely succeeds at being the type of absurd space satire I’ve always wanted. Whether I was chatting with my shotgun about the merits of science and formulas, covering myself in alien poop to sneak into a secure facility, or inexplicably watching a full live-action movie from the ‘90s on nearby television, High on Life is a game that just knows how to have a good time, and there really aren’t enough of those. This delightfully inappropriate first-person shooter puts its comedic premise and characters front and center and absolutely refuses to take itself seriously. After Earth is taken over by disgusting aliens who kidnap humans to be smoked as hallucinogenic drugs, you begin a ridiculous space odyssey to get revenge against the extraterrestrial drug cartel responsible. All the while, you’re accompanied by the stars of the show: the extremely rude weapons themselves, who serve not only as your tools of destruction, but as the story’s most important characters. These animate weapons (called Gatlians) are easily the best part of the adventure, and include Kenny, the easily flustered pistol that’s basically Justin Roiland doing his usual <a href=""/rick-morty"">Rick &amp; Morty</a> thing, Sweezy, the foul-mouthed sniper rifle that seems to be a reference to Halo’s Needler, Creature, who shoots uses his rapidly gestating children as ammo, and my personal favorite: Gus, the surprisingly wholesome shotgun voiced by <a href=""/curb-your-enthusiasm"">Curb Your Enthusiasm’s</a> JB Smoove. While some took a while to earn my love, spending an entire 16-hour journey with these guys held up right to my face ended up being a fantastic excuse for lots of amusing dialogue and character development. By the time the credits rolled, I really didn’t want to have to put my new best friends back in their holsters.  That’s due in large part to High on Life’s mostly solid writing, which piles on dumb gags, curse-laden rants, and lots of TV screens airing idiotic shows that look like they could have been pulled straight from one of Rick &amp; Morty’s Interdimensional Cable episodes. One level features an intentionally irritating alien who follows you around and rambles on, seemingly without end, until you finally unlock the ability to murder him dead. Another makes you go to Space Applebee’s and have a full meal for no apparent reason. You can also find a movie theater playing the real-world movie from 1990, Demon Wind, complete with <a href=""/mystery-science-theater-3000"">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a>-like commentary via some nearby aliens, which you’d better believe I watched in its entirety. The campaign is only about eight hours long if you have the willpower and focus to ignore all of these delightful distractions and power through, so naturally my first playthrough took me over 16 hours, specifically because I was goofing off for so much of it. The entire thing is just packed with so much silliness and it’s always exciting to spend time planet-hopping through it; I never knew when I might run into something insane, like when I teleported a stretch of freeway onto a jungle planet and watched the occupants of the cars who’d been taken with it slowly devolve from a group of aliens with road rage into an insane cult that sacrificed their own to appease the asphalt gods. A lot of the jokes in High on Life are either lowbrow or sophomoric, or pearl-clutchingly irreverent, and like pretty much all comedy it won’t work for everyone. But as a fan of classic comedy games like <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/14/borderlands-2-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Borderlands 2</a> and <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/04/south-park-the-stick-of-truth-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">South Park: The Stick of Truth</a>, it definitely worked for me. There were moments where all the cursing and shock humor felt lazy or a bit much – and that’s coming from someone with an extremely high tolerance for it – but more often than not the silly bits and crass dialogue land. It’s just hard not to chuckle when the grunt enemies stop in the middle of combat to disrespectfully twerk in your direction, y’know? It’s impressive, though, that in a shooter so ridiculous and purposefully flippant with its setting, High on Life’s story ends up having a lot of heart. I genuinely enjoyed bonding with the washed-up bounty hunter turned mooch couch-crasher, Gene, and I felt real motivation to destroy the alien drug cartel – though mostly to get payback for my Gatlian buddies, not to save the human race. In perfect harmony with High on Life’s completely chaotic vibe, slinging your companion guns in firefights is over-the-top and occasionally a bit messy. Weapons are somewhat inaccurate and enemies flop around the battlefield shooting gloop at you, and in the opening hours I worried there would be little more to combat than using pea shooter Kenny to mop up brainless ants. It doesn’t help that, even on the hardest difficulty, High on Life is almost always incredibly easy to get through – you’re given ample opportunity to restore your health and shield, and incoming bullets are almost always slow enough to be easily avoided. Luckily, once you gain some new tools like the jetpack or other interesting combat options (like Creature’s power to mind-control enemies on the battlefield or Gus’ ability to suck up smaller bad guys right in front of him and then blast them to bits) things get a lot more interesting. There’s still plenty to shake a fist at though, like how weak the enemy variety is, or how hostile aliens occasionally get stuck inside the environment, or the incredibly perplexing decision to make the down button on the d-pad the default button for crouch button  (you can rebind this in the Ease of Access section of your Xbox settings menu). These things certainly don’t make for the smoothest combat experience, and the fun comes from finding creative ways to clear each area of baddies. Like how you can use Kenny’s glob shot ability to toss enemies in the air then juggle them with bullets until they explode, or how you can kill enemies that are behind cover (or stuck in the environment) by using Sweezy’s object-piercing shots. It’s definitely more chaotic and less finely tuned than your ideal shooter, but it’s a pretty good sandbox for pulling off stupid and amusing kills, and that sorta jives well with High on Life’s energy. When your guns aren’t shooting at things, they make trusty allies for getting through each level using their alternate-fire modes – horrifyingly named their “trick hole” – which gives them functionality beyond killing things. Kenny can knock obstacles out of the way with his Glob Shot, Gus can create platforms by shooting his spinning blades into walls, Sweezy can shoot bubbles that slow time in a given area, and more. I was pleasantly surprised at how fun it was to just run around searching for collectibles and hidden loot boxes. In Metroidvania fashion, as you unlock weapons and abilities you’ll gain access to new areas and secrets in locations you’ve already visited, which makes backtracking a worthwhile use of time. Collecting alien Pesos by exploring is fairly rewarding too, as you can use said space currency to buy upgrades for your weapons and bounty hunting suit, which give useful perks like an upgraded version of Gus’ enemy-sucking ability that lets him tear off their armor and give it to you. High on Life also has some crazy and memorable boss fights which serve as loopy crescendos to each level and have you facing down an alien criminal of one persuasion or another. Not only are these fights the only parts where I felt legitimately challenged during combat, but the bosses you fight and the inane things they have you do are almost always fantastic punchlines to whatever that bad guy’s whole deal was. So much so, in fact, that I actually felt kinda sad about having to viciously slaughter them. In one boss fight, the bad guy punished me in a way that made me have to pause for a bit and allow myself to laugh at the meta humor of it – it’s the kind of dastardly attack I could never have seen coming. When you first start it up, High on Life gives you another bit of meta-humor: a disclaimer warning that ""Any glitches or bugs you may encounter are intentional satirical references to other games with glitches and bugs."" That joke didn’t make me laugh as much as I played, because it really is prone to bugs and performance issues that, while rarely bad enough to put a halt to the good times, were a regular irritation. At the time of this writing, a performance patch has been deployed that appears to have fixed the worst of the issues, but in times of extreme stress like a few of the more elaborate boss fights, I am still seeing some minor framerate dips playing on an Xbox Series X. As for the bugs, they’re usually minor annoyances like the time I had a character lock up on me so I couldn’t advance dialogue with him until I reloaded my save, or when a few enemies continued to stand around as intangible beings after I killed them. High on Life is an irreverent, absurd shooter that manages to shine with its outrageous humor, silly setting and story, and some really goofy, foul-mouthed guns that pull the whole thing together for the vast majority of the time. Combat is a bit sloppy, especially during the first act, and the whole sci-fi adventure sometimes has an unpolished feel to it, but once you get some new tools of destruction and movement options, it rises to the occasion. Not all of its jokes find their punchline, but with memorable boss fights, unique alt-fire abilities and exploration, and way more terrible movies to watch than I expected, this wacky journey is definitely worth your time. "
Dragon Quest Treasures ,7,"An adorable Kitty Shield smiles up at me from my latest treasure haul. The local appraiser, unmoved by its cute design, may say it’s not worth much, but that just means I get to proudly hang it on display in my vault instead – it’s not the most valuable piece of my hoard, but I look on it with satisfaction nonetheless. That Kitty Shield is a suitable metaphor for Dragon Quest Treasures as a whole: It’s far from the richest jewel in the Dragon Quest crown, but a laid-back structure, charming world, and endless stream of rewards make it a relaxing RPG still worth admiring. Treasures stars Erik, your thieving companion from <a href=""/dragon-quest-xi/18310/review/dragon-quest-xi-echoes-of-an-elusive-age-review"">Dragon Quest XI</a>, and his sister Mia, but it takes place long before the Luminary stepped into their lives, when both pint-sized pickpockets lived with a crew of Viking marauders. After finding a flying pig and a talking cat (like you do), Erik and Mia fall through a magic portal into another dimension, which conveniently means that nothing they do or see has any bearing on Dragon Quest XI’s established story – but that’s just fine for a game full of constant meta references to the series as a whole anyway.  The portal drops Erik and Mia into Draconia, a world where dragons once turned the hopes and memories of people into treasures and tucked them away for safekeeping, with each one taking the form of items and people from Dragon Quest history. The dragons are long dead, but their various body parts now comprise the half-dozen regions that make up Draconia, though I promise that’s in a cool way rather than a gruesome one. For example, Draconia’s wings are home to windswept moorlands, while frigid mountains and icy caves make up its shoulder, aptly named The Cold Shoulder. Your overall goal here is to build a base for your budding gang of treasure hunters using the money you earn from finding loot, all while helping your cat and pig guides restore good favor with their gods. Hoarding treasure is central to all your efforts, but when you and the part of monsters you’ll assemble to help dig up the sparkly prizes, you’re finding more than just a piece of Dragon Quest nostalgia. You’re restoring something – dreams, connections, and purpose – the people of Draconia (and even your rival treasure hunters) thought was lost forever, albeit indirectly. Meanwhile, the regional train director doesn’t care whether you find armor from <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/02/11/dragon-quest-v-hand-of-the-heavenly-bride-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Dragon Quest V</a> or a statue of <a href=""/dragon-quest-x-the-five-awakening-races-online"">Dragon Quest X’s</a> priestess, but they <i>are</i> thrilled when your efforts lead to their beloved train stations getting back on track, making exploring Draconia easier in the process. This alternate reality setup gives Treasures the freedom to try something different with its story, which it only partially manages to capitalize on. This is more of a Dragon Quest fairy tale than it is a <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/01/27/dragon-warrior-monsters-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Monsters-style</a> spinoff, one of the wholesome, slightly bittersweet variety. Everyone, monster and human alike, is obsessed with finding treasure for no other reason than because it exists – and while that seems like a shallow foundation for any story, the one told here actually tip-toes around some pretty heavy themes. Treasures is a child’s fantasy escape at its heart, a chance for two orphans to leave their abusive home, have fun, and make a life for themselves away from the troubles of growing up and adults unfit to care for them. It feels like Dragon Quest meets J.M. Barrie’s Peter Pan in that sense, which is a surprising but not unwelcome place to draw inspiration. Draconia is the siblings’ Neverland, even down to one of the duo’s primary opponent being a nefarious pirate, albeit of the skeleton variety instead of the hook-handed-old-man kind. Like the Lost Boys of Neverland, time and society forgot the people of Draconia as well, or at least the ones you befriend at the old Trans-Draconic Railway headquarters, where Erik and Mia make their base. It’s heartwarming to watch as you build a surrogate family of misfits and monsters at the railway headquarters, a support group for Erik and Mia and a safe place to return to. For those familiar with Dragon Quest XI’s story, Erik and Mia’s sad, broken future (broken, ironically, by the same obsession with treasure that fuels this adventure) always hangs overhead, adding a tinge of sadness to the otherwise happy setup for dedicated fans. Unfortunately, Treasures never really mines that rich vein of story potential like it could, doing little to build on any of its themes after first presenting them. Erik and Mia have no character development across the roughly 30-hour campaign, and their relationships with most NPCs outside a small handful are limited to interactions that end along with whatever quest they asked you to complete. How much you get out of Treasures’ story and characters depends on how invested you are in the <i>idea </i>of reinvigorating the hearts and minds of this world, since you never witness much of the results of those efforts. It’s hard not to see Treasures as a missed opportunity in that sense, one that with a bit more depth and detail could’ve been something special and more meaningful. In between meeting new people and staring at your treasure hoard, you’ll take Erik or Mia on expeditions to one of Draconia’s islands to see what you can find and convince other monsters to join in the hunt. Once you arrive in these wide open areas, you’re pretty much free to decide what you want to do and when. You could rush to a rival treasure hunter’s base and swipe their hoard, seek out ancient monuments, or persuade a Queen Slime to help restore the Cold Shoulder train station, – or just ignore everything and find more treasure. The main questline is centered on recovering ancient artifacts, but it often takes a backseat to the many extra requests that come your way from friendly monsters and fellow treasure hunters. While it’s easy to get bogged down in the number of objectives – and the horizon does get cluttered with quest markers at times – the benefit of having so many quests is that you’re always accomplishing something, even if those quests are just variations of finding certain resources  A local princess’ emissary could need help finding an ancient monument on the other side of the dragon’s belly. It’s a long trudge to get there, but on the way you can grab some soil to craft more pellet ammo to use in your next battle and pick up a few rare stones to help power the next broken-down train station that needs restoring. Whatever you choose to do, you’re always encouraged to be on the lookout for treasure to help your base grow and unlock new main quests. You have an innate treasure compass that points you in the general direction of rare goods (because of course you do), but it goes haywire when you get too close. That means you have to rely on the treasure vision of your monster companions to track the goods down, with visual clues based on their own line of sight. Slimes only see from ground level, for example, while the vision of a Sham Hatwitch is appropriately obscured by its own hat. It’s a charming, typically Dragon Quest spin on what would otherwise be a repetitive mini-game, and combined with the little ascending jingle that plays when you dig up treasure, it helps keep the routine feeling fun even after dozens of hours. None of the tasks you’re given are ever very complex, but it helps that Treasures and its treasure hunting appeal to the lizard part of my brain that lights up after finding something shiny, solving an easy puzzle, or checking a task off the list. Does it matter if my base’s value increases to substantially, or if I unravel the mysteries of Draconia? No! But I put a cool piece of Dragon Quest history on a plinth back home and made a fictitious, train-loving robot happy once for a few minutes, and that was enough for me. The low-pressure, low-stakes nature of what you’re doing and the constant drip of accomplishment lends Treasures a sense of coziness that makes it easy and enjoyable to pick up, even if you don’t always see world-changing effects from your labors. Treasures passively encourages you to take its quests and treasure hunts in small doses by limiting how much treasure you can carry, which means you have to revisit your base at intervals and take a break from questing. While there’s plenty to do back at headquarters, that intentional speedbump can start to feel a little arbitrarily annoying, like perhaps Square Enix had plans for something bigger that never materialized. You have daily quests similar to what you’d expect from a live-service game, but they play little role in your routine and offer paltry rewards. You can also theoretically build and improve your base, though the improvements extend to just a handful of shops you can only access via the company’s reception desk. Despite drawing inspiration from Dragon Quest Monsters, Treasures is less concerned with you building an unstoppable team of critters and mostly just wants you to explore with them, which is a fitting complement to the emphasis on item gathering. Battles are comparatively simple, too, with the focus firmly on what treasure-finding aptitudes and other skills your companions have. Each monster you take with you has a set of preferred treasures they’re more likely to uncover during expeditions and a species-specific skill called a Forte – abilities such as gliding or sprinting that make travel easier or help you reach difficult places. Each region is fairly simple in structure, with few exciting layouts or well-hidden secrets, and they’re built around using specific abilities to find treasure spots and rare items. Bland as the layouts may seem, the simplicity can be welcome at times as it makes backtracking and avoiding unfriendly monster mobs much more bearable. When you do pick a fight, you play a passive role, helping deal damage with pellets from your slingshot or heal your monster friends. You have no control over their actions and can only issue basic attack and gather commands, but the monster AI is, mercifully, quite adept at figuring out the best way to tackle enemies. Slimes and Drackys work together to set up elemental combos, tankier monsters such as Restless Armor cast their defensive spells at exactly the right moment, and they all actually balance their attack choices to conserve MP. Here, too, there’s the potential for something more involved that makes fuller use of these features – deeper battles with emphasis on building combos and finding the right mix of monsters. And here, too, Treasures prioritizes being light and breezy instead, without much need or reward for giving your team composition that sort of thought and care. There’s actively off-putting about that, especially since these fights are still fun enough as is. It’s just jarring to see what looks like so many discarded plans, and that lack of clear direction is noticeably unusual for a Dragon Quest game. Dragon Quest Treasures is a light, charming take on the classic RPG series. In place of challenging battles and complex campaigns, it offers a cute fairy tale of two orphans finding riches, building a new family, and bringing happiness to a weary land. It’s impossible to ignore the wasted potential for a more nuanced story and more thoughtful combat that could have been, but the relaxed pace and constant stream of rewards still make Treasures a satisfying RPG to plunder your way through. "
Need for Speed Unbound ,7,"No other racing game released this year looks quite like Need for Speed Unbound, and that can be a difficult thing to achieve in such an established genre so steeped in convention. Criterion has gone all-in with wild, animated visual flair that often appears as though it’s been lifted from the pages of a comic book, even as the actual driving and split day/night structure of its races are immediately familiar to those of us who appreciated 2019’s Need for Speed Heat. The result is a uniquely styled racer that regularly looks quite fabulous in motion, though its grating story mode goes over like a banana in the tailpipe and the online mode simply feels stripped down and unfinished. While Heat hardly revolutionised arcade racing, it was a pleasant surprise that put the teetering franchise back on track. For its efforts, developer Ghost Games was… disbanded, and the series drunk dialled its way back into the arms of former flame Criterion Games for Unbound, and it’s received a striking makeover. You can apply artistic embellishments, including smoke and illustrations, to cars like any other visual customisation part. There are a variety of different ones to choose from, although essentially they all seem fairly similar, with the key differences between them mostly limited to the colour of the smoke and the selection of graphics that get thrust from the sides of your car like wings, or flashed above the roof like a tiny, temporary hat. The effects you choose are globally applied to your whole garage, though, and it seems like an oversight that you can’t select bespoke effects for individual cars.  It’s all very stylish in an Into the Spider-Verse, street art kind of way, and I do admire Criterion’s commitment to trialling something that sets Need for Speed apart from its peers. It’s flashy and eye-catching, and it’s very well executed. It doesn’t look like a superficial layer of effects pasted over the surface of the image; it definitely feels baked into the 3D world. Donuts, for instance, look particularly cool as the special animations hold up well even with a very kinetic camera. However, the juxtaposition between Unbound’s cars (which continue to strive towards photorealism) and its cartoon characters and effects <i>is</i> a peculiar one. It isn’t jarring, especially considering that there have been some big improvements with the lighting since Heat and, at its best, Unbound looks like a highly stylised, interactive trailer. But I can’t shake the feeling that it’s a compromise, accidental or otherwise, that Unbound’s vehicles and world haven’t been given the same treatment – like a modern-day Auto Modellista, or 2020’s Inertial Drift. Would that have been controversial? Probably. Divisive? Certainly. But I think it would’ve looked better than this blended solution. Beneath the snazzy effects, Unbound sticks more closely to Heat’s gameplay format than I’d expected. This isn’t exactly a bad thing – Heat was a very welcome course correction after Payback and I enjoyed it. That said, it does make Unbound feel like an evolution of Ghost’s work rather than something Criterion has really put its own stamp on, like it did with its acclaimed 2010 reboot of Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, and its take on Need for Speed: Most Wanted from 2012. Unbound’s new Chicago-inspired Lakeshore map has some nice, grid-like streets and tunnels for its urban racing, but the city itself is actually a bit vanilla compared to Heat’s neon-bathed, Miami-like Palm City. Unbound’s countryside is also quite typical and unmemorable – which, to be fair, was also a criticism of Heat. It’s just freeways, backroads, and trees draped over some hills. There are a couple of nice mountainside segments with multiple switchbacks for drifting, but overall there’s nothing particularly interesting to look at outside the city. In single-player, Unbound’s cops function similarly to Heat, although I think it’s a <i>little </i>easier to slip out their grasp this time around. Unbound seems a lot better at detecting if I’m accelerating into clear space so, unlike Heat, I’m yet to be arbitrarily busted simply because the cops are nearby my otherwise escaping car. This happened quite a lot in Heat, so I’m glad it appears to have been addressed. The strictly arcade-style driving model is also inherited from Heat, which means cars can be tuned for grip, drift, or a balance between the two. I haven’t been able to figure out whether it’s my driving style or my handling slider set-up, but my attempts at grip tuning seem plagued with understeer. The drift handling is more reliable in my experience, and definitely my preference. The ability to choose between a classic brake-to-drift cornering style or an extra pump of the throttle to get sideways remains, too. Continuing to cater to both camps is very smart. Like Heat, racing is divided into day and night events, but Unbound tweaks the formula slightly. While Heat alternates between sanctioned street racing during the day and illegal events during the evening, all of Unbound’s racing is verboten, 24 hours a day. Cop heat accumulated during the day carries over to the night too, so deciding how much police attention you want to take with you into the evening is an interesting juggling act. Higher-paying races require higher initial heat levels, but they also require higher buy-ins – so it’s actually possible to lose money if you perform poorly, especially since Unbound limits restarts. I’m not <i>entirely</i> sold on the gambling angle in general due to some highly questionable manoeuvres by the AI stacking the deck against me, but having more on the line does increase the tension in a mostly satisfying way. To its credit, progression through Unbound isn’t built around winning every single race we come across, which means it can be consistently challenging without entirely stalling our progress. Building up the necessary cash to both craft a competitive car and afford the hefty buy-ins for the high-risk races can become a bit of a grind though, certainly early on. There are three levels of difficulty, and Unbound can be a stiff test at times regardless of your selection. It does cross the line from tough to cheap on occasion, and there were times where an AI racer would blitz ahead so quickly that no amount of perfect driving and boosting could stop them gapping me. Having opponents able to more-or-less speed match you the millisecond you trigger a nitrous boost is not a problem unique to Unbound – it’s a common gripe in a variety of arcade racers – but it is a snag that tends to leave the boost system feeling flaccid and ineffectual. What’s more annoying, however, are the occasions where I’d blast past a crashed opponent only for them to supernaturally respawn well ahead of me on track. It’s extremely frustrating to lose to a racer who clearly cheated to place ahead of you – especially when I’d wagered extra in-game cash on beating them and I’m out of restarts. Even on the tamest setting, Unbound’s AI racers can be unexpectedly competitive at times. I was definitely a little surprised at how ruthless the so-called ‘Relaxed’ setting is watching my kids struggle to keep up; at least, I was whenever I wasn’t too busy wincing at the dialogue. Heat’s script wasn’t exactly in line to win itself an armful of Primetime Emmys, but it <i>was</i> a pleasing pivot away from the pish that was Payback. Unbound feels like a step down from that. The overall story itself is harmless enough, but its trite cocktail of 2020s teenage angst and Tik Tok philosophising definitely pushed me to my tolerance limit. Personally, I suspect Lakeshore’s mayor is just tired of family minivans being speared off the road by 900-horsepower JDM missiles and innocent commuters being hosed off the hard shoulder, so it’s a little hard to empathise with the cast’s constant whining about their personal freedoms being repressed by traffic laws meant to curb wanton vehicular manslaughter. To be fair, I don’t know that there’s an elegant way for a 28-year-old franchise like Need for Speed to truly speak to the full spectrum of its audience at once, but I should warn you that if you’re a veteran player from the mid-’90s I’d hesitate to suggest you’re going to feel very represented in Unbound. Certainly not by any of these young and slim Instagram influencer avatars, whose fashion aesthetic appears to be music festival drug dealer, football match drug dealer, or off-brand Weird Al Yankovic. The mechanical expression enabled by the deep car customisation that previous developer Ghost began reinjecting into the series in its 2015 Need for Speed reboot has universal appeal, and that’s all very much still here in Unbound, but there’s definitely a generational disconnect in terms of the characters and tone. There <i>is</i> a way to engage with Unbound without this story layer, as the cross-play enabled online multiplayer is a separate mode that does away with it and focuses purely on racing and upgrading your ride. Unfortunately, that’s not all it does away with, and online mode is missing quite a few features at launch – the biggest of which is cops. Equally unfortunately: when I say that online and single-player are ‘separate’, I mean entirely separate. Your single-player garage and progression isn’t shared online, so you need to build a new stable of cars. I have to admit that after 30-odd hours of working my way to the top of the story mode, the prospect of starting from scratch online really took the jam out of my donut. When the rubber hits the road it’s evident Need for Speed Unbound hasn’t strayed very far from the fundamentals of 2019’s Heat. This is a little surprising following the series’ shift back to Criterion – a studio that has traditionally had a very distinct style of its own – although it isn’t a bad thing considering Heat was a welcome splash of gas for a franchise that was close to running on fumes. Unbound should, however, turn heads thanks to its bold new animated characters and special effects. Despite the odd juxtaposition between its traditional graphics and the cartoon-inspired flourishes, they are strikingly well done and make for an instantly recognisable instalment of this 28-year-old series. However, while the car customisation tools are as expressive as ever, it does feel unlikely that older players will be able to connect with the single-player mode’s preening cast of entitled chuckleheads, and unfortunately the separate online mode is currently missing core features like cops.

Crisis Core –Final Fantasy 7– Reunion ,8,"Crisis Core –Final Fantasy 7– Reunion is a perfect example of how a game can blur the line between a remaster and a remake, using the skeleton of its already great <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/03/19/crisis-core-final-fantasy-vii-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">2007 PSP original</a> while completely rebuilding the muscle around it. Every change brings it much closer to 2020’s excellent <a href=""/final-fantasy-vii-remake-ps4/35471/review/final-fantasy-7-remake-review"">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>, from its gorgeously updated graphics to its considerably faster combat. However, Crisis Core stops short of the total upheaval FF7R leaned into, and many design choices made with the original PSP game in mind prevent this remaster from being an entirely unblemished reunion. Just as before, Crisis Core is an action-focused prequel that follows Zack Fair, a plucky and likable foil to his far more moody companion, the iconic Cloud Strife. Starting roughly seven years before the events of Final Fantasy 7, Zack hopes to climb the ranks of Shinra Electric Company’s SOLDIER program with dreams of becoming a Soldier 1st Class – the best of the best, just like Sephiroth. Even today it’s still a great story that neatly ties Zack, Cloud, and Sephiroth’s threads together, with real-time combat that melds some quirky systems in interesting ways – like the strange DMW (Digital Mind Wave) slot machine that brings a bit of the Gold Saucer to every fight.  ""Issues aside, Crisis Core is a great PSP game -- no question. It honors Final Fantasy VII's legacy. Even the game's music, while not composed by Nobuo Uematsu, is charming and fits the overall style of the world (though some of Uematsu's pieces do make a return and to absolutely stunning effect). I was sincerely moved by certain portions of the title and I suspect many others will feel the same. I wouldn't dream of spoiling anything for eager players, but I will say that Crisis Core's ending moments are a must see. I'd go so far as to call them brilliant. The power and emotion of the game is heightened by the raw inevitability of Zack's fate, which is fully explored in the original. I really enjoyed my time with this title, despite the gameplay problems, and I think this is yet another fantastic reason to own a PSP. Enjoy it."" - <i>Ryan Clements, March 18, 2008</i Read the full <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/03/19/crisis-core-final-fantasy-vii-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 review</a>. The most immediate and noticeable change to Reunion is its graphical overhaul, using Unreal Engine 4 to get its in-game visuals relatively close to parity with FF7R. Character models look great, environments are highly detailed, and even its menus and UI replicate the remake’s clean look that blends form and function so nicely. Though Crisis Core was already one of the better looking PSP games, these visual improvements make it feel far more modern and surprisingly high-budget for what Square Enix is classifying as a remaster. Reunion could easily be mistaken for a brand-new game in most regards, though there are some remnants of the original holding it back from looking as good as it possibly can. For example, the original CG cutscenes are reused here – they benefit from being presented on bigger and higher definition screens, but they are disappointing when compared to the in-game action. Think of them as being somewhere between the visual quality of Advent Children and the cutscenes from the original PlayStation Final Fantasy games. They’re still fun and well-animated after all these years, but that can’t entirely hide how noticeably they’ve aged. Thankfully, that thick layer of dust is easier to forget about in the heat of battle, especially during its incredible summon sequences, which are the single most visually impressive additions to Reunion. Ifrit’s fiery, lava-filled Hellfire never failed to wow me, nor did Bahamut’s particle effects-heavy Mega Flare. While it’s understandable why Square Enix may not want to completely redo every pre-rendered cutscene, these summons are a tantalizing look at what could have been had they decided to remake all of that footage with modern technology. Animations are greatly improved from the original, but can sometimes feel stiff, particularly when it comes to the way certain in-game scenes are staged. The models themselves look so fresh that it can be jarring when a character unexpectedly moves in a stilted manner, reminding you that, yes, this was originally a PSP game made with the limitations of the time. Still, most dialogue delivery and character movement looks great during in-game cutscenes, and even better in combat. Reunion’s graphical facelift may be what catches your eye initially, but its most substantial improvements are in its gameplay tweaks. Crisis Core was always an action RPG, but the PSP’s single thumbstick and two bumper layout forced Square Enix to get creative with its design, making you shuffle through spells, attacks, items, and more using the left and right bumpers. With a modern controller at your disposal, Zack’s basic attack, dodge, and guard commands are now all mapped to face buttons and triggers, and you can use abilities and cast spells much more quickly by pressing those same buttons while holding L1. If you don’t like how the controls are layed out, you can even remap virtually everything in the pause menu. The DMW system also returns largely unaltered, for better and for worse. Throughout combat, a three-tile slot machine is automatically running in the upper lefthand corner, and when a particular character lines up or certain number combinations are achieved, Zack can get some pretty substantial boosts. Those include temporarily having unlimited MP or getting the ability to execute a powerful Limit Break or Summon. It’s a fun way for combat to feel consistently fresh, but the rate at which these boosts are achieved is incredibly uneven and random, sometimes making a boss a pushover and taking the fun out of figuring out more unique ways to best them. Combat is also faster. A <i>lot</i> faster. Zack can swiftly dodge attacks, roll behind enemies for critical hits, sneak in a few sword slashes, and roll back out of the way to deliver a Firaga blast in a way that makes the original seem downright sluggish. I replayed a bit of it while making my way through Reunion as a refresher, and the difference in pace is simply night and day. Combat still doesn’t feel like it has quite as much depth as the admittedly high bar set by FF7R’s action, and doesn’t benefit from that game’s ability to switch between party members on the fly, but the changes here are still by far the biggest improvement made over the PSP version. Unfortunately, not every aspect of Crisis Core’s gameplay has been updated with the same level of success, and the aging game underneath it all can rear its ugly head again outside of combat. There are some relatively open areas Zack can run around across Midgar and Gaia, but several interior and exterior corridors are often strung together with (thankfully brief) loading screens. And while the 10 story chapters are mostly compelling and typically last about an hour each, Crisis Core’s mission system still offers additional, bite-sized quests originally designed to be played on the go. Most of them aren’t very substantial and almost all boil down to running through the same small number of hallways, randomly encountering enemies, and collecting items from a few chests. Playing these can greatly extend the runtime of the campaign, but I only felt compelled to do a handful of them – some to get additional accessory slots, some for high-powered Materia, and some to see cute story beats from a young, spunky Yuffie. The original game’s fantastic Materia Fusion system returns for Reunion, and lets you combine generally weaker magic, command, special, and support Materia to create stronger and more interesting results. Using the Materia Fusion system, I was able to create the powerful Quake spell relatively early on, and while it allowed me to obliterate large groups of weak enemies almost instantaneously, I still felt like I had earned that strength thanks to some smart fusing. Reunion is also stuffed with simple, distracting minigames that return throughout the story. These distractions almost unfailingly annoyed me until I could get back to the far stronger fights, with activities ranging from slashing down missiles midair to collecting items while on a timer. No matter the task, none are much fun. Thankfully, those don’t slow things down enough to ruin the combat around them, which shines from start to finish even through those distractions. Given how heavily FF7R played with the expectations of fans, I was curious to see if Square Enix was going to adjust Crisis Core’s storyline at all to account for some of the more surprising changes that had occurred, particularly in regards to Zack. However, the main story is identical to what was told in the original game. (Maybe there’s still some sort of unlockable cutscene hiding behind side missions, but I haven’t found it yet if so.) A big change doesn’t exactly feel necessary, either – just like the original Final Fantasy 7’s plot feeds into the changes that occur in Remake, so too does Crisis Core’s, and its story still feels like the most integral entry in the Compilation of Final Fantasy 7 outside of the first game. The events that transpire in Crisis Core add intriguing depth to Cloud, the Turks, and many other characters from Square’s beloved classic and its remake – Sephiroth, in particular, becomes much more humanized during its runtime. It’s easy to play the original Final Fantasy 7 and not really know a thing about Zack, but his story is so pivotal to Cloud’s that his presence towers over it in surprising ways even without much screen time, and his arc in Crisis Core is still as emotional as it was 15 years ago. Voices for characters like Zack, Sephiroth, Aerith, and more have also been replaced by their respective voice actors from FF7R, giving a stronger sense of cohesion between Reunion and the as-of-yet unfinished trilogy of Final Fantasy 7 remakes. However, while the overall story of Crisis Core remains compelling and fascinating as a prequel, there <i>are </i>aspects of the tale that veer towards the endearingly nonsensical flavor of storytelling present in some other Square Enix games. These moments don’t derail the story entirely or anything, but awkward jokes, strange obsessions with what it means to be a monster, and sometimes cringe-worthy dialogue do occasionally distract from the otherwise enjoyable story. Crisis Core –Final Fantasy 7– Reunion pushes the definition of a remaster to the edge, completely renovating the 15-year-old PSP game’s graphics, combat, and more. That said, many of the design choices made for the handheld original – like bite-sized side missions and an abundance of loading screens – are left intact, keeping this experience from feeling completely modern. But even with a few aging quirks, Crisis Core remains a fun, compelling, and integral chapter in the ongoing Compilation of Final Fantasy 7, and Reunion is the absolute best way to experience it. "
Dwarf Fortress ,10,"Seven dwarves set out from the Mountainhomes to establish a new colony in world rife with gods, monsters, and ancient legends. Though small, these dwarves are the heroes of our tale: Short, sturdy creatures fond of drink and industry. In their ingenuity they will craft incredible artifacts, face great evils, and establish a citadel to stand the test of ages... or they'll dig a little too close to a volcano and flood the whole thing with lava. Then you'll generate another world, with brand new gods, monsters, and ancient legends, and do it all again. All that and more is par for the course in Dwarf Fortress, perhaps the most cult in the pantheon of cult-classic video games, has been generating stories of triumph and tragedy for nearly 20 years already. Its incredible depth has long been locked behind an accessibility barrier of text-based ASCII graphics, arcane keyboard controls, and an inscrutable maze of fan-created mods and tilesets to make it more approachable. And while that admittedly high wall was already worth climbing over, its premium release on Steam brings new graphics and a slew of quality-of-life improvements that fundamentally enhance this amazing game for the next generation of storytellers.  Even if you never dared these intimidating tunnels yourself, you’ve almost certainly felt Dwarf Fortress’ impact elsewhere. Developer Bay 12 Games effectively founded the genre we now call the Colony Sim with its initial release in 2006, paving the way for games like <a href=""https://www.ign.com/games/rimworld"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">RimWorld</a> while influencing countless others, and it's still a reminder of how this combination of procedural generation and rules-based, reality-driven simulation can create unparalleled stories on the fly. Even today, among its many successors, nothing creates a world and fills it with interesting characters so reliably as Dwarf Fortress, and it is a sublime experience to watch this simulation of a world at work as you play your part in it. Doing so is far easier now. The refreshed graphics use a system of sprites, dynamically assembled, to show the dwarven world in all its glory. There are graphics for hundreds of different animals and animal-men, not to mention for dragons, hydras, unicorns, and the like. Even the special Forgotten Beasts, Titans, and Demons, randomized and unique as they are, have generated appearances to match. Beyond improving on ASCII symbols, the sprites and tiles – both static and dynamic – are a superb example of the pixel artist's craft. This fresh coat of paint is overlaid with a lively new soundscape of nature noises, dwarven work, tavern chatter, and whistling cavern winds that provides an actual sense of place. Atop that is a soundtrack of classical guitar (an homage to the single-track guitar noodling that once accompanied the free version of Dwarf Fortress) that both fits the legacy and includes delights like singing in the actual in-game dwarven language. Perhaps most notably, Dwarf Fortress’ Steam version brings the controls out of the early ‘90s, adding the integrated ability to use the mouse, a fully-fledged graphical interface, and settings menus rather than being forced to directly edit game files if you want to adjust difficulty. The proper mouse support alone is, to me, worth the cost of entry here: You can paint out walls, mining tunnels, and more with ease. More vital for new players, you can click a tile to easily get a tabbed inventory of everyone and everything on it, including quick buttons for basic interactions like forbidding your dwarves to touch it – you know, for when you kill that giant six-eyed cave bird with poisonous blood and your chef immediately tries to get a jump start on tomorrow's dinner. For all that improvement – and it is a shockingly huge and remarkably thorough improvement – Dwarf Fortress is still an unapologetically complex game underneath. Its new tutorials go a long way toward teaching you how to play by setting you up with a world, a relatively safe embark site, and a fortress that can supply its own necessities (e.g. food and booze). Even so, a tutorial still can't teach a tenth of what you’ll likely want to know over the course of your adventure, and those new to this genre will need patience. This is, after all, a game where you have to construct separate workshops to spin plant fiber into thread, then weave thread into cloth, then optionally dye the cloth, before making even a single dwarven sock. It's a game where you'll become an amateur mineralogist – as all good dwarves are – to figure out where in the geological strata to dig for iron, tin, coal, or gold. You'll somehow learn the difference between gabbro and granite. You'll almost certainly read an article describing what a quern is. It sounds like a lot – and it is – but learning real-world information and then being able to immediately employ it in your game is extremely rewarding. One of the biggest conceits in Dwarf Fortress is that you can't directly control your dwarves, outside of actively mobilized military squads. You're a kind of central planner, setting up labor permissions, directing production, and blueprinting their constructions, but how soon any of it happens is up to them. They might be too busy taking a nap, or eating, or listening to the local bard tell a story. And it's delightful that you can't <i>make</i> them do a damn thing, because dwarves each have an entire simulated inner life of their own. They have thoughts, memories, favorite things, personal skills, relationships, and physical traits, all of which you can read about in menus or sometimes see on their sprites. The sheer complexity of the simulation means they’ll occasionally make bizarre decisions because of who they are, and the procedural nature of it all means that those are sometimes hysterical, frustrating, or even poignant. For example, dwarves are infamous for leaving things outside the fortress and then later trying to retrieve them no matter the circumstances. Everyone has their own tales of the time <a href=""https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Urist"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Urist</a> sprinted out into a goblin horde because they forgot their socks in the pasture, or of moments when a horrible beast emerged from the caverns – opposed only by your brave militia – and some hapless child went skipping through the battlefield to go and pick mushrooms in the lower caves. That simulated idiocy can be obnoxious at times, but it can also result in some beautiful stories. I once had two dwarves, a doctor and surgeon, who decided to get married in the middle of an ongoing crisis. As nearby patients cried out in pain amid my hospital room and enemies were at the gates, they had their wedding officiated by their friend, a farmer. Poignant, as though they’d decided that if their lives were threatened they would rather die married than apart. Hilarious, because a patient was still sitting open on the surgical table and everyone involved was spattered with blood as vows were exchanged. i>In 2019, IGN's own </i><a href=""https://www.ign.com/person/JDavisIGN"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><i>Justin Davis</i></a><i> wrote about </i><a href=""/dwarf-fortress/23428/feature/dwarf-fortress-is-the-craziest-game-youve-probably-never-heard-of""><i>the wonders of Dwarf Fortress</i></a><i>, calling it ""easily the deepest - and maybe most harrowing - sim game out there.""

You can flip through the entire thing below and see how this particular world went for him in a pre-Steam version of Dwarf Fortress:
</i Dwarf Fortress is also unapologetic about how much reading is involved, which is reams, as this is a game that generates whole novels worth of tall tales. Basically, none of these stories happen without reading a dwarf's thoughts or observing their relationships in the character menu that pops up when you click on them. The addition of graphics helps, but this is still in many ways a text-based game. You read descriptions of objects, of people, of combat, because Dwarf Fortress focuses all its energy on creating and simulating events that happen, not on rendering them in great detail as they happen. These stories are everywhere in Dwarf Fortress, especially as your fort population climbs into the dozens, and finding them is part of play. Notifications let you know that certain things are happening, but to fully understand them you have to read the event logs, look at the life histories of your dwarves, and spend some time paused just poking around in the day-to-day of your fort. It's deeply rewarding for those who are curious and introspective, or who enjoy roleplaying their fortress inhabitants and figuring out why they do what they do. This is a nerd game par excellence, asking for attention and caring in a vast range of subjects and disciplines, where there is always something new to learn, a challenge to attempt, or an absurd project to try. I don't find all its complexity scary or intimidating; it’s more of a challenge I want to rise to. Building a fort is a sandbox, and you can engage – or not – with many of the systems in Dwarf Fortress to your own heart's desire. I don't like fiddling with windmills and powered pumps, for example, so I rarely use them. The sheer flexibility of the systems in Dwarf Fortress are really only limited by your imagination, your understanding of how they work, and your comprehension of the interface. The procedurally generated worlds pop up remarkably fast, letting you create new ones almost at a whim, each with its own cast of characters, civilizations, artifacts, gods, religions, stories, books, instruments, and more – all with history that stretches back centuries before the “present day” you start in. Not that you need more than one world for hundreds of hours of play, considering they come complete with biomes to build in as diverse as swamps, tundras, grasslands, deserts, badlands, mountains, coastlines, marshes, riversides, and jungles, to name a bare few, and each has good, evil, and savagely primordial variants. As long as you go in knowing that most fortresses end in ruin of one kind or another, you understand that you're here to collaborate with game systems, not fight them. The new controls lend so much power to that style of play; the simple ability to click through the interface makes building workshops and placing furniture a breeze, and letting your dwarves just build them out of whatever material is convenient rather than optimizing exactly what stone is used for a kiln takes some of the busywork out of common tasks. The same goes for above-ground constructions, once a laborious process of scrolling back and forth between the Z-levels of Dwarf Fortress’ 2D top-down map, now made simpler by the convenience of a default view that properly shows what's beneath empty tiles. That's great, because construction is an entire subgame of its own. Placing fortifications and workshops or building guard towers is one end of it, but so is optimizing efficient fortress designs where dwarves travel a minimal distance from their beds to meals and workshops. You can set things up so your fort becomes a hub of crafts and trade, selling carved-stone tchotchkes and baubles to the wider world, or one where dwarf smiths use the secrets of steelmaking to forge an invincible military. You can build a massive statue and light its eyes with magma pulled from the earth's depths, or create a complex system of pumps to irrigate vast caverns for mushroom farming. It's incredibly fun to place sequences of devious traps, like pits that open on a pressure plate, blades that emerge from walls, triggered crossbows, or more elaborate designs: Some of my favorites are entire false entrance ways that open, let in attackers, and then seal before flooding with water or magma. I’ve used minecarts filled with swords that stop abruptly and fling their contents into the enemy at high speed – we call those dwarven shotguns. Or you can opt for the direct approach, where you train a dwarf army and send it off-map to conquer nearby towns or cities, demanding shipments of supplies as tribute. The ultimate fate of all forts is to fall into ruin or be retired when you get bored of its success, and having a fort either get destroyed or simply peter out is part of how you learn the deep systems, gaining ever more knowledge of how to survive dwarven life for next time.  The community's motto has long been that ""Losing is Fun!"", and you'll see players describing doomed ends that range from poisonous monster breath to dwarven civil wars as a potential source of that ""Fun."" You set your own goals – become the new Mountainhome, subjugate your neighbors, or just have the happiest dwarves in the world, among many other possibilities. One of my favorite game challenges to build around comes when you open up the large, subterranean caverns beneath the earth, home to creatures like giant white crocodiles, impish crundles, or pale, blind cave ogres. Opening caves then attracts wandering monster-slaying adventurers who will petition to live in your fort so they can explore the depths, which means you'll probably want to build… a really cool tavern, complete with staff and bards. All adventurers need a tavern, after all. I love to read the combat logs of slayers against monsters. Though the most complex battles in Dwarf Fortress may look like two swarms of blinking sprites smashing into each other on the surface, diving into the details of what's happening both during and after a fight is great. Spears get stuck in bone, limbs are severed, and wounded warriors slip in puddles of their own blood. Desperate fights come down to unarmed struggle, with one side choking the life out of the other. This struggle really means a lot once you get to know the characters in question, by both directing and learning about their lives. Sometimes a good day in Dwarf Fortress is fighting off a dragon attack. Sometimes it's seeing that one of your dwarves likes frogs, and then making some frog statues for their bedroom.  Of course, many of the places where the new version of this vast and beautiful game has flaws are the same as they have been for years. For instance, so much is going on at any given time that performance inevitably suffers as maps grow in size and complexity. The latest version runs smoother than ever, but can slow to a low-FPS crawl when large crowds of characters or creatures show up unexpectedly. Setting high limits and building ever-larger fortresses will inevitably bring what the community calls FPS Death, with forts of more than 200 dwarves becoming unsustainable on any but the beefiest PCs. As always, generating smaller background worlds and picking smaller fortress sites helps – as does stuff like making sure your dwarves throw their dirty socks into a magma-based disposal system to reduce the number of objects that must be tracked in the world. That comes back to the interface, which makes a heroic effort but still struggles to contain the sheer volume of content that Dwarf Fortress contains right off the bat, let alone what it generates during play. Just like its performance, this newest version is leaps and bounds better than its predecessors, but the usability is still limited by your patience with learning where any given piece of information is kept. Dwarves alone have a dozen tabs and subtabs in their information panel, and a single game tile can contain multiple objects to be clicked on and have their descriptions read. That does mean it's much easier to do many things, though. Managing dwarf labors and preferences – like what to do with their trash, what goods to stock at the trade depot, or how many people are on the mining detail – comes down to either a simple checkbox system or categorized lists that have a rudimentary search or sort. But it can still get overwhelmed fast by lots of items, and lacks some basic UI comforts like hotkeys for moving items to the top or bottom of lists. It's not very fun to click a bunch of specific items, all in a row, to trade away. The updated controls are pretty flexible, at least, and let you rebind just about anything. That’s a smart, player-friendly nod to the fact that learning hotkeys and shortcuts will still be important to make any experience playing Dwarf Fortress smooth. For me, learning where every nugget of information is kept and the fastest way to access it is part of the charm. You can't love Dwarf Fortress and also complain that it's too complicated to play – its complexity necessitates its form. In a similar vein, you wouldn’t buy a Porsche or Ferrari and then complain that it requires constant maintenance to reach its potential. Dwarf Fortress is complicated because it is a machine made by two dedicated craftspeople over decades, tuned for precisely one glorious purpose: to generate entire worlds and fill them with endless adventure. If I had to pick one game to play for the rest of my life it would be Dwarf Fortress, because I don’t think I’d ever run out of new and fascinating things to do in the 50 to 60 years the statistics say I have left. Infinitely explorable in its complexity and equally as rewarding in the depth you’ll find there, this is the quintessential world simulation and building management game. Until now its magnificent worlds have been obscured behind inaccessible ASCII art and a difficult interface that only a dedicated few were able to appreciate. But this new Steam version is beefed up with lovely graphics and sound, as well as modern controls and a proper UI, opening the floodgates for a new generation to blissfully drown in its magnificent story engine. What lies within is a genre-defining achievement that – in addition to its place in museums, academic texts, and the hearts of its many devotees – shows how incredible video games can be when a developer has a precise goal and valiantly strives to achieve it, even if the effort takes decades.

Far Cry 6: Lost Between Worlds DLC ,7,"While Far Cry 6’s previous DLCs may have put <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/far-cry-6-pagan-min-control-dlc-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">past</a> <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/far-cry-6-joseph-collapse-dlc-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">villains</a> from the series into the spotlight, the latest expansion returns to familiar territory in a different way: by totally jumping the shark. Dropping you back in the shoes of Dani Rojas, Lost Between Worlds is all about an alien entity called Fai that crash-lands in Yara, creating a multitude of time rifts and portals to alternate dimensions. What ensues is a web of interconnected semi-roguelite levels that you’re free to playthrough in any order you want. It’s a genuinely fun way to bring an end to Dani’s story that I found myself happily plowing through all six hours of in a single day, even if it did essentially feel like a watered down version of the main game. Similar to how <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/21/far-cry-3-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Far Cry 3</a> brought us the neon-dripped <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/04/30/far-cry-3-blood-dragon-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Blood Dragon</a>, <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/far-cry-4-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Far Cry 4</a> gave us a fantastical <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/far-cry-4-valley-of-the-yetis-dlc-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">valley of Yetis</a>, and <a href=""/far-cry-5/12415/review/far-cry-5-review"">Far Cry 5</a> dropped us off on <a href=""/far-cry-5-lost-on-mars-dlc/16986/review/far-cry-5-lost-on-mars-dlc-review"">Mars</a>, Lost Between Worlds isn’t afraid to cap off Far Cry 6 by getting a bit weird. Fai’s arrival scattered five shards into alternate dimensions, and it needs your help to find those shards and reassemble its ship to get off the planet. Thankfully, the mere process of shard collecting should save the world from ending as well – convenient, right? The best way I found to have fun with Lost Between Worlds was to just immediately give into a suspension of disbelief. There is no <i>real </i>explanation for an alien craft crashing onto Yara and the sooner I realized that didn’t matter, the sooner I was having fun blasting away at the DLC’s colorful, crystalline enemies.  Far Cry 6 is some of the most fun I’ve had with this series in nearly a decade. Its cast delivers strong performances across an enjoyable story, even if it’s also a fairly predictable one that doesn’t always land the bigger swings it tries to take. And despite some faltering new inventory mechanics and a handful of bizarre design choices, its creative weaponry means taking down an outpost, ransacking a convoy, or even just taking a ride with a buddy has never felt better. - <i>Jon Ryan, October 6, 2021</i Read the full <a href=""https://me.ign.com/en/far-cry-6/190235/review/far-cry-6-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>Far Cry 6 review</u></a Collecting shards means venturing through portals into destabilized twists on the real world called rifts. Each rift looks like a cool, bizarro-world version of Yara and is essentially a self-contained level with a unique quality that poses a new challenge. For example, one rift suffers from periodic lightning strikes, another features a slowly descending spiral of doom from the clouds, and another is totally pitch black other than the pink glow of the precious shard. While venturing through rifts you can also collect sparkling “Glint” fragments. When you die, you can spend Glint to revive at the start of that rift if you have enough – otherwise death means you’ll have to restart your entire run back at the beginning of the rift web with Fai. That’s a welcome failsafe for anybody not as into a more traditional roguelike formula, but I didn’t actually die very often throughout Lost Between Worlds, and rolled credits with a whopping 1,000 Glint saved up. Once you reach the end of a rift, you must pick between two portals (red or blue, naturally) to advance further. The portals are simply gateways to your choice of two other random rifts, and which ones they lead to stay the same for the whole run. That provides a fun sense of variety to mix things up the first time you go through a new portal, but also means you’ll know where it connects if you have to backtrack through a rift later on. Your map even shows you which portal connects to which rift once it’s unlocked, so you don’t have to guess once you’ve visited each rift at least once. After every shard you collect, Fai grants you a new piece of gear to speed your rift travel along. For example, after you bring back the first shard, she will give you a C4-style bomb that can be used to open up shortcuts on subsequent rift visits. Other gadgets include a grappling hook for scaling walls to skip sections and a key for opening previously locked doors that usually contain loot. This is a great progression structure because it dramatically reduces repetition if you’re not required to play through entire rifts all over again every time you visit.<a href=""https://me.ign.com/en/far-cry-6/190235/review/far-cry-6-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""></a Outside of that handful of permanent gear upgrades, any weapons and gadgets you’ve collected along the way will be lost whenever you collect a shard or die trying. Since there are only a handful of weapons to find, I like this feature because it forces you to adapt to whatever is available rather than picking a favorite gun and never switching. In turn, that helps each rift remain entertaining even when you visit it for a second or third time. Since all of the rifts criss-cross and interconnect in various ways, you don’t even have to visit the same rift more than once or twice if you don’t want to. For example, I absolutely hated the rift that requires you to swim around underwater, making you float from bubble to bubble while trying not to drown. It was plain annoying and tedious, like most water levels. So, I just avoided it on all of my other shard collection journeys. I vastly prefer this style of pre-meditated variety over the procedural generation or random rift selection that Ubisoft could have opted for here, letting me play each scenario in the order I preferred. The other major twist Lost Between Worlds introduces is “chromatic combat.” All of the enemies in this DLC are crystallized humanoid creatures that are either purely blue or purely red – in order to damage one, you must shoot them with their matching color by changing your own bullet color on the fly. (Although, for some odd reason, the default keybinding on PC for switching colors is ‘L’, which was obnoxiously inconvenient until I swapped it to my mouse’s thumb button.) Unfortunately, this color-changing idea doesn’t really add much since enemies seem to always spawn in the same places each time you visit a rift and swapping is as simple as a button press. Other than amplifying the other-worldly visuals on display, it’s mostly pointless. That’s especially true since there are only a handful of actual enemy types between your standard assault rifle users, snipers, melee rushers, and shielded machine gunners. I’d have preferred better encounter design or more creative enemy AI over adding a superfluous color-changing layer to combat.  Lost Between Worlds’ web of interweaving levels may be more restrictive than Far Cry 6’s usual open world, but this wild new structure totally works. What Ubisoft lost in vast level design they made up for with a creative alternate dimension concept that encourages replaying levels, unlocking new paths, and mixing up your approach. There isn’t much to the story this time around and the addition of color-coded enemies doesn’t do much to shake up its otherwise untouched combat, but the interesting premise and engaging gameplay loop at least help this add-on outrank the previous villain-focused DLCs. "
The Callisto Protocol ,7,"A <a href=""/dead-space-4"">proper remake</a> might be rising from the grave next year, but the festering corpse of <a href=""/dead-space-2008"">Dead Space</a> has come lurching back to life early in the form of The Callisto Protocol. This spiritual successor to the sci-fi survival horror series recreates the haunting blood-streaked hallways and space zombie-slaying hallmarks first established on the USG Ishimura back in 2008, and injects the gore with more awe than ever before thanks to some strikingly detailed splashes of blood and guts. Unfortunately, while the mutant dismemberment has never been more vivid, The Callisto Protocol’s shortcomings appear just as clearly. Occasional control annoyances, imbalanced combat, and a general absence of innovation result in a roughly eight-hour massacre that’s gratifyingly gruesome, but never quite as great as the series that inspired it. Catastrophe has struck the Black Iron Prison facility on the moon of Callisto, and the convicts are revolting; not just in the sense that they’ve escaped their cells and are causing a riot, but also because they’ve been infected by a mysterious virus that’s mutated them all into twisted toxic avengers. It’s up to wrongly incarcerated cargo pilot Jacob Lee to get to the root of the resident evil and find a way off the prison planet, undergoing a claustrophobic crawl through an exceptionally well realized facility in ruin and overrun by lunar-based lunatics. What follows is a fairly linear gauntlet run, but thankfully the team at developer Striking Distance Studios has proven itself to be masterful makers of creepy corridors – rarely are any two passages ever the same and each area is given a distinct sense of place, from the maintenance room decorated with dangling corpses that look like prison guard pinatas, to the frosted-over facilities that lie beyond the prison walls.  Josh Duhamel from the <a href=""/transformers-theater"">Transformers</a> movies does a commendable job in the lead role, as does <a href=""/the-boys-26"">The Boys</a>’ Karen Fukuhara as his main ally Dani Nakamura, but the majority of the desperation and discomfort of the pair’s plight is conveyed through the impressive art direction and audio design. With the third-person camera tight on Jacob at all times, you get a clear look at the sweat sheen on his scalp in the humid laundry area, the blood-spatter that soaks his coveralls after each brutal encounter, and the especially icky sewerage that coats his body after he’s forced to wade waist-deep through waste management. Everything is thick and gross in a genuinely palpable way and reinforced by unsettling scrapes and sickening squelches in the darkness around you. And while it’s become a common technique for developers to mask the loading of new areas with the use of narrow gaps in the terrain for players to shimmy through, here they fortify the feeling of dread rather than becoming a drag. As Jacob inched his way through the disgusting pus-boil and tendril-covered caves of Black Iron’s lower levels, his winces on screen mirrored my own looks of unease. The Callisto Protocol's putrid penitentiary had me locked in a state of maximum insecurity. Let’s address the elephant-sized mutant monster in the room, though; The Callisto Protocol is effectively a <a href=""/dead-space-2008"">Dead Space</a> game in everything but name, with Striking Distance Studios even being lead by <a href=""/dead-space-2008"">Dead Space</a> co-creator Glen Schofield. From the neatly minimalistic HUD which grafts Jacob’s health bar into the back of his neck like a phone battery indicator, to the stomping of crates and corpses to uncover precious resources, to the combat system that heavily relies on a battery-powered telekinesis ability that allows you to hurl objects around with a flick of Jacob’s wrist. There’s even evidence of a mysterious religious cult that’s somehow involved in the outbreak, and instructions on how to kill enemies left in blood smeared on the walls. It stops short of introducing Isaac Clarke’s stasis ability, and swaps his collection of weaponised mining implements for a more conventional arsenal of pistols and shotguns, but it otherwise feels very familiar – and as someone who’s played all of the <a href=""/dead-space-2008"">Dead Space</a> games, it made for a campaign that was heavy on startling jump scares but light on any major story or gameplay surprises. The biggest deviation that The Callisto Protocol makes from <a href=""/dead-space-2008"">Dead Space</a>’s terror-fueled template is it’s increased emphasis on melee combat, at least during the opening hours. With weapons and ammunition initially scarce, dispatching each snarling cellmate demands that you lure them into an uncomfortably close proximity, sway out of the way of their clawing attacks, and then counter with a flurry of blows from Jacob’s stun baton. The thumbstick-based dodging and blocking of incoming attacks feels a bit like ducking and weaving in a boxing game – except your opponent is less like Holyfield and more like ‘Holy crap!’ – and it feels satisfyingly weighty to bash their limbs off one by one and bludgeon baton-shaped grooves into their skulls. Even as Jacob’s arsenal grows, melee combat remains a smart way to conserve ammo since each successful combo string you land opens up a brief window to perform a ‘skill shot’, allowing you to automatically lock-on to a weak spot with your firearm and down them in a few shots instead of a full clip. I enjoyed the risk-reward choice involved in getting up close and personal rather than trying to more safely pick enemies off from afar, not least because the already tight-in camera pulls even closer to really highlight the carnage as you administer each infected inmate with a lethal injection of hot lead. Unfortunately that high level of tension isn’t sustained once the GRP is introduced. Powerful enough to lift most enemies into the air, this gravity-defying gauntlet can certainly make for some dynamic combat encounters, particularly in tandem with the various deathtraps and volatile objects that are handily positioned around each area. You might enter a room full of ghouls, lift up one and impale him on a spiked wall, throw another into an exposed grinding mechanism, before finishing off a third by hurling a saw blade through their midsection, all before they’ve realised you were ever there. It can be a lot of fun in a jailbreaking Jedi sort of way and it often produces some gloriously gory results, but it also means that major threats are often too swiftly snuffed out, like you’re Indiana Jones bringing a gun to a swordfight. GRP is an ability that depletes and must either be recharged over time or instantly topped up with batteries should you have one in your inventory, so I couldn’t constantly use it as a crutch, but I certainly felt it gave me the force-flinging upper hand in the bulk of enemy encounters even on the ‘maximum security’ difficulty setting – at times making me wonder if the most dangerous monster lurking in Black Iron was actually me. The overpowered nature of the GRP meant I didn’t really bother investing too much in The Callisto Protocol’s weapon upgrade system. I certainly splurged on basic augmentations like expanded clip sizes and recoil dampening, but never felt the need to scrounge up enough Callisto credits to buy the more exotic enhancements. After all, what use are explosive rounds for the riot gun or the homing bullets for the assault rifle, when the ability to throw the ever-present explosive canisters or pick an enemy up and drop them over a ledge is the only alternate fire mode I ever really required? Similarly, stealth sequences fail to induce much in the way of stress. Midway through Jacob’s great escape The Callisto Protocol introduces a deadly blind variant of the infected that are reminiscent of the clickers from <a href=""/the-last-of-us"">The Last of Us</a>. However, although they’re purported to possess an elevated sense of hearing, I found it surprisingly easy to violently shiv them to death right under the nose of other enemies who seemingly wouldn’t bat an eyelid – assuming they have eyes – despite the loud death squeals of their freshly dispatched friends. A far more serious threat are the towering terminator-style security droids that can only be destroyed with a pinpoint headshot – mess it up and you’ll likely be swiftly minced by their high-powered canons – but strangely these genuinely formidable foes are introduced early on and then rarely encountered again. That’s not to say there isn’t a healthy variety of enemy types to tackle in The Callisto Protocol. Although they embody a fairly customary set of survival horror archetypes – standard zombie-types, suicide bombers that rush you, spider-like creatures that scramble on all fours up walls and along ceilings – they all look wonderfully repulsive, and even better when you’re making space jam out of their space guts. Before too long a regenerative ability is introduced that enables basic enemy grunts to transform into more resilient brutes if you wound them without finishing them off completely, which brings a welcome sense of urgency to fights with groups of agitated foes. This is perhaps best exemplified by a late game ride on an underground drilling platform, with hordes of attackers that set upon you from all sides and instantly power-up as a result of being lashed by the shards of flying rock. It’s definitely one of the most heartrate-ratcheting sequences of the entire journey. But elsewhere my anxiety was stirred by the surprisingly slow so-called ‘quick weapon swap’ function. It routinely let me down during the repeated fights against The Callisto Protocol's twin-headed tank-like mini-boss in which my ammunition reserves were rapidly drained. Tapping left on the D-pad swaps out one equipped weapon for another, but the animation of Jacob holstering a weapon and drawing the next is too long and can be accidentally interrupted, meaning there were many times I’d start a weapon switch but perform a dodge to evade an enemy attack immediately afterwards, and then spring back up into a shooting stance to find myself still armed with the exact same weapon I was attempting to holster. Clumsy control issues aside, The Callisto Protocol’s handful of boss fights are disappointingly one-dimensional and never really blew my mind (although they certainly smashed Jacob’s skull on a number of occasions). There are a number of other smaller quibbles that plague The Callisto Protocol. It’s frustrating that opening chests automatically picks up everything inside, meaning I had to continually hop into the inventory screen to drop the skunk gun ammo I never asked for in order to clear space. It seems a bit antiquated that you can only listen to audio logs while you’re standing still with your head stuck in a menu, instead of having them serve as eerie accompaniments to your exploration as they are in games like <a href=""/dead-space-2008"">Dead Space</a> and <a href=""/bioshock"">BioShock</a>. And although having a facehugger leap out of the locker you’re searching might have been a great idea for a jump scare the first time, by the sixth or seventh time it’s just plain annoying, and feels like you’re being forced to endure the same repeated office pranks of an alien April Fool’s day. Lastly, while its eight-hour runtime feels about right in terms of pacing, there’s precious little to do in The Callisto Protocol after you’ve beaten the story. While a New Game+ mode is apparently coming via a free patch at a later date, for now there are no interesting unlockables to speak of that might encourage repeat playthroughs, or any alternative modes to try, making the overall package at launch feel almost as slim as a prison cell mattress. The Callisto Protocol is a supremely atmospheric and action-heavy tour through a spectacular slaughterhouse set in distant space. Its largely linear design makes for minimal backtracking, meaning it trims the fat while leaving no shortage of bone and gristle to rip and tear. However, it also betrays its survival horror roots by regularly tipping the balance of power too far in favour of the player, and while there’s plenty of murderous fun to be had using giant grinding mechanisms to make mulch out of mutants, such cheap thrills come at the high cost of puncturing any tension and dread that the tremendous art and audio design work so hard to invoke. Aside from the meaty melee combat, there’s also the overriding sense that there’s not a lot here that hasn’t been done before – and there’s disappointingly little to do once you’ve beaten the campaign. Thus The Callisto Protocol is a satisfyingly gory spiritual successor to the Dead Space series, but it’s ultimately more of a striking modern mimic than a scary new mutation. "
World of Warcraft: Dragonflight Review in Progress,7,"Most recent World of Warcraft expansions started with a tightly scripted, story-heavy, and somewhat bothersome on-rails scenario. Dragonflight seems to have remembered that this is an MMORPG and I should be deciding what kind of adventures I want to go on. Right off the boat onto the expansive, beautiful Dragon Isles, you'll be met with only minimal handholding and four huge, exciting zones to explore. But at the same time, Dragonflight feels like a creative step backwards from the experimental – though not always successful – spirit of <a href=""/world-of-warcraft-shadowlands-pc/41859/review/world-of-warcraft-shadowlands-review-in-progress"">Shadowlands</a>. There's no denying that the new zones are downright gorgeous. The contrast between volcanic wastelands and verdant river valleys in The Waking Shores is a breathtaking introduction to the expansion. And these locales feature some of the best side quest writing I've seen in WoW in a long time. One of my favorite quests involved sitting and listening to a red dragon, shapeshifted into a humble dwarf, talk about all his regrets and the pain of being banished from his homeland for 10,000 years.  Another one I loved involves traveling slowly, on foot, with a centaur clan to their sacred meeting grounds, complete with a pit stop for a hunting competition. These kinds of heartfelt, memorable moments really are World of Warcraft at its absolute best. They seem to be here to lovingly bonk you over the head and remind you to take your time, simply exist in this beautiful world for a moment. Unfortunately, these handcrafted experiences will dry up after a week or two and you'll be repeating the same, rote daily quests over and over waiting for the next patch to drop, so it's hard to give them too much credit. WoW has generally done a very good job in most expansions making the journey to max level memorable and exciting. And if that's all it needed to be, Dragonflight would hit it out of the park. But as a living MMO, WoW consistently struggles to maintain that level of engagement for me in the weeks and months to come, and Dragonflight is not really any exception. Where Dragonflight really does try to spread its wings, figuratively and literally, is in the design of the new Dracthyr Evoker class. And I have to admit, they're pretty freaking cool. Having a racial soar ability and signature, dragon-themed attacks like Deep Breath let you come screaming out of the skies and bathe your enemies in fire before they even know what hit them. It's simply awesome. However, both the damage-dealing Devastation and healing-focused Preservation specs suffer from having too many niche-use combat abilities and can feel very chaotic and disorienting to play. Especially compared to WoW's last hero class, the delightfully straightforward Demon Hunter, Evokers are just a bit overdesigned. Where the Dracthyr can glide, however, the new dragon riding system allows all of your characters to soar. Zooming over the landscape at up to three times the speed of WoW's traditional ""flying"" mounts, I feel like I can't ever go back to that old system. It feels incredible when you're soaring, banking, and diving around with a palpable sense of momentum and physicality that WoW normally lacks. Dragon riding challenge courses with cosmetic rewards for the best times have easily been some of my favorite parts of this expansion. Though I found it was a bit too easy to get gold on all of them, leaving me with little reason to go back.I'm not a huge fan of how these dragons control on a mouse and keyboard, though. They seem to be begging for controller support, which has long been rumored but never actually manifested. The main story, so far, hasn't exactly wowed me as much as the side quests. If you didn't follow all of the out-of-game lore leading up to Dragonflight, you might be a bit confused about why you're even here in the first place. There is some tension between the major good guys, but it rings kind of hollow. The new bad guys, the primal dragons and their humanoid minions, the Primalists, haven't yet made an impression as especially complex or interesting villains. There does at least seem to be some sort of succession crisis brewing within the Black Dragonflight that has the promise of delivering interesting stories down the line. The eight new dungeons are relatively straightforward and unmemorable, with the standout being The Nokhud Offensive in which you use your dragon riding skills to soar around and intervene in a battle that takes up a huge, instanced portion of the Ohn'ahran Plains zone. They seem to have been designed to avoid the problem of pick-up groups insisting on wacky routes that skip most of the trash fights by exploiting the level geometry, which was a big issue in Shadowlands. But overall, these dungeons are just kind of… meh. On the bright side, the new Mythic+ season is bringing back four legacy dungeons from <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/04/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mists of Pandaria</a>. Keeping things fresh by letting us revisit some of the best content from WoW's 18-year history is such a no-brainer, and I hope they keep it up. The first raid, Vault of the Incarnates, hasn't exactly taken my breath away yet either. There are some interesting and satisfyingly difficult mechanics to learn: one encounter involves a council of elemental sorcerers who have to be killed almost simultaneously in a nod to Molten Core's classic Core Hounds fight, while another involves a giant rock elemental who must be tricked into destroying his own damaging towers with a smash attack. The complexity of the fights is just about right for normal mode, and the visual design of the bosses is pretty strong, but I didn't find the vault itself that interesting in terms of its art or overall theme – especially when you compare it to something like Shadowlands' debut raid, Castle Nathria. There's nothing particularly notable about any of the individual arenas and I don't even know who most of these jerks are! It's worth noting at the time of writing that I haven't yet seen the final fight with Razageth, though. The new crafting system is probably the best it's ever been in WoW's history, with varying qualities of materials and different results for finished products based on your skill level and progression choices. When I make myself a pair of Tier 5 leather pants, I know every stat on those bad boys is as high as it is because my Leatherworking skill is so much higher than the recipe calls for, because I specialized into leather pants specifically, and because I chose to use only the finest bear asses in their manufacture. Though I suspect, as you can eventually max out everything, that this specialness will diminish the longer the expansion sticks around. The problem is, it's still very grindy. Dragonflight has tried to respect our time more by giving us fewer daily chores to do, with even standard ""daily"" quests resetting once or twice a week instead of every 24 hours. But for crafters, you're still expected to farm the same overworld monsters for dozens of hours just to make one piece of epic gear, on top of the fact that the new Spark of Ingenuity item only lets you make one per week anyway. This would be the perfect place to plug in something like Shadowlands' Maw zone or randomized solo dungeons in the spirit of Torghast. Or make them a reward for doing repeatable dragon riding challenges! Anything skill-based, rather than farming the same unchallenging mobs forever like I'm in Purgatory. C'mon Blizzard, I'm begging you. It's not 2004 anymore and this is not good gameplay. I can hear the cries of, ""Choreghast!"" already. But there has to be a happy medium here somewhere. Mostly solo players like me should be able to have those kinds of features available to us without making players who don't like them feel obligated to do them constantly. Blizzard could let us use our progress in what I'll call ""high-end solo content"" as a substitute, not an addition to, other ways to boost our weekly vault earnings, for instance. You can run this randomized, Hades-style dungeon with temporary, collectible power-ups or do Mythic+, but no one has to do both. It sounds like a win-win. Or, even better, they could make it an efficient way to farm stuff like Awakened elemental materials, as a replacement for the plainly worse gameplay of putting on a podcast, zoning out, and farming overworld mobs or flying around looking for dirt piles for hours on end. Stuff like Torghast, in particular, made me feel listened to as a type of player who usually isn't a priority in the admittedly difficult balancing act Blizzard must play satisfying so many players. Did it need more iteration? Of course. But Dragonflight absolutely suffers in my eyes for providing no equivalent. Cutting stuff like Covenant Sanctums, the mission table, and having to keep track of 200 different currencies was wise. But they cut too much here. Dragonflight reignites the sense of wonder and exploration that originally drew me to World of Warcraft, for about the first 30 or 40 hours. Beyond that, it definitely starts to feel a bit threadbare. Dragon riding is fun as hell, and I love the design of the new zones. But this expansion's back-to-basics approach is very much a double-edged sword. I probably won't burn out as fast because there aren't a million things to do every day just to feel like I'm keeping up like there were in Shadowlands. But at the same time, I don't feel like there's enough to do that's genuinely interesting once I've cleared all the very well-written side quests. An excellent new crafting system is gated behind mind-numbing amounts of mindless grinding for resources, in addition to weekly caps, which feels like a double jeopardy situation. I like Dragonflight, but I fell out of love with it not long after hitting max level. I really hope Blizzard looks at this as a rebuilding year for WoW, and doesn't hesitate to iterate on some of the inventive ideas in Shadowlands that were maybe only a step or two away from being great. "
Marvel's Midnight Suns ,8,"One of my favorite things about watching superheroes duke it out is when someone gets smacked so hard they fly backwards and crash through solid walls, explode tanker trucks, or slam into their friends. It’s an awesome demonstration of just how strong these godlike characters are supposed to be, and it’s always a disappointment when a superhero game doesn’t quite capture that feeling. With Marvel’s Midnight Suns, however, Firaxis has built a deep and innovative turn-based tactical combat system around the joy of having Iron Man, Dr. Strange, Blade, and more knock enemies around like toys they're trying to break – and that hasn’t gotten old in the roughly 75 hours of its surprisingly expansive RPG campaign. A lot of that time isn’t spent in battles, though, and while it’s certainly appealing to get up close and personal with this cast of more than a dozen popular and lesser-known Marvel heroes, it does tend to go a bit overboard with convincing Earth’s mightiest heroes to all be your BFFs.   The full-on supernatural theme of Midnight Suns immediately sets it apart from the Marvel games we’ve gotten in recent years. This story is very loosely based on the Marvel Comics series Midnight Sons, and centers on the corrupt witch Lilith returning from the dead to claim the Darkhold (the evil spell book featured in Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness) on behalf of an even more evil god. That apocalyptic mystical threat isn’t terribly novel in of itself, but the family relationships around it make it more interesting: Lilith is the mother of our character, a Commander Shepard-style blank slate known as The Hunter, and her sister is Caretaker, a powerful witch who serves as the Midnight Sun’s Professor X-like mentor. There’s a lot of history between them to delve into – literally, in that Lilith and Caretaker are hundreds of years old and date back to the Salem Witch Trials – and the story uses Lilith’s ability to twist the minds of heroes and villains alike to great effect in creating strife and division among our heroes. With such a long campaign – at least 60 hours, but I’m at more like 75 or 80 now – just about everybody in the cast gets some time to shine, from the world-famous Spider-Man to the more obscure magical heroes like the Runaways’ Nico Minaru and Colossus’ sister Illyana “Magik” Rasputin, who both take central roles in the fight against Lilith. Right off the bat, Midnight Suns’ style of combat is radically and refreshingly different from Firaxis’ genre-defining XCOM games. For one thing, each member of your three-person team you take on a typical mission has their own customizable deck of eight cards representing everything from Spider-Man’s THWIP!!! web-stunning attack to Dr. Strange’s Winds of Watoomb tornado, forcing you to think on your feet in order to make the best possible use of the hand you’re dealt. As a big fan of card games like Slay the Spire and Monster Train (and recently Marvel Snap) I’m absolutely on board with this idea – the unpredictability of it keeps me from falling into the rut of repeating the same routine every battle once I find something effective. Having just a few cards in your hand isn’t as limiting as you might think, since you can discard and redraw any at least a few every turn to replace those that aren’t useful in your situation (and you can increase the number of redraws per turn with consumable items or card upgrades). It’s rare that I’ve found myself unable to act, and it’s not unusual that you’ll draw exactly the card you want. Another excellent aspect of this system is that all your characters draw from the same pool of (usually) three “card plays” and one movement action per turn. That means that one person getting knocked out doesn’t instantly reduce your available actions by a third – you lose access to that hero’s cards, but those who are left standing can still use all of the turn’s allotted moves. So you’re at a disadvantage until you can revive them, but it’s not so great that you’re pulled into the downward spiral of failure that can happen in XCOM and other squad-based games – but it certainly doesn’t mean Midnight Suns is easy. Superheroes don’t take cover in a fight and they don’t miss their shots, so instead of getting entrenched and using suppressive fire to win shootouts, these mostly small-scale missions are exciting slugfests where staying alive is all about quickly taking enemies out – or at least weakening them before they get to move. Directing their attacks away from your weakest hero with taunts and buffing your allies with armor and resistances is key to mitigating the damage, and a lot of the guesswork is taken out of it by icons above enemies' heads indicating who they plan to attack on their turn. The rhythm of combat involves picking off weak fodder enemies using basic attack and skill cards (those with the “quick” trait refund your card play if you knock out a target, extending your turn) to build up Heroism points, which can then be spent on powerful Heroic cards like a hail of missiles from Iron Man’s shoulders that damages every enemy on the screen or Wolverine's armor-piercing claws, or satisfying environmental attacks like dropping a street lamp on a group of enemies or vaulting off a table to come crashing down on a target from above. It’s fantastic when it all comes together to let you clear out one of these close-quarters arena maps before the inevitable wave of enemy reinforcements charges in from off-screen to keep the action going. Firaxis’ animators have done an excellent job of making these turn-based fights feel energetic. That so much of it is built around smacking enemies with extreme force works extremely well with high-powered heroes like Iron Man and Captain Marvel, and using Spider-Man’s webs to fling objects into bad guys’ faces from across the map is very on-brand. With all of that knockback in play positioning is extremely important – you have to think about how to approach a target and how to set up more damaging hits. On that note, I love how every hero has a distinctive flavor to the way they move and attack, whether it’s flying, levitating, teleporting, or swinging, and the powerful team-up attacks put on a good show as two heroes take turns beating the living hell out of a target. When you scale up to the over-the-top late-game abilities the animations are a whole lot of fun to watch, and it's all set to a rousing Avengers-esque score. Mixing heroes like Magik and Ghost Rider into your squad gives you the ability to open portals in the floor (into Limbo and/or Hell) and kick enemies into it for an instant knockout, which is one of the few major places in Midnight Suns where a roll of the dice determines if an attach is successful or not. Considering this requires you to spend a move and may not do any damage at all, it’s a gamble – but it can pay off big if you can remove a beefy enemy from the map in one move.  While the maps you do battle on are consistently small and flat with only a handful of objects on them for you to slam enemies with or into, there are a fair number of backdrops to keep visual diversity up and a good variety of objectives beyond simply defeating all the enemies. There are hazards that make you keep your squad moving to avoid danger zones, shield-bearing enemies that have to be broken through to reach a target, Hydra VIPs that must be captured, bombs that must be disabled, and so on. You can also keep things interesting on straightforward battles by opting into side objectives where you need to, for example, use a specific character to deal 250 damage within two turns. Between those factors and occasional boss encounters with Venom, Sabertooth, Crossbones, and more – each with their own unique mechanics – missions rarely felt like I was stuck in a loop. Of course, Midnight Suns’ combat does have some annoying quirks to get used to: because positioning is so important it's a bit frustrating that you can’t really control where your characters will land after an attack (though it does preview the location for you before you play a card), and because there’s no grid it can be a pain to find the exact right place to cast an area-of-effect attack to hit multiple targets or to get an environmental attack to line up just right. The main thing that still throws me off, though, is that it’s easy to accidentally move a character when you’re trying to make them shove an enemy, and once you do that you've burnt that shove move for this turn. While I’ve come to love it, I admit that Midnight Suns' battles did take a little while to grow on me. The opening hours are a lot to take in, and at the same time you’re trying to wrap your head around this dramatically different new combat system you’re barraged with what feels like way too many currencies for upgrades (each of the three card types has its own) and relationships and other stats to manage, and of course each character’s individual deck of cards – including Hunter’s, which are a mixture of light and dark cards that give you a good range of options for how you’d like them to play, focusing on support abilities that heal or grant armor or going all-in on damage dealing. I also made the mistake of taking on a lot of early side missions, which turns out to be unwise because a lot of things that haven’t been unlocked at that stage. For example, if you don't unlock the ability to do extra damage by knocking an enemy into one of your own teammates you're just making things harder than they need to be. When Venom randomly showed up in an already difficult situation (boss characters can drop into normal missions unexpectedly, similar to XCOM 2’s Chosen) it took me around two hours of stubbornly retrying it to figure out how to survive that mission.  But by the time I’d made my way through the first act of the surprisingly long story, things had really clicked into place, and I found myself greatly enjoying the challenge of maximizing the potential of the hands I’m dealt. Having a wider selection of cards to work with and the ability to upgrade and augment them with bonuses, like increasing their power when you spend a redraw on them or inflicting bleeding on a target, expanded my options significantly and made each character feel more tailored to my preferred style.  I did end up having to tone the difficulty down during that second act. I’d ambitiously cranked it up three levels as they’d unlocked based on my scores in some early missions, but when the generic Hydra soldiers were replaced by a bigger variety of tougher demonic enemies (such as the creepy guys who can clone themselves and others) I started hitting walls where my current understanding of how to optimize a deck just wasn’t up to the task. So I went back down to just one notch above the default for the rest of my run, and that put me in a good place – but I’m looking forward to a future playthrough (maybe when the planned DLC characters Deadpool, Storm, Venom, and Morbius arrive) where I can plan out my decks with a better understanding of how upgrades work and which cards I can sacrifice for extra resources to level up and enhance the ones I like. Turning up the difficulty increases your rewards for beating missions quickly and without anyone getting knocked out, and it’s a really smart system. Doing well doesn’t make you much stronger (if you’re doing that well you don’t need a lot of help there anyway), it just makes you look cooler doing it by increasing the amount of Gloss currency you have to spend on unlocking new costumes and leisure wear for Hunter and the rest of the gang, among other things. With at least a few costume options for everyone, each with multiple color palettes, to earn it’s a good incentive to push yourself to improve on the battlefield. Before you can pay Gloss to enable them, though, you have to find those cosmetic items, and most of them come from exploring the grounds around the Midnight Suns’ home base, a castle-like building known as the Abbey. I generally enjoyed the parallel story that unfolds here, wherein the ghost of Agatha Harkness sends you looking for clues to missing memories of Hunter and Lilith’s previous conflict, and retracing the events that lead to her own death. It’s certainly a major change of pace from battles, though that’s not always a good thing because it can feel like a big time-sink: there’s a lot of aimless wandering alone across the moderately sized, maze-like map, which is almost entirely devoid of NPCs of any kind, as you search for pieces of puzzles. During that time I encountered a few frustrating bugs where items weren’t interactable at first or a solution didn’t work until I tried it multiple times. Also, while there’s a set of four different powers you get here that aren’t available at all in combat, they aren’t used very creatively and mostly serve to unlock areas that’ve been gated off. It becomes very straightforward that you need to use the Open spell to open locked doors, the Purify spell to clear obstructions made of vines, and Reveal whenever you see the eye symbol.  The third major part of Midnight Suns is the aggressive befriending of everyone on the team, and it’s here that things can become a bit awkward. We do get to explore every hero’s backstory and what led them to join the Suns, along with interpersonal conflicts between the visiting Avengers and the resident magic users, and a lot of that is done well and brings depth to the characters. The writing is usually strong and often funny – Tony Stark and Dr. Strange have some of the best banter as they work to solve problems with their technological and magical approaches, Nico’s rebelliousness puts her constantly at odds with Caretaker, and Blade is dark and intense but also nursing a secret crush. There’s a lot to like about each of them, even the vacuous young Ghost Rider, Robbie Reyes, and the voice acting holds it all up fairly well. These iterations of known characters feel distinct; the only one I’d accuse of doing an impersonation of their Marvel Cinematic Universe counterpart is Tony Stark. Having recently replayed the Mass Effect trilogy I couldn’t help but notice a fair amount of similarity to how you chat up your teammates and earn points for being a goodie-two-shoes or an abrasive jerk at every opportunity (or taking the more neutral option), with each character having their own preference for how they’d like you to act. Nico, for example, is generally fishing for a dark answer when she’s venting about Caretaker, while Steve Rogers is exactly what you’d expect. Like nearly everything else, that system feeds into combat by unlocking items that give Hunter passive bonuses, so there’s a good reason to be consistent with your choices even if you’re not into roleplaying.  As for Hunter, they aren't a bad character, but they’re kind of set up for failure by being placed next to legendary comic book heroes like Iron Man, Captain America, and Spider-Man, among others that we already know and love – they never really stood a chance of being as memorable. My Hunter – a male who almost exclusively chooses the “light” dialogue options (my standard choice for a first playthrough of a game like this) – tends to alternate between a self-serious crusader against his mother’s evil and kind of a goofy dork who always wears sunglasses at night, and that was kind of endearing. I don't expect a dramatic change in how events play out when I eventually revisit it with a different approach, though. What made me cringe here and there, though, was the fact that so much of Midnight Suns is spent getting all of these heroes to really like Hunter. It takes on the tone of self-insertion fan fiction, where you write a story in which you get to meet all your favorite characters and they’re constantly telling you how cool you are and how much they love being friends with you. To be fair, we see a lot of this same relationship-building in other similar party-based RPGs of the BioWare style, but in this case the fact that our character is the only one who isn’t drawn from the existing Marvel Comics universe and largely already know each other gives it a bit of a different flavor when everyone is quickly fawning over you. Of course, there’s gameplay value in participating in all of the various book clubs and surprise parties and soaks in the Abbey’s grotto pool: leveling up friendships unlocks powerful passive abilities for each character when in combat and eventually unlocks their Midnight Suns costumes and most powerful card, so it’s worthwhile. Speaking of payoffs, though, it’s odd that in a game where we spend so much time buttering up a group of mostly attractive people by showering them with compliments and thoughtful gifts suited to their interests, and unlocking their swimsuit options, all of these friendships are completely platonic. (I believe canonically makes our character the only person Tony Stark hasn’t tried to bang.) There are quite a few conversations, especially with Magik, where it seemed poised to take a romantic turn but nothing came of it, and that can be anticlimactic coming from games like Mass Effect, Dragon Age, and The Witcher. I wouldn’t be at all surprised if Marvel vetoed the idea of romance options with its established characters, but as it is a more appropriate superhero name for Hunter might’ve been Captain Friendzone. With Marvel’s Midnight Suns, Firaxis has put itself in the league of RPG developers like BioWare, Obsidian, Bethesda, and Larian. Its innovative turn-based hero combat system takes a bit of time to get going, but once it does it makes excellent use of card game mechanics to keep battles fresh, evolving, and unpredictable over the course of an epic-length campaign – bashing enemies into things for increased damage is endlessly entertaining. The supernatural apocalypse story is given emotional weight by the family relationship between the hero and villain at the heart of it. Building intense friendships with famed Marvel superheroes we’ve seen in comics, movies, and games for decades does tend to feel forced and weird, but learning all their backstories and conflicts with teammates can be intriguing, and the fact that nearly everything you do outside of combat makes you more powerful in the next fight means it all tends to be worth doing.

Gungrave G.O.R.E ,6,"Gungrave G.O.R.E has exactly one mission objective, three words that flash across the screen at the beginning of each level and every time you die: Kick their ass. For the 12-15 hour campaign, you’ll do exactly that – shoot, slash, blow up, and otherwise execute thousands of enemies and bosses on your quest to eradicate the Raven Clan and save the world from an evil drug called SEED. When it works, which is often, Gungrave G.O.R.E is a captivating ballet of blood and bullets that merges Gungrave’s signature style with the best aspects of modern action games. Unfortunately, for everything Gungrave G.O.R.E does right, there are an equal number of frustrations and missed opportunities, making it difficult to recommend to anyone outside of action game aficionados or hardcore Gungrave fans. Gungrave G.O.R.E picks up where Gungrave VR and Gungrave VR U.N left off. You don’t have to have played any previous Gungrave games or seen the anime adaptation to pick up what G.O.R.E is laying down, though it will definitely help – if you’re new to the series, there’s a short video explaining its history to help you along. The setup is a bit goofy: SEED, a drug with a knack for transforming its users into monsters that was thought to be eradicated, has actually survived. This time, it’s being sold by the Raven Clan, so Mika, Beyond the Grave (Grave to his friends, and your main protagonist), Dr. Aso, newcomer Quartz, and the rest of the rather forgettable El-Al Canhel head to Scumland to stop SEED production and take the Raven Clan, and its four bosses, down.  Things escalate from there, of course, but Gungrave G.O.R.E’s plot and characters are never strong enough to provoke more than passing interest in what’s going on. Grave is silent as his namesake (he has less than five lines in the entire game, none more than four words long), and the other characters are mostly there to deliver exposition. It doesn’t help that the voice acting is also all over the place and the translation is pretty hit or miss – there are noticeable grammar errors in the written text and weird turns of phrase that don’t sound natural in English. Almost all of G.O.R.E’s story is delivered in cutscenes. In missions, you’ll mostly just have Quartz guiding you from point A to point B with a lot of recycled and unhelpful dialogue like “Grave. They are coming from all sides!” or “There’s the exit,” which gets old pretty fast. G.O.R.E’s story is only there to give you a reason to travel the world, meet new people, and kill them. The action is really what you’re here for, and Gungrave G.O.R.E does more or less deliver on that. Grave has several abilities at his disposal: a pair of pistols, a charged shot, a big coffin to swing around for various three-hit combos, Demolition Shots (special abilities that cost charges you build up by dealing damage), the ability to reflect certain projectiles, a dodge, and a jump. Pretty standard stuff, but what makes Grave interesting to play are his special abilities. You can grab enemies with Death Hauler, Grave’s coffin, and use them as a human shield, or enter Burst Mode by shooting repeatedly while standing still, which allows Grave to deal massive amounts of damage very quickly. Grave can’t move in Burst Mode, but you can rotate the camera to take out enemies around you. Grave can also execute enemies at low health, which will recover his shield much faster than if you recharge it over time. Of course, it’s not just about killing enemies; you have to look stylish doing it, too. The goal is to drive up Grave’s Beat Count as high as you can by constantly hitting enemies and grabbing a high Art score, which comes from executions, melee combo finishers, and Demolition Shots. Maintaining a high Beat Count is tricky; it disappears very quickly if you’re not hitting or shooting something, which pushes you to constantly be on the attack. It’s a fun challenge to drive it up during encounters and then maintain it between them by shooting objects in the environment, like cars, boxes, or neon signs. Play your cards right, and it’s possible (if difficult) to drive up your Beat Count into the thousands. Getting your Beat Count over 50 even gives you access to Storm Barrage, a rapid-fire attack that hits enemies in all directions and will quickly drive your Beat Count higher when used against large groups. The trick is managing all of it. Demolition Shots, for instance, restore health but don’t contribute to your Beat Count, no matter how many enemies you hit with one, though they do give you Art score. Executions provide a shield recharge and up your Art score, but only add one to the Beat Count. Managing all of these things well, along with Grave’s health and shield, can feel great when it all comes together. The shooting is loud and impactful, Demolition Shots are amazing, and executions are appropriately stylish and gory. Melee attacks never quite feel as weighty or damaging as they should, but when you’re pulling off high Beat Counts and landing Demolition Shots, Gungrave G.O.R.E feels fantastic. Unfortunately, everything else is more mixed. Levels are gorgeous, and Gungrave G.O.R.E takes you through a ton of different environments throughout its campaign, from the dirty alleys of Scumland to neon-soaked streets of Hong Kong and the forests of Vietnam, among others. Each place looks, feels, and plays a little differently, and Studio Iggymob has done a great job of imbuing each location with a distinct vibe. The issue is that levels themselves are entirely linear affairs; there are side rooms and small detours, but there’s no reason to ever explore them unless there are enemies there. There are no collectibles to find, no optional objectives to complete, nothing. All you need is kill, which is good because that’s all you're going to do. The other problem is the enemies themselves. You’ll have seen most of the enemies Gungrave G.O.R.E has to offer by the time you hit the 10th level (of 31 total), and many of the ones you’ll see after that are just variations. Instead of “guy with rocket launcher,” you might see “guy with rocket launcher that shoots four rockets,” or “guy with rocket launcher that shoots really fast and does lots of damage.” Instead of your standard, SEED-infused Orgman bruiser, you might see one with claws that moves faster and hits harder. These variations aren’t a problem on their own, but when levels reuse the same few enemies over and over again, it can get old. This is especially noticeable in the last few levels, which feature a grand total of four enemy types. Gungrave G.O.R.E also likes to throw enemies at you that have to be dealt with in specific ways, greatly limiting your combat options. If an enemy is equipped with a shield, for example, you cannot under any circumstances break that shield by shooting at it normally. You have to hit it with melee attacks, a charged shot, deflect a rocket into it, use an environmental explosion, or use specific Demolition Shots. That might not sound bad, but melee attacks are slow and will often miss enemies they should hit, a charged shot requires that you stop shooting long enough to charge it, which means potentially losing your Beat Count, and Demolition Shots are a resource. Even then, Demolition Shots and charged shots will often only destroy a single shield, even if you hit multiple shielded enemies with those attacks. And you have to deal with them immediately; Grave may be powerful, but he’s also slow, and shielded enemies will run right up in your face to stop you from targeting their friends, knock you down, and hit you out of – or sometimes through – your attacks. Worse still, all of that just gets rid of the shield itself. You still have to kill the guy holding it after the fact. Enemies with powerful guns or rocket launchers are the same way. If you don’t deal with them immediately, you’re probably going to die because G.O.R.E loves to have several of them attack you at a time, their attacks are very difficult to dodge (you can’t really dodge a guy with a machine gun, and rockets basically have to be deflected because they track you) and they hit really hard. All of this makes combat less about using all of Grave’s options and more about using whatever the “right option” to deal with that specific type of enemy is. Gungrave G.O.R.E is better when it’s letting you come up with creative solutions to encounters, but enemies like this shut that down completely. Boss encounters are much better. G.O.R.E offers a huge variety of bosses to fight, some of which have several phases. Barring a couple of exceptions later on, each is extremely unique and almost all of them are quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, levels don’t start regularly having boss fights until you’re more than halfway through the campaign. Most of the time, a stage will end with a big fight against a ton of smaller enemies, or just stop once you reach a certain point. The former is fine, but the latter is incredibly jarring and can really take you out of the experience. I wish I could say that all of the levels themselves were great, but they’re also extremely hit-and-miss. In general, Gungrave G.O.R.E tends to get better as it goes on, but even that feels like an incomplete description. Early levels, however, are definitely less fun; most of them lack boss fights, and G.O.R.E has a bad habit of throwing gimmicks at you. One level, for instance, requires Grave to navigate the top of a moving train, avoiding passing signs and oncoming tunnels. This is fine in theory, but Grave is a slow character, and he’s strongest when he isn’t moving. Taking out the enemies around you efficiently, especially early on, when you have a limited moveset, means standing still to use Burst Mode, which opens you up to running into a passing sign or not getting inside the train before you hit a tunnel. Hitting a sign is bad (it will cost you all of your shield and about half of your health) but being atop the train when it goes into a tunnel means instant death and having to redo the entire segment. Avoiding the signs and trying to move quickly opens you up to enemies with rocket launchers and shields, both of which do high damage and can knock you off the train, which, you guessed it, results in instant death and having to do the entire section again. Difficulty spikes like these make the early game incredibly frustrating. Generally, you’re not dying because you made a mistake, but because you don’t yet have the tools or abilities to deal damage quickly enough. By far the worst example I ran into was the sixth level, where Grave has to hold off a large group of what are, at the time, a lot of really tough Raven Clan enemies. I spent over an hour attempting this segment, but no matter what I did, I couldn’t deal enough damage fast enough. There were simply too many enemies in too small an area, all of whom demanded I deal with them in a specific way, which usually left me vulnerable to something else. I eventually had to turn the difficulty on that encounter down a notch, and that suddenly let me clear it on the first try. Gungrave G.O.R.E actually encourages you to switch difficulties if things get too tough, but it feels bad when the reason you have to do so is that your damage output isn’t up to some arbitrary standard because it didn’t give you enough points to buy the upgrades you need yet. When I came back to that same level later with more abilities, I was able to beat it on the normal difficulty pretty easily. Speaking of upgrades, you can buy them at the end of each level or from the main menu. You gain points by completing levels, and G.O.R.E scores you in five categories: time, kill rate, life remaining, highest Beat Count, and Art Score on a scale from D to S. It then averages the results for a final score, and points are awarded based on how well you do. Initially, it’s hard to score well – you simply don’t have the abilities you need to maintain high Beat Counts (for reference: a Beat Count in the 300s on most levels will earn you a C) or Art scores, but it becomes easier as you unlock abilities. Once you have points to spend, you can head to The Lab. There’s a lot to buy: health, shield, and damage upgrades, new melee combos and skills, and new Demolition Shots. As you purchase new stuff, G.O.R.E opens up considerably, and combat becomes much easier and more enjoyable. You can also refund your abilities at any time for their full purchase price, which can be very helpful if you’re stuck. A one-on-one boss fight, for instance, is a lot easier if you max Grave’s targeting range and bullet damage instead of his Storm Barrage, which you’ll mostly use for crowd control and building high Beat Counts against large groups. Unfortunately, all the upgrades can’t hide how limited Grave’s moveset is. He never acquires new weapons – the twin pistols and coffin are it – so his playstyle never really changes. New moves can only iterate on what you already have. G.O.R.E does offer two other playable characters, Bunji and Quartz, but they’re only there for one level each and, in Bunji’s case, a small portion of a later level. Their playstyles are a welcome change-up: Bunji is like a faster Grave who can dodge while in Burst mode, and I enjoyed playing him more than I did Grave. Quartz, on the other hand, is more mixed. She’s a melee character in a game not really built for melee characters, and while her moveset is a nice change of pace, it’s not much more than a novelty. You only get each character for a short time, and you can’t upgrade their abilities or buy them new ones. What they come with is what they get. It feels like a huge missed opportunity, especially since Grave never gets anything to really change up his playstyle – you can’t even rebind your controls if you don’t like how things are set. When you get right down to it, most of Gungrave G.O.R.E feels like a missed opportunity. There’s a great combat system here, but the lack of variety and repetitive enemy design often let it down. The art, courtesy of Trigun’s Yasuhiro Nightow and Ikumi Nakamura, is fantastic and oozes style, but the story told in that attractive setting isn’t very interesting. The music and sound design are largely wonderful, too, but the voice acting is a little uneven. I can easily see its potential, but a mishmash of missteps prevent Gungrave G.O.R.E from ever reaching it. "
Evil West ,7,"When I think about what the real world would be like if it were overrun by vampires, werewolves, and zombie-like shambling corpses, that imaginary apocalypse doesn’t evoke nearly as much maniacal cackling from me as the one in Evil West. From the Tesla-inspired electricity weapons to the gratuitous gore and bloodshed, this old-school action game was some of the most fun monster murdering I’ve done in a while – unfortunately, its formulaic structure also make it some of the most repetitive. Evil West’s roughly 12-hour linear campaign is spread across 16 different missions that all follow the same format. Each level has a clear start and end point with collectibles sprinkled along the way, broken up by throngs of enemies that assail you until you get a dialogue break during the next cutscene. While you’re <i>technically</i> free to explore levels a bit to find lore items or gold pouches, aka “bucks” for purchasing upgrades, the crux of your adventure is walking from one fight to the next and eventually capping missions off with a boss battle. Fortunately, the environments between each combat encounter are truly sights to behold with enough picturesque backdrops that range from the outlandish to the beautiful to make even the grumpiest cowboy shed a tear.  The formula of Evil West’s levels is rarely mixed up save for a few unique situations, such as a wacky mine cart segment or the handful of times you walk around the base camp while being spoon fed exposition. Its story puts you in control of Jesse Rentier from The Rentier Institute, an organization founded by Jesse’s father to hunt down and eradicate all manner of vampires and other foul beasts. Developer Flying Wild Hogs really latched onto the whole “Wild West, but Weird” idea and ran away with it screaming. You’ve got Illuminati-esque floating pyramids, portals to hell, and demonic little girls with skin-crawling voices. It’s a tale riddled with entertaining expletives and truly distinct characters, such as the fiercely opinionated doctor, Emilia Blackwell, so there’s never a dull moment – I just wish the story as a whole was more sophisticated than Jesse simply chasing down some bad people for revenge. Over the course of Evil West you’ll gradually unlock new weapons, powers, and upgrades that alter Jesse’s abilities in fun new ways. For example, you can increase the number of shots your pistol gets off in a single magazine, augment your rifle with electrical damage, and even incorporate new abilities like ground pounds and aerial combos to continue evolving your arsenal. The way combat is always expanding helps break up the otherwise monotonous layouts of Evil West’s levels. There is rarely a stretch of time longer than 20 minutes in which you won’t either unlock a new ability, augment an existing weapon with a fresh effect, or find an entirely new gadget for dismembering enemies in glorious ways. During the review period, Evil West was still rated as “Unsupported” on Steam Deck, but that’s likely because it just hadn’t released and been certified yet. While I primarily played on my desktop PC, I found I vastly preferred using a gamepad over a mouse and keyboard. The UI is clearly designed to reflect a controller layout for quick reference and some commands, like pulling enemies towards you with the electric gauntlet, feel awkward on a keyboard. To that end, I decided to install it on my Steam Deck (I’m using <a href=""https://www.steamdeck.com/en/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><u>the 512GB model</u></a>) and give it a try anyway. You have to use the touchscreen or touchpad to install some Unreal Engine supporting files on first launch, but after that it ran great. It’s already optimized for controller support so all of the UI switched over to gamepad prompts immediately. Performance was a bit all over the place at first. Frames dipped down to the low 20s on Epic or High settings, but after turning off motion blur (yuck), leaving on V-Sync, and lowering to Medium settings it was much better, hovering around 40-60 frames-per-second. Ultimately, I opted for setting a 40 FPS frame limit in the Steam Deck’s performance setting menu to get the most consistent performance. That wasn’t so bad, though my RTX 2060 Super desktop PC was able to play smoothly at 60 fps with no stutters on High settings the vast majority of the time. In addition to that constant evolution, combat has a frantic flow that feels great in motion. You can zoom across the map and stun enemies then rack up a melee combo, uppercut them into the air, and jump up to smash them back down into a pool of blood and guts. Or you can charge up your rifle with a high-powered beam of electricity that ricochets between enemies before unleashing your flamethrower to finish them off. It’s a ludicrous selection of weaponry that’s easy to switch between on the fly since nearly every piece of gear has its own dedicated button and cooldown timer – no ammo or bullets to keep track of. You can just wait for stuff to recharge while using something else. The one part of the combat that did grow a bit dull by the end of Evil West was the lack of enemy variety. Slow-moving zombies with heavy wind up swings never pose a challenge and even the most aggressive hulking monstrosities wielding shields lack oomph after the first few fights. It can even be difficult to tell what’s going on during the most chaotic battles because every enemy bleeds together (pun intended) and they all end up looking like the same tones of blood and mud. (It doesn’t help that the notification arrow to let you know someone is attacking is relatively subtle and easy to miss in the thick of things.) Enemy reuse is particularly noticeable when it comes to larger health sponge enemies too, as Evil West likes to copy-paste baddies that were once bosses into later levels as mini bosses. Sometimes these enemies even attack in packs on subsequent meetings, which is pure chaos and, admittedly, a true symphony of violence. But since every combat encounter is basically just a circular arena you dodge and strafe around as you fight, that gaggle of large health bars could wear my patience thin after a while. With no jump button or variety in how combat encounters are laid out, every fight ends up feeling like the same mushy puddle of goo even with the creative arsenal at your disposal. That doesn’t mean hopping around in that goo (gross) wasn’t fun, it just means this is simply the kind of game you boot up when you don’t want to think. It’s repetitive, predictable, and unoriginal in a lot of ways, but I found myself not caring because I was enjoying killing monsters so much anyway. In that regard, Evil West shares a lot of the same DNA as Flying Wild Hog’s previous chaotic action romp, <a href=""/shadow-warrior-3/54334/review/shadow-warrior-3-review""><u>Shadow Warrior 3</u></a>, even if the genre is entirely different – both games double down on what matters most to obfuscate plenty of other areas that are lacking. Evil West is a refreshing blast from the past that nails the most important parts of its old-school, vampire-hunting action. The combat is smooth and its weapon options are ludicrously entertaining, but low enemy variety and overly similar level layouts can grow somewhat monotonous after a while. This is far from being the most complex or innovative action game I’ve played, but every so often you just want to have some fun smashing in monster skulls. "
Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0 Review in Progress,8,"Two years after the original <a href=""/call-of-duty-warzone-pc/35002/review/call-of-duty-warzone-review"">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> dropped into the battle royale arena, its sequel, Warzone 2.0, has arrived with a new map and some enticing new game modes. Or at least, it would offer those things if network and server issues weren’t preventing me from playing a single full, clean match since its launch on Wednesday. That could just be the typical release window woes, and I’ll be holding off on my full scored review until things have had a chance to settle and I’ve played more, but anyone looking to dive in over the weekend should be prepared for a bumpy landing. Warzone 2.0 is still a battle royale at its center, bringing back a lot of the first game’s mechanics and base features while introducing a few tweaks of its own, like having two or three smaller circles that eventually converge into one. It’s not all familiar though, as the brand new Al Mazrah map nicely incorporates some of the multiplayer stages from <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-multiplayer-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Modern Warfare 2</a>, and the new DMZ mode that takes place on it provides a welcome change of pace from Warzone’s usual last person standing structure.  But while these additions are intriguing to me, I’ve only been able to play a handful of matches on PC where the performance was what I would describe as “almost decent” – and even then I’d face a lot of microstutters and latency issues that kept Warzone 2.0 from feeling smooth. Some people are reportedly having fewer problems than others, but my game would randomly spike to 999 millisecond latency and glue my feet to the ground for a minute so I was unable to move, sometimes making survival during fights near impossible. Somewhat surprisingly, DMZ was the only game mode I could play consistently without having disconnection issues, but even that had latency spikes during matches. DMZ is the new loot and extract sandbox mode, no doubt inspired by the success of games like <a href=""/escape-from-tarkov"">Escape from Tarkov</a>, and it’s actually really fun and refreshing to play between battle royale matches. Being able to fight big groups of NPCs and infiltrate strongholds with my teammate while also keeping an eye on potential enemy players running toward us was exciting. It kept me on my toes in a different way from the usual battle royale mode, and made me want to jump back into the Al Mazrah map to get more loot and keys to unlock strongholds again and again. That appeal could partially be because the battle royale mode itself is currently the most frustrating one to try and play. Matches contain the same whopping cap of up to 150 players total in each mode: Solos, Duos, Trios, or Quads. However, a lot of the time my lobbies wouldn’t fill up enough to launch, so people would get impatient and leave before they did. That meant most of my time trying to play a battle royale match became a never ending cycle of queueing and requeueing to find a server that would fire. When I <i>could</i> enter a match, I was at least able to get a feel for how the mode plays. It’s largely a lot of the same from the original, but that was already a very fun battle royale with solid looting and shooting mechanics that only improved over time. One interesting new addition here is that you can actually recruit enemy players to your team in squad-based lobbies if you end up losing a teammate at any point. This is a clever way to give weakened teams or solo stragglers a fighting chance and keep more people invested in a match for longer. It’s also just fun to make friends in a Battle Royale, which is a bit unexpected in such a cutthroat format. The Unhinged Trios mode even lets you invite up to six people to be on your team mid-match, living up to its “unhinged” descriptor in the chaos that creates. I’m still early in my time with it, but so far Warzone 2.0 seems like a fun evolution of its predecessor whenever I’m able to get into a decently stable server and actually play something close to a full match. I already feel the pull of the new DMZ mode in particular, but I just haven’t been able to play enough yet to find out if that feeling will last. I have had more disconnects and latency issues than any actual game time, with release instability still persisting as we head into the weekend. Hopefully Warzone 2.0’s servers and desync issues can be resolved soon so I can, you know, actually play more of it, and I’ll be back with my final scored review in the next week or two. Building on the already rock-solid foundation of the original Warzone, Warzone 2.0 is a positive update to Call of Duty’s battle royale mode, even with few drawbacks of its own. Its new map isn’t the most exciting outside of being the biggest ever brought to Warzone, but great additions like proximity chat and an updated ping system change things up and bring new life to the struggle for survival. And while adding backpacks as lootable gear may have slowed down looting in general, the new take on the Gulag creates some memorable moments if you can convince your fellow prisoners to team up against a common enemy for the greater good. And, as an added bonus, the new DMZ extraction mode revitalizes Warzone by appealing to people who might not want to sweat through full battle royale matches every time, but still want to level weapons and get a quick taste of that fight for survival. "
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet Review in Progress,6,"Before I started Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, I didn’t quite believe they would actually let me wander off in any old direction like developer Game Freak claimed I could. Even with the increasingly open nature of recent Pokémon games like <a href=""/pokemon-sword/31215/review/pokemon-sword-and-shield-review"">Sword, Shield,</a> and <a href=""/pokemon-legends-arceus/53345/review/pokemon-legends-arceus-review"">Arceus</a>, this has still been a very linear RPG series, with a set path of challenges and plot points lined up in a neat order. But then I picked up my Fuecoco and ventured out into the Paldea region only to have that disbelief completely shattered. After a few years of experimentation on the Switch, Game Freak has finally stumbled upon an open world formula that successfully reinvents how Pokémon is played, while remaining true to the nostalgic childhood vision of exploration, adventure, and cute monster collecting. It is, in almost every way, the transformation I’ve been waiting for – but the grievously poor performance that has come along with it significantly mars this otherwise exciting design evolution. After a fairly beefy opening route and some exposition about going to school to become good at Pokémon , you are given three major story paths to follow, each with several objectives you can choose to tackle in any order. It’s not unlike <a href=""/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/1214/review/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild’s</a> structure of opening all four Divine Beasts at once – and similar to heading straight for Hyrule Castle to fight Ganon, you can (as far as I can tell) walk out of your school and run straight to the hardest gym and challenge it, though I wouldn’t actually recommend doing that.  The review embargo for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet has lifted, and while I’ve finished the main story, we’re opting to hold our final, scored review until after launch for a few reasons. First and foremost is that the online features were not available to test ahead of release. While this has been the case for most Pokémon reviews, online has historically been limited to simple things like trading and battling. But with Scarlet and Violet, the ability to simultaneously explore its enormous open world with up to three other players was advertised as one of its new key features. Without online turned on, I don’t know exactly what kinds of things players can do together in that mode, much less how it runs or if it’s any fun. Scoring Scarlet and Violet without testing it out personally would be a considerable omission, so we’re opting to wait until we’ve had a few days with it post-launch to make a final call. In addition to this, the review embargo we agreed to in order to receive early code from Nintendo was strict, and included limitations on what Pokémon we could show in our video review (including not allowing us to show a Pokémon that appears quite commonly on the very first route!). It also restricts us from telling you how long it took to finish the story, a critical piece of information that we endeavor to include in all of our reviews. Given all that, plus the limited amount of time we’ve had with Scarlet and Violet (code arrived less than a week before the embargo lifted), we decided it was best to take a bit more time so we could share our full, unrestricted thoughts in a scored review next week. Pokémon Scarlet and Violet do not include level scaling, so you’ll get destroyed immediately unless you follow the “intended” paths at least a little bit more closely. However, if you do try to take on objectives in precise order of difficulty, you’ll have to do a lot of inconvenient zigging and zagging across the massive Paldea map. What Scarlet and Violet actually seem to promote instead, and what I enjoyed so much about them, was getting gloriously lost. My journey involved accidentally walking into a slightly-too-difficult area early on, but using strategy and care to power through anyway. The first half or so of my adventure was incredibly difficult and rewarding as a result. When I went to work through the areas I had missed, I steamrolled several in a row before I caught up to more level-appropriate challenges again. While I’m not wild about taking on a gym full of level 15 Pokémon with a team of level 35s, the inconsistent difficulty not only evened out by the endgame, it also didn’t detract from my enjoyment much. That’s partially because Scarlet and Violet’s three story paths are all fairly involved and interesting on their own merits (especially compared to the weirdly truncated stories of Sword, Shield, and Arceus), but it’s also because exploring the enormous world was its own delight. Game Freak has taken another big step in the right direction with Scarlet and Violet in making a believable, creature-filled wilderness with a Regional Pokedex bulky enough that I didn’t miss all the National Dex Pokemon it excludes. When I reached areas I was well overleveled for, I still had a great time hunting for items and using the autobattler Let’s Go mode to train up some weaker monsters – or to barrel through a herd of Mudbray. What’s more, the wild behaviors and animations of Pokémon have been improved too. Magikarp swim up to the shoreline only to wash up and flop uselessly on the beach, clusters of Psyduck curiously gather to watch you battle, and Klawf dive bomb you from their perches on cliff faces. While Sword and Shield’s Wild Area looked more like someone spilled a bag of random Pokémon everywhere at times, Scarlet and Violet have monsters traveling believably in herds, clustering around a water’s edge, or hiding up trees more akin to real animals. It was hard to stop myself from spending hours poking around Paldea’s massive “areas” (the far more open evolution of past games’ “routes”) for all the monsters hiding there so I could finish this review. Aside from its phenomenal shift to a true open world, I’ve had one other major takeaway from my time with Pokémon Scarlet and Violet so far that is impossible to ignore: they are a technical mess. In fact, there really isn’t a moment in these games where I’d say they run well. The framerate is all over the place, dipping agonizingly low even when only a few effects such as flowing water or weather are on screen. Character models only a few feet away pop in and out, sometimes rapidly, or chug along at stop motion animation speeds. Everything has a weird, shimmery blur to it, and shadows frequently disappear and reappear suddenly and illogically. Pokémon clip in and out of walls or floors at odd angles, or get stuck in them entirely – I spent an entire Gym Battle with one Pokemon halfway buried in the floor. The camera will occasionally clip through mountainsides and give a full view of a video gamey void, sometimes ruining cool moments (like, for instance, the evolution of my Wooper). Everything lags all the time, from battles to menus to cutscenes. Two of our guides writers have experienced hard game crashes. It is, by far, the worst-running Pokémon game I have ever played, and among the worst-running AAA games I’ve played on the Switch so far. And yes, this is<i> with</i> the day one patch. What’s saddest is that these issues frequently detract from what would otherwise be Scarlet and Violet’s most brilliant, standout moments. It is incredible to be able to stand on top of a huge snowy mountain at the center of a Pokémon region and see a dazzling light show of a gym in the distance one way, a sparkling lake in another, and a towering red mesa in another still, and know that I can go to all three of those places without a single loading screen, simply by taking a leap. A seamless, open Pokémon world we can explore however we like is a dream come true for Pokémon lovers, and for a brief moment I thought I’d be able to put aside all the technical nonsense and just enjoy the plethora of good design choices I’d been waiting for. But the issues are constant, and interrupt almost every moment intended to be spectacular or emotional or fun. For instance, the Paldea region’s biggest and most beautifully designed city where several major story moments play out is one of the most technically janky areas of all. Heck, it’s impossible to simply run around any given grassy field for a minute or two and not be caught off guard by Pokémon models popping in and out or everything suddenly lagging dramatically. And that’s all offline – what happens to it on launch day when I go online with three friends in these already laggy areas? I desperately hope some early patches can clean this mess up and bring it (I can’t believe I’m saying this) more in line with Arceus or Sword and Shield – those games had their technical issues, but they were much more forgivable by comparison. Because Scarlet and Violet <i>are </i>a blast to play, and aside from a few quibbles about the precise way certain systems work, Game Freak largely seems to have figured out what kind of open world design works for the series. It truly delivers on the Pokémon fantasy while embracing a more modern RPG style. Even as I cringed watching NPCs weirdly skate down giant staircases and vanish halfway, I was reveling in Scarlet and Violet’s fantastic story, characters, monsters, and world. I want more Pokémon games that play like this, just not ones that run like this. I am still looking forward to spending a lot more time in Paldea before finalizing my review and putting a score on it next week – especially as I see how the online multiplayer works once it goes live. I just wish this region was the beautiful, expansive, Pokémon-stuffed Paldea the artists and designers clearly envisioned and tried to present to me, and not the slow-moving, muddled, oddly-lit Paldea I’ve been chugging my way through for the last week. i>Rebekah Valentine is a news reporter for IGN. You can find her on Twitter </i><a href=""https://twitter.com/duckvalentine"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><i>@duckvalentine</i></a><i>.</i I’ve been tearing my hair out for two weeks now over how conflicted I feel about Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. The thing is, discovering and catching all these charming monsters across an enormous open world with an actually good story is really fun… it just comes with far, far too many asterisks. I truly believe that the bold new ideas of Scarlet and Violet are fantastic, if unrefined – a belief I also held about Pokémon Legends: Arceus. But in both cases, so many of the pillars holding up those shining concepts – visual quality, open-world details, customization, and technical soundness – are seemingly unfinished or actively crumbling. It is completely impossible to play Scarlet and Violet and not notice at least some of its performance issues. Every minute I was happily running around the grassy fields of Paldea I was also actively cringing at a Pokémon stuck in the floor, wincing at some weird framerate nonsense going on with a nearby wild Pokémon, or groaning at another bout of crippling lag. And the promising online co-op play that could be the start of an exciting new era for the series makes all these problems significantly worse. As a decades-long fan, I desperately want better for Pokémon, especially given how clear it is that the design fundamentals are absolutely there under the surface. But if you’re devoted to this series, as so many are, know that the proper care we’ve all come to expect has not been shown here. "
Goat Simulator 3 ,8,"I don’t know if I’ve ever played something as gobsmackingly unhinged as Goat Simulator 3. Developer Coffee Stain North’s doggedly rebellious attitude is apparent in everything from the incoherent “story” to gameplay so over-the-top that half the time it’s hard to tell what’s happening – even the title refuses to play by the rules, skipping Goat Simulator 2 and going straight to three for no particular reason. Throw in four-player co-op that multiplies the madness to even greater extremes as you run rampant through a large open-world map filled with things to lick, headbutt, and blow up, and you’ve got yourself a game so absurd it’s hard to imagine being bored for even a second. This deranged sequel is bigger, packed with silly jokes and pop culture references, and one of stupidest things I have ever beheld. It was love at first bleat. Like the original, Goat Simulator 3 is an open-world sandbox game that doesn’t even bother with things like a tutorial or having any kind of direction with its ridiculous plot (if you can even call it that). . Instead it lets you and your friends loose on the world and says “go ahead – break it all,” as you complete a series of non sequitur quests and feats of mayhem. You’ll do normal goat stuff like drop a nuclear bomb on a cul-de-sac, or cause a trio of ballerinas to turn into a giant tornado that never goes away for the rest of your adventure, or drive cars into your friends until they explode (both the cars and the friends). However, unlike the first Goat Simulator, this time you <i>are</i> given clear objectives and a quest log that guides you towards leveling up your Illuminati Ranks, upgrading your Goat Castle base, and eventually reaching an incredibly bonkers conclusion after roughly eight hours. The quests are about as insane as you’d expect: in one I was elected President after dragging citizens kicking and screaming into a voting booth with my tongue, while in another I had to infiltrate a facility to unleash a race of anthropomorphic bananas on the world. Oh, and in another, I literally just went bird watching. I really never knew what they were going to throw at me at any given moment, which was delightful.  ""Goat Simulator isn’t much of a game, but it’s a hell of a good time. The small but dense map is packed with tons of jokes and bugs that should be seen rather than talked about, and there’s at least a few hours’ worth of entertainment in goofing around with the jetpack alone. It’s a clever interactive spoof of all the broken game physics we’ve seen in open worlds – almost like a greatest hits album of all the ridiculous bugs that pop up in serious games like Skyrim or Assassin’s Creed, except embraced and celebrated in a world that’s made to be broken."" - <i>Dan Stapleton, April 1, 2014</i Read our full <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/01/goat-simulator-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Goat Simulator review</a>. There’s no health bar and you can’t actually be killed by anything, so there are practically never consequences for anything you do, which can be both a good thing and a bad thing. On the one hand, you can throw yourself at problems with reckless abandon, free from worry that you’ll ever fail at anything – but on the other hand, it also removes any potential challenge, which means you’ll blow through any obstacle before you with relative ease. Instead, the fun comes from inventing creative ways to get things done, like that time I transformed myself into a tiny fish to avoid a security system and pull off a heist. You’ll also complete a list of less important challenges called Instincts that might ask you to get arrested by the police a certain number of times, or light people on fire, or drive a car up a ramp just for the heck of it – all of which make for good, chaotic diversions. You can also search for collectibles out in the world, which are often hidden in places that require jumping off rooftops or some such silliness. That said, you’re given so many insane and overpowered tools it's very easy to find workarounds, like using expandable stilts to simply raise yourself up to something’s level. Once you figure that out, gathering collectibles just becomes a simple scavenger hunt with no challenge to it either. Instincts and collectibles don’t help you increase your Illuminati Ranks or complete the campaign, but they do let you earn some extra Goat Points to buy cosmetics. Some of those even have an impact on gameplay, like a rocket launcher you can wear on your back or butterfly wings that let you glide through the air. Alternatively, you could just buy a skin called Tony Shark that swaps out your goat body for a shark riding a skateboard – whatever floats your goat. One massive improvement over its predecessor is that Goat Simulator 3’s world is significantly larger and even more packed with secrets and chance encounters. Areas include a spooky cemetery filled with ghosts, a large city with skyscrapers to climb, and a wooded area, each of which has their own vibe and list of loopy things to discover. In one hidden area, I played an almost beat-for-beat recreation of <a href=""/pt"">the P.T. demo</a> called Horror Corridor, except with dumb goat goodness instead of a creepy lady. Finding these super weird encounters and Easter eggs is easily the best part of this bizarre sandbox, and often left me in stitches. While Goat Simulator 3 is entertaining enough on its own, the true potential of this big island filled with ridiculousness is opened up when you share it with friends. Not only can you play four-player co-op online, but you’re also able to do so via local splitscreen, and I don’t know if any game has felt more suited for a couch filled with the degenerates I call friends than this one. Causing mayhem with my buddies not only amplifies the chaos with up to four times the number of goat psychos running around, but you can also make progress four times as fast since everyone can tackle missions on completely different parts of the map without issue. Although, more often than not my group just griefed one another instead of being productive. There are also half a dozen competitive minigames, like King of the Hill or The Floor is Lava, which make for some amusing distractions to pass the time, though they’re all pretty basic and lose their allure once you’ve played them a few times – running around the open-world and headbutting cop cars is just way more fun. Really the only major shortcoming of Goat Simulator 3 is that it’s got bugs and poor performance, though honestly even those issues can feel right at home in a sandbox this chaotic. I found my way into objects I wasn’t supposed to get stuck in, rocked the framerate to terrifyingly low levels during moments of especially potent mayhem, and more. Plus, there’s lots of ugly pop-in that makes things seem a bit unpolished in a way that doesn’t feel like part of the joke. These issues were especially bad when playing in splitscreen, where an abundance of goats tested the limits of the world’s stability, but none of them did much to ruin the experience overall. Goat Simulator 3 is the evolution in idiocy I’d hoped for from this iconically weird series. It almost certainly won’t wow you with its level of polish or a deep, meaningful narrative, but sometimes it’s a good idea to turn your brain off and buck your hooves into an old lady’s face while she fires a rocket launcher at you. With a larger map, more ridiculous references and hilarious jokes, and multiplayer that only enhances the ludicrous good times, I can easily recommend this to anyone with a taste for its silly sense of humor and a few hours to kill. "
Somerville ,7,"Somerville is a delightfully bizarre, physics-based puzzle adventure game that was developed by some of the former talent that created Playdead’s pair of modern classics: Limbo and Inside. And yet at the same time it plays very differently from those offerings, reminding me more of the seminal early-’90s classic Out of This World than Limbo or Inside with its upside-down setting, its color palette and character renderings, and its ever-rotating camera orientation from scene to scene. This was a pleasant surprise, though it isn’t nearly as polished or thought-provoking as its progenitors, leaving us with a very good game but ultimately not one I expect to be thinking about for very long now that I’ve finished it. Somerville opens in the most wholesome way possible: A man, a woman, their infant child, and their dog are all on the living room couch, having fallen asleep in front of the TV. You take control of the man, who is never named. In fact, we never hear from him or from anyone else. Like Limbo, Inside, and Out of This World, there is no dialogue; Somerville’s storytelling is entirely visual. And visually, I do love what developer Jumpship has done here. Our nameless, voiceless hero is also essentially faceless, since all of these characters are more like impressionist renderings of people. And yet the use of color – and particularly contrast – makes the world pop when need be, such as when a dash of yellow wordlessly tells you that you can interact with an object.  Sound design, meanwhile, is effective in its minimalism. Aside from the piano soundtrack that’s good at nudging up the drama or tension when Somerville’s designers want it to, the pervading audio you’ll hear is the pained breathing and movement of our hero. Whatever happened to him clearly physically hurts him, and the further into this strange new world he gets, the more pain he’s in. All of this paints a very dark, bleak, and yet intriguing mystery – one where the story wastes no time in ratcheting up the danger with extraterrestrial objects suddenly filling the sky outside of your remote cabin in the opening moments and, well, it only gets mesmerizingly weirder from there. Somerville, then, is a slightly-under-four-hour quest to unravel what the hell just happened and is very much still happening. You’ll need to solve physics-based puzzles using your inexplicably glowing arm’s newfound power – primarily through turning the invading alien architecture into a permeable, water-like substance by shining light on it; specifically, light that’s been supercharged by your arm’s power. Extra layers get added to these powers as you progress, but it’s a bit thin; while it was enough gameplay to keep Somerville out of walking simulator territory, its puzzles aren’t likely to hold you up for more than a few moments at a time. In fact, the one time I did get hung up, it was more of an issue I had wrestling with the physics system than the actual game design. Part of the reason its puzzles never get all that complex is that Somerville keeps its control scheme minimalist: the triggers and one face button are all you’ll ever need. I admire that simplicity – including in the way it keeps its interface nonexistent 99% of the time. Especially in a moody adventure like this, I love when the atmospheric world gets to shine through unobstructed. As a dog lover I was delighted at first by the prospect of having a four-legged wingman, but sadly, your canine companion serves almost no purpose here aside from occasionally and subtly pointing you in the right direction. He doesn’t assist in puzzles or gameplay, he has no impact on the story, and you can’t even pet him at will. There’s value in some companionship in such a lonely world, but it seems like he could’ve been given something more to do. Lonely and isolating as it may be, the altered Earth is, again, pretty. It’s also refreshing to be able to move about freely in each scene’s 3D space, which Somerville mixes up constantly. This is not a left-to-right stage progression; you’ll go up, down, left, and right at various times, and in that respect Somerville does a great job of staving off anything remotely resembling monotony during its short run. That’s a big part of where the aforementioned Out of This World reminder stems from, which was very much a good thing. And like that gem, I was always intrigued by where Somerville’s next scene might take me. Occasionally, though, that freedom results in awkward transitions when you move from one room to the next. Sometimes the room you’re heading into will have a different camera angle that causes you to move in the opposite direction, right back where you just came from, which never ceases to be annoying. When I made it through, though, I found a conclusion to the story that left me with far more questions than answers as I watched the end credits roll, and I have to admit with some disappointment that I didn’t immediately feel compelled to gather around the nearest water cooler to discuss those questions with friends. It’s difficult to describe without spoiling anything, but I suppose I’d say that I didn’t find Somerville’s mystery as alluring as I’d hoped. Somerville follows its own unique path within the puzzle-adventure genre. That path isn’t always a smooth one, with camera annoyances and physics wonkiness occasionally serving as a pebble in your shoe while solving its series of pleasantly challenging puzzles, and the story is more strange for the sake of being strange than it is thought-provoking. But thanks to its strong visual storytelling techniques and the way the opening minutes inspire an irresistible desire to find out what happened to this man and whether or not he’ll ever find his family, Somerville is nevertheless a very good tour through an exceptionally bleak scenario – all of which is successfully conveyed without a single line of dialogue. "
Pentiment ,10,"It's been an age since I felt so captivated by such a simple adventure game as Pentiment. A rousing, steadily-paced detective thriller set in the Late Medieval Bavarian countryside, the storybook art style inspired by colorful manuscripts of the era is downright enthralling. While the gameplay basically consists of looking around for clues, questioning townsfolk, and trying to draw your own conclusions about the evidence you find, that minimalist approach works excellently for the rich and complex story Pentiment tells. Our inquisitive lead is Andeas Maler, initially an idealistic aspiring artist who comes to the picturesque, rustic town of Tassing to further his career in the nearby abbey's scriptorium. He quickly becomes embroiled in a macabre conspiracy that delves into the town's shrouded past, enticing you to uncover secrets many would rather keep buried. You get to define a lot of elements of Andreas' backstory, such as where and what he studied, which I really enjoyed and adds an element of replayability. Having a university degree in theology helped a lot when pesky monks and nuns tried to quote the Bible at me to get their way and I was able to do so right back. But my background choices didn't open up new paths quite as much as I would have liked, with their impact on a conversation most often boiling down to some different options for flavor text.  Thankfully, there aren't many unintuitive puzzles in the traditional adventure game sense where you have to find bits and bobs out in the world and combine them to make a key. So the challenge of each mystery is talking to the right people, convincing them to tell you what you know, checking their story against others you've heard, and perhaps most importantly, using your time wisely. When you commit to pursuing a particular lead, time will advance, and you're never given enough time to pursue them all. This added some welcome tension and forced me to make a lot of interesting decisions. I look forward to going back and finding out what I missed on future playthroughs. The town of Tassing and its surroundings are brought to life with a cohesive, beautiful, somewhat minimalist art style that takes inspiration from the very same period-accurate illustrations Andreas himself is working on. Sprawling fields, magnificent churches, and even secret crypts radiate color, life, and personality. Even the text boxes feature a variety of beautiful scripts that vary based on a person's social class, with flowing handwriting for peasants and sanctimonious blackletter script for members of the church. The sound design is excellent, as well. The ambience of the village square or the relative quiet of a monastery during prayer is subtle, but highly effective at conveying a sense of place. And I'm not normally one for the whole ASMR thing, but there's something about that noise of a pen scratching across vellum when characters are talking that gives me goosebumps. I feel like I could listen to it all day. The soundtrack, likewise, transported me to the Middle Ages with its traditional melodies and period-accurate instruments. The whole production really feels like a love letter from some serious Medieval history fans to all the like-minded players such as myself. Debating the writings of Christine de Pizan, discovering a certain character's entanglements with the Fugger Bank, or even having a ""What would Socrates do?"" option in certain dialogues might be lost on many, but they made me grin with joy. Far from a pop culture caricature, it's very clear that developer Obsidian Entertainment did a lot of research into the daily lives, theology, and sociology of the Holy Roman Empire in the 1500s. I practically gasped when I realized a folktale told by some of the townsfolk was a bastardization of a battle that took place near here during the Roman era. Every step of the way, I felt like I was geeking out about one of my special interests alongside the writers and artists. The dialogue and character writing are exceptional and effective, as well. Andreas himself is a complex character who changes significantly across the snapshots of his life we get to join him on. Pentiment's world is one of heartbreaking personal tragedy, complex moral dilemmas, harrowing secrets, and the search for a purpose, with a huge cast of memorable characters who evolve alongside the town – partly based on decisions you get to make. And none of those decisions are easy. I never hit a point where I knew exactly what had happened, who was to blame, and that they definitely deserved to be punished by the proper authorities. Often, the best you can do is to decide on what course of action is the least of several evils. I also really enjoyed how snappy and fast-paced the dialogue is. It's very easy for this type of game to be verbose and overwhelming. You only need to look to Obsidian's own <a href=""/pillars-of-eternity-2/14475/review/pillars-of-eternity-2-deadfire-review"">Pillars of Eternity</a> games for an example of how dumping way too much text on players at once can throw a wet blanket on a swashbuckling adventure. Pentiment wisely gets away from that tendency, with flavorful back-and-forths in which each character only speaks a sentence or two at a time. Journal entries about important people and world concepts are also tactfully brief. You're never expected to spend several minutes reading to understand what's going on. As an engrossing 15 to 20-hour adventure game, a chronicle of a small town and its people in turbulent times, a reverent celebration of the finer details of Late Medieval history, and a clever detective story in which straight answers are hard to come by – Pentiment is a clear champion. My gripes about it are all relatively minor, and I look forward to playing it at least once or twice more to explore roads not taken. It never suffers for its simplicity, lacking in combat or traditional puzzles, because of how effectively it tangled me up in the complexities of its gorgeously-realized world and made me want to learn all I could about its people and its past. There isn't much more to say about Pentiment, other than I can hardly recommend it highly enough. "
Sonic Frontiers ,7,"Sonic Frontiers doesn’t limit you to a small, carefully curated <i>prix fixe</i> menu of things to try. Instead, it takes the all-you-can-eat buffet approach, throwing new ideas at you from start to finish, without really seeming to care if they’re fresh and appetizing or looking wilted and limp under the heat lamp. When I jumped off the starting line of this sprint across Sonic’s first open-world game I certainly didn’t expect to play jump rope, duke it out with a giant robot, watch a dramatic origin story for an extinct race of beings, or do a heck of a lot of fishing, but Frontiers kept me guessing even late into the campaign with what it would try next. Even when some of those ideas didn’t work, I was almost always glad that Sega gave it the old college try, and as a result I rarely found myself bored. I did find myself feeling blue because of the absurd amount of pop-in that happens every time this famously fast character does his thing, but Sonic Frontiers is, for the most part, a promising first attempt at blazing a new trail for the series. While you’re working your way through Frontiers’ chain of five Starfall Islands over the course of about 20 hours total, you’ll uncover the dark and extremely predictable backstory of a long-extinct race while hanging out with Sonic-family favorites like Amy and Knuckles. You’ll also meet a strange new enemy named Sage and learn what her deal is in the most agonizingly slow way possible, since her main hobbies appear to be dodging pointed questions and speaking exclusively in vagaries.  With all of the different plot threads Frontiers juggles, they do end up feeling oddly disconnected from each other and none of them offer a ton of surprises between their ungodly number of cliches concerning the power of friendship and ancient civilizations wielding advanced technology. But they do leave room for some really good moments between the furry cast of characters – in fact, Frontiers produces some of the most in-depth characterizations of the Sonic cast we’ve ever seen in a game. One part of the campaign hones in on the brotherly rivalry between Sonic and Knuckles, while another does a great job at building Tails up as more than just Sonic’s sidekick. All of that more than sated my ravenous appetite for Sonic’s usual anime-style nonsense in between all of the fancy robot kicking and rolling around at the speed of sound. Sprinting around the sprawling open-world areas is, as you’d hope, one of the best parts of this open-world odyssey. The islands you dash about on are suitably large playgrounds for you to test the limits of your roadrunning, so long as you don’t fall into water or lava that immediately kills you. My personal favorite new trick, though, is the Cyloop – it lets you draw a circle while blazing a trail to create a tornado of death that impacts everything caught within it. This ability can be used and abused to do damage in combat, solve puzzles, and even farm rings since it generates a few every time. Plus, literally running circles around your enemies is just an incredibly Sonic thing to do, which is why I practically never stopped doing it throughout my playthrough. And since it lets you turn running into a deadly weapon, it makes speeding around the map all the more entertaining. The only thing that’s a little disappointing about whizzing around is that, unless you’re getting the speed boost that comes with being maxed out of rings, you don’t run quite as fast as you might hope. That can be improved a fair bit by leveling up your speed stat over the course of the campaign, but I still would have preferred the default starting speed be a little more Roadrunner and a little less hungover hedgehog. What becomes clear after a few laps around the first island is that Sonic Frontiers is an action-adventure game that joins a growing pack of old-school series looking to reimagine themselves as open-world sandboxes – and in this particular case it mostly works out. Just like <a href=""/pokemon-legends-arceus/53345/review/pokemon-legends-arceus-review"">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> and <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</a> before it, Frontiers keeps a lot of what makes the Sonic series beloved and unique (including some fun homages) but also throws in big areas to explore and fills them with a wild assortment of side distractions and mostly interesting new ideas. Not all of those activities are created equal, but it works overall just because of the sheer variety. One moment you’re juggling robots like you’re playing Baby’s First <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/06/devil-may-cry-5-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Devil May Cry</a>, the next you’re trying to beat a time trial in a 2D platforming stage, and a minute after that you’re playing a game of pinball inside of an active volcano. You’ll grind some truly epic rails, solve extremely simple puzzles, do some puzzle-platforming, and of course, catch some fish – because if you can’t fish, does it even count as an open-world game? There were moments where I saw glimpses of genius in this bizarre hodgepodge of activities. Sections called Cyber Space levels smartly break up the open world by teleporting you into bite-sized, traditionally linear Sonic levels where you’re racing the clock and collecting rings as you make a mad dash for the goal line. On the other hand, one of the big things Frontiers tries that doesn’t work well is combat. You’re just mashing buttons to pull off simple combos and knock the snot out of faceless robotic enemies. I appreciated the occasional break from platforming, but since it never proves to be a challenge and throws you into almost identical fights again and again, I soon came to resent being yanked out of my lightning-speed racing just to smack down another bunch of dumb toaster-looking fools. It’s especially annoying when it comes to the minibosses roaming the open world, who often dragged me into unskippable fight sequences that weren’t particularly challenging or interesting, especially when I ran into them multiple times. The groan of irritation at the prospect of repeating the same encounter a third or fourth time was impossible to contain. The larger goal of each zone is to collect Chaos Emeralds to power you up for a big, over-the-top boss fight, but it’s not as straightforward as it sounds. In order to find all those delicious gems you’ll have to first collect portal gears out in the world, use those gears to open portals that lead to Cyber Space levels where you can collect vault keys, then finally use those vault keys to unlock the emeralds. If that sounds at all confusing to you, it’s because it definitely can be – but by the time I completed my first island or two, I felt completely comfortable with all the different weird currencies and collectibles on my checklist. The big boss fights at the end of each island fare a bit better than the regular combat too, especially when you go full Sonic Saiyan and take on a giant, evil robot. Sometimes they’re a little awkward because of repeated animations and weird camera issues where the boss boops you outside of the arena and knocks you into a frustrating viewing angle, but flying around as an invincible rodent god and pulling off sweet butt-kicking moves makes collecting all those Chaos Emeralds worth the effort. I also really enjoyed how the perspective will automatically shift between 2D and 3D when you’re out in the open world, depending on the activity you’re engaging with. If I was grinding a rail and entered an area that required platforming, it would switch me to a 2D perspective so I could zip around like it was 1991, but when I got into a fight a moment later it would switch back to three dimensions so I could run literal circles around the enemy. The only issue is that occasionally I’d accidentally step on a spring or a rail while running around the island and find myself trapped in 2D, which was sometimes hard to get out of. It’s a bit like stubbing your toe on a board game, then having to complete a full playthrough of Chutes and Ladders before getting to go back about your business. There are other things Frontiers has you do, like solving very easy puzzles that range from mildly amusing minigames to completely braindead chores, or dipping your toes into RPG mechanics by gathering collectibles to raise your stats. These aren’t terrible additions, but they also don’t feel like they’re fully fleshed out. The upgrades in particular are a bit odd since they do things like let you carry more rings or increase your attack and defense stats by such minor amounts that they barely have an impact on gameplay. It’s almost like the developers shrugged and said “Sure, why not?” and threw a half-baked first draft of every idea they could come up with into the mix just for the heck of it. It’s also kind of insane how much progression can be earned through the fishing minigame, especially since it’s only mildly amusing for a few minutes before it starts feeling like an errand. But I can’t argue that it’s not worth my while; without even trying I quickly found it could be farmed for an enormous amount of resources that are much more difficult to acquire out in the open world. On one island, I fished with my boy Big the Cat for half an hour and gained so many portal gears, vault keys, and memory tokens that I could have chosen to bypass an enormous chunk of platforming, exploration, and combat. I was also able to level up my character over 60 times in a matter of minutes using this method, which just felt… wrong. It would be one thing if Sonic had a canonical love of seafood or something, but this is ridiculous. The biggest shortcoming with this new open-world design, though, has nothing to do with the buffet of mostly amusing activities – it’s simply that Frontiers is not at all able to keep up with Sonic’s godlike speed on a technical level. My immersion was broken about every five seconds when large objects, like a section of a floating loop-de-loop or a huge tree, popped into view right in front of me. Granted, that’s sometimes hilarious but it’s always jarring and just plain ugly. Most of the time it’s a railing or platform that blips into existence a couple feet away from you, but sometimes it’s entire areas of the world. For all of its amazing quick-loading capabilities, the PS5 just couldn’t seem to handle how hilariously fast Frontiers let me go. Whether I was playing in the 4K resolution mode at 30fps or the much more desirable 60fps mode (seriously, what are we even doing here playing a game this fast at any less?), the pop-in was always an issue. In one case I even ran so fast the ground hadn’t loaded yet and I fell through the map. It’s not a unique problem for an open-world game to have, but Frontiers’ inability to load in a timely manner is so common that it just makes everything feel flimsy and unpolished. Sonic Frontiers is a delightfully weird and experimental evolution of the Sonic games so many of us grew up with. Its series of open-world islands are filled with so much variety and pieces of Sonic history, from classic platforming stages to silly minigames, that they’re enjoyable to explore even when awful graphical pop-in is a constant hedgehog spine in your side. Some of the new stuff Frontiers tries out, like the smart toggling between 2D and 3D perspectives out in the open world or the Cyber Space levels, are fantastic ways to pack as much Sonic goodness as possible into one package, while others – especially combat – are uninteresting experiments gone wrong. Still, I largely enjoyed my time running around in Frontiers, making it feel like a very promising first attempt at what could be a bright new era for Sonic and friends. "
Marvel Snap ,8,"Want to have the Guardians of the Galaxy in the palm of your hand, leaping into play, guns blazing, and even fighting alongside Yondu once more? How about putting together your ultimate Avengers crew and doing battle across Stark Tower, Central Park and the Daily Bugle? These are the kinds of dream teams and fantastical scenarios that Marvel Snap allows, and its excellent use of the Marvel licence is packed into a punchy portable card game where matches are short, the gameplay is easy to grok and you’re encouraged to check in every day. Spoiling the fanfest a little, however, is the actual process of building out your card collection, which I’ve found to be a long grind that eventually loses its early momentum. Marvel Snap is wonderfully streamlined: your deck consists of only 12 cards - no duplicates - and games last for six rounds. The board has three locations to contest, but the locations that appear are random and pulled from a large pool, with one revealed each turn over the first three rounds. Players queue up their actions simultaneously each round, deciding how to spend their available energy (which increases as a match progresses) to play cards to the locations of their choice. Once both players have ended their turn, the cards are revealed one at a time, triggering their effects. The end goal is to have more power than your opponent in two of three locations, so there’s an impressive amount of strategy in choosing where to play your cards, not to mention how to take advantage of favourable locations and mitigate difficult ones.  Because each round happens simultaneously, Marvel Snap is a bit like a series of rock, paper, scissors encounters where you’re trying to anticipate what your opponent is likely to do. On top of this, at any point you can choose to “snap” to double the stakes of that match from the next round onwards, and your opponent can snap back at any point to double them again. The stakes themselves are cubes that raise or lower your ranking - so by the end of a game in which no one snaps, the winner gets two cubes, whereas if both players snap, eight cubes are up for grabs. And if your opponent snaps and you feel that winning is incredibly unlikely, you can retreat to lose fewer than you would by playing out a doomed match. Knowing when to snap, when to go all-in and when to retreat is critical in making progress on the ranked ladder (the only mode currently available) and goes hand in hand with a robust understanding of the meta. And for a game where each individual match takes around three minutes, there are a lot of decisions that have to be made. Each of the half-decent decks I’ve played so far in Marvel Snap have had a lot of non-obvious interactions or strategies to learn, all of which make them satisfying to play optimally. And of course, so much of what you do is based on what your opponent is doing: how they’re utilising the locations and what lines of play they’re likely to take based on what you know about their strategy and win condition. <i>So many</i> games in Marvel Snap come down to the final round, with a win on the table if you can correctly anticipate your opponent’s play. It really can be incredibly engrossing, and like all CCGs, the better you understand all of your options, the more you’ll get out of it. Marvel Snap has a diverse range of deck archetypes, supported by a host of interesting mechanics and keywords. There are decks built around discarding from your hand, having a large hand size, utilising ongoing effects, destroying your own cards, moving cards between locations, cheating big minions out, locking down locations, playing cards with no abilities, repeating “on reveal” triggers, and so on. The card pool has a little too much disruption for my tastes, which means that there are a number of decks out there that look to shut you out of any attempt to execute your gameplan; locking off locations and/or filling your locations with worthless cards. Not exactly fun. Mind you, the locations themselves often do a pretty good job of locking you out on their own, and the whole concept of having three random gameplay modifiers each match is very much a mixed blessing. Yes, it means that every game is different and you need to think on your feet - but it also means that there will be combinations of locations so antithetical to your strategy that the best play is to retreat while you’re only losing a single cube. The ability to retreat really is the only reason Marvel Snap is able to build its gameplay around a system with such high variance and not have it ruin the entire game. Even so, you’ll still be the beneficiary of - and fall victim to - absurd high rolls that are based purely on randomised location modifiers, and that’s not really something I want in my card games. There are more than 50 locations in total, from Baxter Building and the Quantum Realm through to Wakanda, Asgard, Atlantis, Knowhere, and the X-Mansion. Marvel fans will enjoy seeing how deep the cuts go, and how the location’s ability ties into its comic book origins. Ego, for instance, is a super rare location, but when it’s revealed, Ego takes over and plays your cards for you. It’s amazing flavour, but really does turn that match into a coin flip, which - again - is not my cup of tea. Thank goodness for the option to retreat. Another important aspect of the location system is that there are regular  “hot locations” and “featured locations,” both of which mean a particular location will appear significantly more frequently in games during that period. It’s like a mini meta table flip that’s designed to send players scrambling to build decks that take advantage of that location’s ability to get an edge on the competition. It’s a clever idea in theory, but in practice I think it’s actually just unfriendly to more casual players who aren’t necessarily plugged into the ecosystem enough to know how to capitalise on it. Instead, they may just find that their favourite deck is almost worthless for 24 hours. The times when the locations really shine are when they’re less binary: when you’re able to overcome a bad location or work around significant limitations to still snag a victory, so there’s certainly some upside. They also add yet more Marvel flavour, and it’s not like this game is lacking for Marvel flavour in the first place. In fact, Marvel Snap has to be one of the best uses of the Marvel licence in video games to date. It would still be great <i>without</i> it, but the team at Second Dinner really has done a fantastic job of delivering a game that fans will truly relish. There are just so many characters in the roster already - both iconic titans and niche picks - and the primary card art for them all is uniformly excellent. The variant art also has some absolutely incredible interpretations, although I must say most of the pixel variants feel pretty flat to me. It’s also a shame that variants are treated as entirely different versions of the same card, as I’m rarely excited to unlock a variant when it means I’m not gaining access to some new character instead. Marvel Snap’s collection track, which is how you unlock new cards, is built around the art too. You’ll unlock cards as you progress along the track, which is fueled by cosmetically upgrading your cards with resources earned from playing. First they burst out of the frame, then with each additional upgrade they become more elaborate, adding an impression of depth, adding movement in the background and eventually hitting max level, “Infinite.” For me this is largely a means to an end, but the animations and art are still slick enough to still be a fun moment. Second Dinner’s designers have tried to represent each character’s comic book identity in their gameplay too, so Mystique copies an ability for you, Magneto pulls opposing cards to him, Storm floods a location and Bucky Barnes transforms into the Winter Soldier when destroyed. The animations are a joy as well - Nightcrawler BAMFs into position, Green Goblin flies over to the other side of the location he’s dropped on, Miles Morales flips acrobatically into play, Yondu whistles to slice up an opponent’s card with his arrow, and Ant Man shrinks or grows when you pick him up then returns to normal size when he lands on the board. I mentioned earlier that cards are unlocked through your collection level, but it’s worth underlining just how different this is from what’s expected of the genre. This, after all, is a collectible card game in the same broad space as Magic: The Gathering and Hearthstone… and it has no card packs. There is no way to (quickly) buy your way into a collection. Instead, you need to earn the boosters and credits that can upgrade your cards, which then gives you points that contribute to your progress along the collection track, which has a variety of rewards spaced along it. You can also skip the boosters and just spend credits on fast upgrades in the shop, but even so, there’s a limit to how often you can do this. The collection track is broken up by card pools, so for the first part of your journey in Marvel Snap, you’ll be unlocking cards in Pool 1. These are foundational cards and, regardless of the order in which you unlock them, you’ll be able to cobble together a reasonable enough starter deck. Crucially, while you’re in Pool 1 you’ll face off against players at a similar position on the collection track, so their card collection will be roughly the same size as yours. This makes the early game experience really friendly, as you’re playing against people (or bots if there’s no one to match up against) who are also finding their feet and getting a feel for how to build decks. This eventually extends into Pool 2, which is a relatively small collection of cards that cater to narrower game plans. Getting through the first two pools doesn’t take all that long, and everyone who reaches that point will have the exact same collection of 97 cards; the same foundation to work from. Marvel Snap up until this point is like frolicking in shallow, balmy waters; splashing about amongst itsy bitsy waves under an azure sky. It’s when you dive into Pool 3 that you realise just how vast, and at times unforgiving, the ocean that stretches all the way to the horizon can be. Pool 3 has another 75 cards (as of this review), but no definitive end point in the collection track, and that’s because the “mystery card” unlocks that guaranteed cards in pools 1 and 2 are replaced by “collector’s caches” and then “collector’s reserves,” both of which only have a percentage chance to unlock a new card. Just like the ocean, the post-Pool 2 collection track feels like it goes forever. In reality, you should have a complete collection by the time you reach a collection level of 3000-3500 (after starting from just under 500), and that’s going to take some serious time. I’m not even close. There’s nothing wrong with long term progression in games per se, but this feels agonisingly slow, and it’s where the randomness of the system really starts to bite. It’s pure luck whether you’ll open the key cards you need to build viable Pool 3 meta decks, and given the Pool 3 meta game is largely built around high synergy combo decks, if you’re missing a crucial part of a combo, the deck’s not going to function. If you don’t get useful cards as you increase your collection level, you’ll be stuck playing (mostly) Pool 2 strategies against players who may have far more potent collections. And regardless of how lucky you are, while you’re inching your way along the collection track, the new deck opportunities feel few and far between. It’s a shame, because in Marvel Snap’s early going, I was unlocking new cards at a steady rate and regularly making changes to my decks to test things out. Later on, when the meta should theoretically be extremely varied because everyone has different collections, it actually feels like the best strategy is to stick with a strong Pool 2 deck and only switch it out when you get enough Pool 3 cards to build one of the strong combo decks. The shared early game collection actually becomes a limiting factor. The card acquisition side of things is set to be addressed through “Collector’s Tokens” in an as-yet-undated update, and these will be earnt through the collection track and can then be spent to unlock a specific card from an ever-changing randomised selection in the shop. You won’t be able to simply craft the single card you want, but this will give players some actual agency in building their collection. It can’t come fast enough. That, mind you, will be one more currency in a game already clogged with them. Credits, gold, season pass points and boosters all interact and overlap in different ways, and while the feeling of overall collection progression slows right down, you are at least always earning currencies, thanks to the six daily missions (or more, if you spend gold), as well as the season missions, both of which contribute to your season pass progress, which in turn unlocks more credits, gold and boosters. There isn’t a great deal of incentive to spend money in Marvel Snap beyond the paid track of the season pass, which offers <i>acceptable</i> rewards if you’re intending on playing enough to complete it. Spending money on gold, meanwhile, offers very little prospective value given how expensive it is to turn it into credits, new daily missions or card variants, the last of which are just absurdly expensive. All told, Marvel Snap offers a very different journey to other card games. It’s a slow and steady path that rewards you for dipping in and playing a modest amount each day. There’s no way to effectively pay for power, which means there’s no temptation to drop a hundred bucks or more to quickly get the cards you want, the way there is whenever Hearthstone or Magic releases a new set. And as someone who plays both those games, those costs can really add up. Is this system better? It depends on what kind of player you are, and whether you’re prepared to stick with Pool 2 decks (which, admittedly, do remain pretty effective) while you grind your way through Pool 3. One last thing to address is that, as of this review going live, Marvel Snap only has one option for playing games: ranked. While your ranking really only represents bragging rights given matchmaking appears to be based more on how high your collection level is, there’s still no doubt that the option to play against friends would be a huge boon, as would an unranked mode where I could feel free to experiment with no stakes, and where games would always go the distance. Both these modes are on Second Dinner’s roadmap and I think they’ll help present Marvel Snap’s personality-packed gameplay in an even more appropriate light. Marvel Snap upends the collectible card game genre with some truly fresh ideas, impressive strategic depth, wonderfully slick presentation, and a fantastic use of the Marvel licence. Not everything it attempts is an outright win, however. Its high variance gameplay can be frustrating, but is mitigated by the short games and ability to retreat mid-match, while the collection system represents a bold move away from the norm of buying into a collection, but ultimately feels slow and unsatisfying beyond a certain point. Even so, Marvel Snap deserves a place in the pocket of card game players and Marvel fans alike. "
God of War Ragnarok ,10,"How do you follow up on one of the greatest video games of all time? Sony Santa Monica finds itself in a situation not dissimilar to when Francis Ford Coppola created the sequel to his mob movie masterpiece, The Godfather. Like part two of the Corleone story, God of War Ragnarok puts a fierce, younger member of the family directly under the microscope. In doing so it manages to reach the heights of its predecessor and, in some ways, even tower above it. The writing, performances, and music are each exceptional, bringing this expansive Norse tapestry to life – but even as it holds your heart in one hand with its elegantly told story it’s crunching bones in the other with fantastically ferocious combat. It all binds together to forge a monumental action epic that adds yet another impressive landmark to the video game landscape. Keeping things broad and spoiler-free, Kratos' story picks up a few years after the final revelations of 2018's God of War – this is absolutely not one of those sequels where everything will make sense without playing the first game, or at the very least watching the included story recap (which is probably too brief to serve as anything but a jolt to the memory). The apocalyptic Ragnarok is coming, and its events circle around his son Atreus like one of Odin's ravens. Fimbulwinter – a time of unrest that presages Ragnarok – has very much come and, during the intervening years, Atreus has been growing stronger, learning about his Giant name ""Loki"", and trying to convince his father to trust him. There are touching callbacks to the hunting scene from the 2018 God of War as Kratos proudly watches Atreus prove that he’s no longer a child. But it’s no slow introduction: Ragnarok wastes no time in stepping into the action and, after a breakneck opening battle, the first step of this new journey is to leave the frozen realm of Midgard and find a missing Norse god in the broader and varied universe.  It may not be as tightly told a story as 2018's, but Ragnarok has much grander designs. This is a sprawling epic that always keeps things on the move without ever becoming disorientating, gluing me to the edge of my seat as it repeatedly toyed with expectations. It's an ambition regularly met by stunning execution, with a momentum that never slips as you hurtle towards its bombastic ending. This journey took me just over 28 hours with a few fair side quests completed along the way, but with plenty still left to do afterward. Prophecy and sacrifice swirl at the story’s centre as it repeatedly prods at the concept of destiny and whether blood runs thicker than the ink that pens it. It doesn’t merely offer up surface-level readings of these themes; instead, each character and their motives are given the respect they deserve by delving in deep. It’s a truly special and fittingly grand conclusion of Kratos’ Norse saga, as well as providing resolution to some of his more troubled Greek memories. There are twists and turns aplenty, with fakeouts and misdirection woven into the story’s fabric as it darts between loud spectacle and tender conversation. Characters old and new play their own crucial parts, including fresh characterisations of Norse behemoths like Thor and Odin, with a line of dialogue rarely wasted between them. These are truly unique depictions, and it's a credit to Sony Santa Monica and the actors playing each that I wasn’t reminded once of their MCU equivalents. Despite being laden with myth and melodrama, there's still plenty of time for welcome pockets of self-aware silliness that almost always elicit a laugh, whether that be another bizarre dwarven contraption or the simple thrill of Kratos eating a sausage. When not eating dinner, Kratos’ thunderous voice actor Christopher Judge frequently engages in smartly realised dialogue with his equally impressive castmates. Make no mistake, though: this is firmly Judge's court, and one he frequently dominates. Kratos' traumatic personal history is reflected in everything from his mournful tone of voice to his appearance - his Icarus wings are long-since clipped, but his complexion is still pale like a square of wall where a family portrait used to hang. Death weighs heavy in the winds that guide him on every journey he takes, whether delivering it himself or searching for some closure. The everlasting cycle of violence between parents and their children has long been a theme ever since the original God of War trilogy, although one that was only truly emphasised in 2018’s revival. Now it’s an inescapable fixture of Ragnarok; an exploration of the rawest and most human of emotions, and what happens when they are channeled through superhuman vessels. Pain leads to anger, anger leads to hate – this is the genesis of the stalking threat embodied by the incomparable force that is a grieving mother. Portrayed incredibly with a newfound fury by Danielle Bisutti, Freya is a striking presence to be reckoned with in the sequel and casts a much darker shadow this time around. No longer just a helpful witch in the woods, she’s given a whole new spectrum of emotional depth to play in, and Ragnarok is all the better for it. Each character is given their own moments to shine throughout; Sunny Suljic fires back regularly with the sharp, teenage tongue of a brasher, more confident Atreus, and Alastair Duncan’s severed head accessory Mimir continues to provide levity and exposition in abundance. Various newcomers to the vastly expanded cast also deliver fantastic performances, with a particular standout being Laya DeLeon Hayes, radiating infectious energy from the mysterious Angrboda. Ben Prendergast brings warmth to the nuanced Týr – he's charmingly plucky as the Norse God of War. The foul-mouthed Brok and skittish Sindri continue to bring their unique brand of dwarven charm while granting you those all-important upgrades. They often provide pockets of humour, as well as a lot of genuinely helpful info along the way as they play a much more central role in the story this time around. Also returning is composer Bear McCreary, whose score – like the dwarven smith brothers – goes hammer and tongs from the first moment to the last. There's some truly beautiful music to be heard along the journey, as well as explosions of raw orchestral power during intense fight scenes. The artistry bursting from every seam is astonishing – even when running in the high frame-rate favouring Performance mode – with excellent costume and world design on show. Ragnarok is incredibly well polished, with little details from the etchings on a dagger to the clunk of a cupboard door closing shown love. It’s expertly animated, with saliva-sputtering grimaces launching towards the lens during the heat of battle, and hair flowing realistically on Kratos’ less-follically challenged enemies. Layered writing, impeccable acting, and stunning set design are all crucial aspects in driving God of War’s filmic aspirations home, but they’re also never let down by the rock-solid technical craftsmanship at work. The one continuous camera shot style of 2018's reboot returns, snaking through the entirety of Ragnarok as if mimicking the world serpent Jörmungandr himself. The technique may have lost a little of its initial wow factor four years on, but it's still a remarkably impressive achievement that has several new tricks to show off, and only adds to Ragnarok's cinematic nature. God of War’s combat has always been the flashy attraction that draws a crowd in to be wowed by its story, however, and Ragnarok continues that tradition. It may seem familiar at first – and indeed some things remain the same – but it isn't afraid to play with expectations and throw a curveball your way. Kratos’ blades whip around in every direction, delivering a clanking firey pain to any face they meet. Heavy cleaves of his axe crunch into enemies, making them fold like bloodied origami. And yes, that axe still slices through the air, meatily lodging itself into anything unfortunate enough to be in its path, before being recalled to your palm with a hearty kick from the DualSense controller’s haptics in what remains one of the most satisfying button presses ever assigned to a controller. It's all unapologetically fast, and undeniably glorious – harking back to the brand of frantic action in which the series was originally rooted. There’s a fair helping of excessive violence on show, with Kratos willfully impaling and ripping apart any enemy put in front of him. Arenas are often tight spaces full of threats, and though you aren’t going to see the return of dozens of enemies on screen at once that spawn in wave after wave, that doesn’t mean there aren’t some aspects of those older games shining through. But even with that slight shift to old-school action, Ragnarok’s eyes are still drawn more to the shimmer of Nathan Drake's gold rather than Bayonetta's platinum. Cinematic spectacle takes precedence over the chaotic, bordering-on cartoonish action of old. The axe feels largely similar to how you remember (and that’s no bad thing) with its dynamic mix of heavy attacks and ranged power, but how you wield the blades is noticeably different. There's a greater emphasis on using them to hook enemies and maneuver them around the arena – whether that be dragging them in towards you or juggling them in the air like the hottest of potatoes. They're much closer to how they felt in the original games; a nostalgic move set with a brilliant modern edge. The action feels and looks outstanding and there are no caveats or exceptions when I say that Ragnarok is only an improvement over God of War’s already ferocious combat. Both weapons have new tricks to show off, too: you can “Frost Awaken” the axe by holding in the triangle button to power up your next attack, or mash the same button while the blades are equipped to ignite them. Locking down an enemy by freezing them with the axe before switching to the blades to unleash pain on their friends is an endless source of enjoyment. Even the shield is now more of an offensive tool, and different types can be bought and crafted to fit your playstyle. A sturdier one can soak up heavier hits, while a high-risk/reward version boosts your parry's effectiveness. Parrying has a delicious weightiness to it, and when you nail the timing, it still feels fantastic after the thousandth deflect. Trust me when I say that's a skill you'll want to perfect before taking on some of Ragnarok's toughest fights, as well. Runic abilities (special cooldown attacks assigned in your inventory) also return and, while there isn’t the same abundance of choice this time around, each is devastatingly effective. For example, Hades Retribution – a fiery stab that lodges a bomb into the ribcage of an enemy – is particularly fun to put into action. Brutal finishers on stunned enemies are another enjoyable throwback to the God of War of old. Heads are dismembered, waists are left standing and spouting blood, and torsos are carved in two. There's noticeably a good amount of variety in the randomly chosen, weapon-specific animations, too, so you won't get bored of seeing that one head stomp execution move from 2018 over and over again. My favourite has to be the simple pleasure of seeing the shock on a soldier’s face as their arms are hacked off one by one. Beautiful. Most importantly, all of these additions give an extra tactical edge as you mix up the cadence of your strikes and control each fight. Kratos is a little lighter on his feet this time around, with a bit less of a thumping clomp to his sprint. Movement is further emphasised by the way you can now grapple up from a distance using the blades, and launch across gaps to dive into combat. Taller arena design literally adds extra layers to battles, allowing you to leap from a ledge to deliver death from above. Combat sequences can feel akin to Doom kill boxes as you dash and swing around elevated platforms toward your next victim in performances of acrobatic bloodshed – juggling cooldowns, Atreus’ arrows, and your rage meter to efficiently and spectacularly destroy everyone sent to stop you. You're required to think on your feet much more and take into account a vastly increased variety of enemy attacks and status effects such as burn, frost, poison, and many more that affect both you and your attackers. Each fight feels like a real occasion as you slalom your way through ranged, parryable, and unblockable attacks in order to sneak in a hit or two. Enemies can now perform powerful-but-interruptible attacks signified by a blue ring above their head in addition to their regular skills. A double tap of the shield will sort these out, but get your timing wrong and you're in line for some considerable pain. Combat really develops over time too, as small wrinkles and bigger game-changers are introduced throughout. Environmental strikes – such as ripping a jagged tree from the ground before swinging it like an oversized baseball bat – are often available to introduce to an unfortunate soul’s face. There are plenty of other big additions to combat that I won’t divulge so as not to ruin the sensation of discovering them yourself, but Ragnarok includes some of the most eye-catchingly colourful magic attacks I’ve ever seen in a game, beautifully destructive summon abilities, and much, much more. All are further examples of Sony Santa Monica's seemingly endless pool of creativity. Ragnarok has myriad more tools in its bag than God of War 2018 ever did, and is all the more enthralling for it. It all feels exceptional when in full flow, often mesmerising with its top-tier action drenched in rhythmic brutality, and is quite simply the best combat I can remember playing in a game. And that just goes for the <i>regular </i>fights. Boss battles are of both a higher quantity and quality, including one encounter that makes the opening Stranger fight from 2018 look like a playground scuffle. There are definitely some of those huge boss fights that were so much more prevalent in the original trilogy this time around, with creatures regularly of a bigger scale than we saw four years ago. A lot of these one-on-one encounters are a true test of your capabilities as well, and even when playing on the Give Me Balance (medium) difficulty setting I’ve found myself needing resurrection stones far more than I did in the previous game. It’s not just the story bosses, either – I’ve fought massive alligator bastards called Dreki on more than one occasion, which are a real event to fight and more of a challenge than 2018’s trolls ever posed. It's great to see sprinklings of that old-school monster mayhem thrown into the mix, which manages to successfully offset some of the more serious stretches of the story. Puzzles offer much of what you'd expect – lodging the axe into objects to keep them from moving or freezing them to redirect water flows, burning vines to get elevators working, etc. Smart new puzzle ideas are consistently introduced, though, and build in complexity throughout as more abilities are added to your arsenal. They’re often fun and never in danger of slowing your progress to the detriment of the plot, but even so, Atreus or Mimir can come in with a hint far too early and sometimes rob you of that satisfying ""aha!"" moment. It's a very rare annoyance in a world where normally every last word is a joy to listen to.  Armor customisation has been streamlined, resulting in the removal of the slotting system for a more straightforward upgrading mechanic. Enchantments are now placed inside a separate amulet rather than spread over various pieces of gear. This division makes seeing what you have equipped easier and means you aren't lost delving into too many menus within menus. This also means you can upgrade a piece of armour and take it with you through your journey if your playstyle happens to perfectly click with a certain set (or if you just love how it looks). I found myself changing up my builds regularly throughout, however, as I kept wanting to experiment with all Ragnarok has to offer. The same goes for weaponry, which can be upgraded, as well as fitted with attachments such as individually named hilts and handles, each with its own perks and bonuses. Who wouldn’t want to play with the Stonecutter’s Knob, after all? Further experimentation is encouraged by the new skill token system, which allows you to add damage, stun, elemental, and other boosts to any unlocked ability. It really does feel more like you're being encouraged to build <i>your </i>Kratos this time around, rather than playing with a pre-designed action figure straight out of the box. It’s not stingy on the availability of resources needed to craft gear, further prompting you to inject your personality into a build. It’s an accessible level of RPG tinkering without ever becoming overwhelming. Realms old and new are regularly a sight to behold – many looking torn from the pages of fairy tales, stocked with oversized flora and fauna. There's an extra effort to delve deeper into the mythology this time around and, as someone who's a fan of the Nordic source material, it's a real pleasure to see all of the different interpretations of creatures, people, and places they inhabit brought to life in all manner of delightfully weird ways. The dwarven city of Nidavellir is a welcome rural change of scenery, with its many homes and tunnels that Kratos must amusingly crawl around in. It's at the centre of the rocky realm of Svartalfheim, where waterways weave through islets littered with bubbling geysers. There’s a real sense that the realm was ripped right out of the Old Norse Poetic Edda’s home of Iceland. Those geysers are also key to solving many of the puzzles in the region as you freeze them to create stepping stones and manipulate machinery – quirks like this help in making each place feel unique. Similarly, fun new ideas are introduced in the returning Alfheim, such as reflective crystals that you can ricochet your axe off of to open doors or even use to blindside unwitting opponents in combat. It's a further example of not only each realm looking distinct, but also feeling distinct to play in from one another. Every location almost feels like a puzzle box that you’re gradually unlocking through a combination of brain and brawn as you make your way through it. There's also plenty to discover, with some realms surprising in their vastness. Exploration is encouraged via boat on the Dwarven seas, or via dog sled across Elven deserts. Once again, Metroidvania elements encourage you to revisit blocked paths at a later date once you own the skill required. These new worlds bring with them dangerous new threats. If there were any faults to be found in 2018's revival, then modest enemy variety may well have been one of them. However, there is no such issue in Ragnarok, with its bestiary vastly expanded to accommodate all sizes and shapes of creatures. Familiar foes such as draugr and elves have made their way across, but this time they're joined by Grims which, you guessed it, are pretty grim scuttling toad people, and a personal favourite, the Einherjar; Aesir warriors who harness the power of the Bifrost that makes a section of your health bar glow before removing that chunk on the next hit. Each forms a part of a whole – there’s an engaging but never unfair difficulty curve throughout as you’re met with progressively greater threats. Side missions are sometimes spectacles in their own right. Standout Favours involve helping giant creatures in distress and adventures full of personal revelations through the lush jungles of Vanaheim. They are a great source of character development as you learn more about your friends and companions by helping them right past wrongs. Some side quests do just present a pure gameplay challenge over extra stories, however, such as hunting down powerful legendary enemies dotted across the realms of Yggdrasil’s roots. There is no shortage of genuinely tough side boss encounters, either. While I was perhaps taking them on too early out of eagerness, they were a great test of skill nonetheless. Chipping away at larger health bars is a really satisfying challenge and remarkably well-balanced against the standard quick-kill nature of the majority of Ragnarok’s fights. It’s yet another testament to the masterful combat design on display. And yes, there are some absolutely tough-as-nails, endgame-level challenges to rival the Valkyries of 2018, but I'm going to let you find out what those are for yourself. There's a substantial slew of collectibles to clean up as well with Odin's Ravens, puzzle chests, artifacts, and much more to find in every corner. There's a ton to be done after the main story has been brought to a close, all of it incredibly moreish and fun to complete. Regardless of their nature, all of the optional content is joyously snackable. They not only flesh out the world of Ragnarok and riff smartly on the mythology, but also serve as valuable father-and-son time, with the end of the world creeping ever closer. Ragnarok never once rests on its laurels, throwing new ways to play at you until the very end. Despite having a seemingly endless amount to praise here, I really have barely scratched the surface of what God of War Ragnarok has to offer – I’m deliberately omitting dozens of secrets and surprises. I wouldn't dare spoil what's to come for anyone booting it up for the first time, but rest assured, there are both huge story moments and fresh gameplay additions that live up to and often surpass expectations. Taken all together, much like The Godfather Part 2, God of War Ragnarok delivers not only a chapter that reaches the lofty heights of its predecessor but leaves it impossible to imagine the series without it. An enthralling spectacle to behold and an even more exciting one to take the reins of, God of War Ragnarok melds action and adventure together to create a new, unforgettable Norse saga. Impeccable writing, pitch-perfect performances, knockout action – it’s a complete work of art from top to bottom. Reflecting its core themes, it's everything a sequel should be: respectful of its legendary lineage, but not afraid to take it to exciting new places. God of War Ragnarok is an almighty achievement and creates a new high that makes many of its peers look positively mortal by comparison. "
Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord ,8,"The claustrophobic press of frenzied melee, whistling of missiles, and thunderous charge of cavalry are often represented in games, but rarely so personally as in the Mount &amp; Blade series. It’s not often I get the feeling I’m experiencing what must’ve been the needs of a commander at eye-level on the field trying to maneuver his forces, or being forced to desperately scramble among bodies for a quiver of arrows or fresh shield. This is the appeal of Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord, and it outweighs all of the holes, bugs, and underwhelming strategy and roleplaying mechanics you have to wade through to get here. When you reach the battlefield, this low-fantasy medieval simulation is unmatched. Bannerlord drops you into the shoes of a capable, temporarily impoverished wannabe in a sandbox world based on late antiquity, complete with a fragmenting Roman Empire stand-in. It's an engaging scenario for its variety of combatants, mercenary bands, and warring societies, each with a unique historically-based way of fighting. In contrast, Bannerlord's main story is very thin, but revolves around finding the remnants of an ancient and symbolic banner – then deciding whether to use it to finish off the empire or take the banner to reunite its fragmented territories.  It qualifies as a sandbox because how you rise to power is largely up to you, whether on a trade fortune, becoming a famous mercenary, or working from inside one of the eight kingdoms. From there it's all about conquest in the name of your chosen nation – or throw that out the window and start a faction of your own. That said, the actual kingdom-management strategy is weak due to shallow mechanics and lackluster AI – it's really just an excuse to raise big armies and smash them together. You do that via maneuvering in an overworld strategic layer before dropping into hybrid action real-time strategy battles where you directly control only yourself, but can issue commands to your AI-driven troops. That description paints a picture of a living, vibrant world, where kingdoms and nobles have grand goals and overarching relationships. Sadly, that's not the case. Bannerlord's world is busy enough, with caravans of traders, robber bands, parties of warriors, and peasants scurrying about between settlements like ants, but all that really only exists so you have something of your enemy's to raid, pillage, loot, and burn. Even the diverse settlement characters and noble clans are just an empty relationship bar for you to grind up for bonuses.   Much of that anemia would be a forgivable indulgence if Bannerlord wasn't so rife with simple bugs. Quests will trigger relating to a faction you're not part of. Perks from leveling up, constructing buildings, or enacting kingdom laws sometimes just… have no effect at all. Multiplayer is rife with network and server errors. Perhaps most pervasive are the graphical glitches, which are legion but mostly involve gaps in weapon models and an array of clipping that speaks to a broader lack of attention to detail. Seriously: the would-be empress Rhagaea, one of the eight most important NPCs in the world, consistently has her chin clipping out of her chainmail coif. What the hell is that? Fighting is the meat here. The massive clash of as many as a thousand soldiers on the field is unrivaled, at least at the scale and level of simulation Bannerlord attempts. Whereas the overworld map is very transparently not a simulation of a real world, the combat tries to stick to at least historically plausible outcomes, so swinging a sword often feels desperate and real. No matter how potent you are as a single combatant, a handful of opponents of decent skill can quickly overwhelm you: you are not a god of the battlefield who cuts down a dozen enemies at a stroke. You're just another person, albeit a smarter one than the AI grunts.  On that person-to-person level, Bannerlord's combat is delightful. Chaotic and confusing at first, I soon started to understand the interplay of the four attack angles, parrying, blocking, and types of weapons. Every attack has its velocity measured against the target's, subtracting or adding damage relatively, and tracking the location hit to determine how armored it is. It tracks relative weapon and shield position, allowing attacks to catch on an opponent's counterattack or nearby object. Weapon weight plays a factor, as does elevation, swing length, and even what part of your weapon hits the enemy: Hitting someone with the haft of your axe, for example, does far less damage than the head. Learning all of these little details, then tweaking the difficulty to suit yourself, is what makes Bannerlord’s combat superb. Desperately aiming your attacks, picking targets, and outfighting opponents is pulse-pounding absorption entirely different from the more furious combat of over-the-top action games. That's most on display in multiplayer, where you can test your skill against others in one-on-one duels. For some that's really the whole game, as the fighting-game-like interaction of weapon options builds depth.  Oh, and then throw your character's personal skill out the window when you get into large-scale fights against the AI or another player. Your quick blade might matter a lot in the arena, but when you're crushed into a melee among dozens of others there's no easy escape from enemy attacks, and wide sweeps of your sword are as likely to catch on an ally's spear haft as strike your opponent directly. The chaotic clash of shield walls, or the mixed scrum of a running cavalry battle, is the absolute peak of Bannerlord. Playing online, Bannerlord's Captains mode has two teams of six go up against each other, with each player in command of their own squad of soldiers. The metagame of play here is wild due to Bannerlord's robust commands and troop variety.  Organizing and commanding your soldiers is a high point. Figuring out how to use terrain, elevation, formations, and more on any of the many, quite varied battlefields is a really nice pre-battle puzzle. One hundreds-strong block of infantry is fine in an open field, but terrible for siege assault, for example. I love breaking my infantry off into a formation of pikes when I breached enemy walls, letting those long-reach weapons clear the gap while the heavily armored and shielded troops stormed the intact walls via siege towers. It takes a bit of learning, but thankfully bringing up the orders menu in combat slows time way down (not in multiplayer, of course), giving you precious moments to consider orders and placement before executing a plan. Combine all those considerations with the broad variety of troops to collect and maintain and you're all but guaranteed to find a playstyle that suits you well. A Mongol-esque horde of horse archers? A shield wall of heavy Germanic infantry? A thundering charge of knights? A hit-and-run force of light cavalry? All of those and more are viable choices in Bannerlord precisely because it tries so hard to mimic the ideas of medieval combat. Put them in the hands of other players online and you'll be cursing the guy who invented the shield wall, the crossbow, or my new nemesis: The jerk who figured out you could use a bow from horseback.  I just wish that same attention to detail was demonstrated elsewhere, specifically in the overworld aspect of the campaign. Many other parts of Bannerlord feel woefully underdeveloped, from diplomatic relations to roleplaying decisions, and much of it feels like busywork you can do that has no real impact on the outcome of a campaign. A more focused sandbox that didn't feel the need to have arbitrage-trading economics, or a system of laws and privileges for factions to vote on, would serve to highlight that delicious combat much better, rather than bury each instance of a standout cool fight under an hour of grinding to make it happen.   Much like the creepy, lifeless eyes of its many NPCs and their stiff animations, Bannerlord's world never feels alive. You can go about talking to people, fulfilling their fetch or kill quests, doing empty minigames to convince them of things, even playing Tablut against them, but it's all about finding your way into the next fight. Playing it as a trader simulation or political strategy game will be shallow and repetitive, with little reward. NPCs have no deep motivation and an extremely limited pool of awful dialogue, and even when a relationship meter says you're best friends or bitter enemies, there's no real weight behind it. For a game that's remarkably text-based, Bannerlord just doesn't have any interesting text.  In short, it's good that the combat is fun: Everything that's not a fight is ultimately just a bit of color before you get caught up in a brawl somewhere or decide to kick off a new war. In that way Bannerlord's closest comparable genre is arguably the space sim. You can do a load of different things in a big world, but that world trades detail for scale. All that everything quickly turns to a somewhat-bland nothing via repetition. And there is a lot of repetition: progressing your skills or kingdom in Bannerlord requires an interminable amount of grind, brutally forcing me to repeat the same tasks until I begged for mercy at raiding the same bandit lair maps or retaking a castle the NPCs of your clan have lost for the umpteenth time.  That’s what really hobbles the exceedingly simple strategy layer. Most of the challenge there comes from herding NPCs and running around to give in-person orders. It's so difficult to coordinate the actions of the braindead AI without gathering them into a single army that you'll likely resent any time the other lords in your faction gather one for themselves, because they'll inevitably waste it on whatever objective is closest rather than which one is more vital to your cause. There are just a hundred obvious things missing from this world, in even their simplest forms. I can't send messengers to the AI characters and factions asking for things? Did nobody in this entire world manage to invent boats? Plus, some of what's there is tedious. It's telling that a popular PC mod automates for-profit trading, while another adds copious defensive options so you don't have to spend hours picking off bandits or reclaiming the same castle twice in a single war.  Which brings us back around to combat, because it's most of the way you interact with the world. You can auto-resolve fights when two armies meet, which is nice for skipping past overwhelming stomps, but for real battles it's not worth it for two reasons: The auto-resolve will almost always get dramatically worse results than you could (which is a fairly standard consequence of taking a shortcut like this), and second, opting out of the majority of fights just makes Bannerlord a worse version of medieval strategy games like Crusader Kings or Total War.  Without rich features a sandbox quickly looks like a desert, and barren is what Bannerlord's overworld becomes after 10 or 15 hours of play. And 10 or 15 hours isn't even half of what you'll need to finish a campaign – try 40 to 70 hours. You'll still be playing long after you've seen everything there is to see, seeing it again and again with little by way of variety to distinguish one time from the next. Whether you're still having fun comes down to how richly you're roleplaying to yourself and how much you enjoy the battles.  For all that it gets wrong, however, Bannerlord does have one huge thing going for it: Play sessions can be really short. All those bite-size fights, epic battles, minigames, and quests can fit in a very satisfying hour-long sitting, something that other games of this long-term scope struggle to do. It's a paradox to say that it's a very long short game, but Bannerlord clears that game design hurdle pretty heroically. It’s a shame that Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord lets you auto-resolve its glorious action/real-time strategy combat but forces you to endure dozens of hours of laborious and repetitive activities on its dry, flavorless overworld map. If I could skip over the bugs, shallow grinds, and frustrating non-combat activities around building up your faction and quickly return to battle it'd be easier to recommend. When it comes to simulating a medieval warfare at the ground level between hundreds of soldiers down to every swing of a sword and clash of shields, this is the only game in town. "
The Valiant ,6,"One part small-scale, isometric sword-and-shield skirmishing and one part continent-spanning treasure hunt for a powerful religious artefact, The Valiant is a medieval squad-based RTS that’s as much clicking as it is conquering. If you microwaved your copies Kingdom of Heaven and Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade and made a scented candle out of the molten goop you might get a whiff of what developer Kite Games is going for here. However, while the result is a competent strategy game overall, it’s also a bit repetitive and shallow – and subsequently not quite as fun as that previous fusion sounds. An adequate way to quickly describe The Valiant might be as a 13th century Company of Heroes. A more accurate parallel, however, might be<a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/31/ancestors-legacy-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""> <u>2018’s Ancestor’s Legacy</u></a> thanks to its broadly comparable Middle Ages setting and its very similar range of unit types. They differ considerably in terms of story, though; while Ancestor’s Legacy is more overtly inspired by historical events (albeit loosely), The Valiant is a the tale of a retired crusader knight, Theoderich von Akenburg, and his search for an ancient and dangerously powerful relic – which he’s racing against an equally dangerous Templar of doom to recover. Joining Theoderich along the way is a brave band of medieval expendables, plucked from several corners of the post-classical world.  The Valiant is the kind of RTS that takes a more intimate approach to tactical, top-down combat by focussing on individually managing a handful of units rather than an enormous army. This approach brings with it a fair degree of initial accessibility, because juggling the actions of a half-dozen or so small squads is certainly a lot more straightforward than managing giant swarms of them in something like StarCraft 2. The Valiant also does quite well at pacing its 20-hour campaign to slowly and organically teach us how each of the units tick, rather than handing over the keys to the castle from the first mission. The campaign definitely gets a bit samey in stretches, with a lot of identical encounters staged one after the other, but it was engaging to be exposed to brand-new squads, like the healing War Priests, even late in the main story. Even though certain missions are built around specific units’ abilities, there’s still some inviting flexibility here in terms of how we can approach each mission – and that really opens up in the closing stages of the campaign when all the unit types are unlocked. Only a finite selection of the main heroes and the backup mercenary squads can be taken into each battle, which is a smart way to compel us to find and embrace the tactics that work for our own style instead of being tempted to simply enlist one of each and toss them all into the grinder. For instance, my playstyle is slow and methodical, and thus I found myself gravitating towards doubling down on archers whenever I could. Archers dole out piles of damage from afar but are cut down in any sort of close quarter combat, so my approach was to draw the enemy into battle with my tank-like heroes up front and then rain arrows upon them from a distance. I found cavalry handy, too, for quick hit-and-run strikes against enemy archers – but mounted units are, in turn, vulnerable to spearmen and shieldbearers. This scissors-paper-rock philosophy is obviously typical of the genre but it’s something that The Valiant not only does well, but also communicates clearly in its menu screens. However, things do become a little more cumbersome once you layer on the special abilities and various supernatural powers The Valiant’s heroes possess, or earn as they level up. The aggressive micromanagement required can get a little boring and exhausting at times – and personally I got pretty numb to all the math disguised as magic when success regularly comes down to fastidiously spamming special attacks and boosts, watching them cool down, and then spamming them again. There are some keyboard shortcuts that speed it up a fraction, but it can feel like a bit of a grind. Outside of combat, the need to backtrack considerable distances to replenish squads at camps tends to bog things down, too – and the lack of a manual save option is very annoying when you need to replay lengthy battles that could’ve easily had one or more extra checkpoints. There’s some very basic base building in The Valiant, but only in a few siege missions, and it’s limited to a trio of defensive towers and the chance to build catapults and trebuchets. These missions aren’t quite as fun as they seem, as they don’t seem totally suited to the deliberately constrained squad limit of The Valiant. That is, you need to take over resource facilities around the map in order to build a modest camp and the necessary siege engines – but you can’t really protect all your resource facilities <i>and</i> your camp with your limited squads. You have to traipse back and forth, retreating to your camp every couple of minutes as the castle sends out an attack. There’s a decent variety of locations – even if the combat is all effectively the same whether you’re fighting on snowy mountains, dense swamps, or blazing deserts – and they do look nice at a distance. Character models aren’t exactly brimming with detail when you zoom in, but to be fair they’re designed to be seen at a few millimetres tall. Some of the missions let us tackle objectives in the order we choose but outside of that The Valiant mostly channels us through a specific, linear series of encounters. There are 16 story missions, and there are additional challenges you can toggle on when redoing them, but there aren’t any I’m desperately keen to play again – especially following the infuriating final boss fight. This last clash – which inexplicably strips away every perk, buff, and weapon The Valiant spends <i>the entire campaign</i> encouraging you to select and curate – is absolutely awful and bafflingly hard. It’s deeply unsatisfying to suddenly have bog-standard enemies shrugging off blows from the trash weapons I discarded a dozen missions ago, and having all but one of the special abilities you’ve earned arbitrarily removed doesn’t just feel anticlimactic – The Valiant is outright cheating against you at this point. It’s a shame the stench of the final battle lingers like a fart in a suit of armour, because I otherwise enjoyed the story overall. There’s a fair bit of filler in the middle, and The Valiant has a habit of sidetracking Theoderich with the needs of random royals interrupting his own quest, but the writing is earnest and the voice acting is very good. The Valiant’s story campaign isn’t the only mode available – technically, there’s also PVP play for two or four players, and a cooperative PVE horde mode for three players called Last Man Standing – but it’s really the only scene at the moment. Right now the multiplayer is deader than a medieval monarch with an ambitious, knife-wielding nephew, making it all but impossible to get much out of it unless you’ve brought your own opponents. The Valiant is a serviceable, squad-based RTS that serves up some usually well-balanced sword-clanging action for its heroes and their small bands of merry men, though it wears a bit thin once it’s evident how repetitive and backtrack-heavy the battles can get. There’s a sturdy story to drive it forward, though it too is let down at the last moment by an ill-considered final battle that renders all your decision-making throughout the campaign worthless. And while The Valiant does have multiplayer, don’t count on being able to find any opponents to clash with online. "
Star Ocean: The Divine Force ,7,"Six years after <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/star-ocean-integrity-and-faithlessness-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness</a> disappointed fans of the sci-fi JRPG series like me, Star Ocean: The Divine Force feels like a long-awaited return to form in many ways. Its revamped combat is a lot of fun, breathing fresh life into a system that certainly benefits by evolving with the times a bit. Other areas do stagnate, unfortunately, like its lackluster visuals and horrid user interface. But a respectable story full of likable characters makes this a sequel I’m still very happy to have sailed through the stars of. The Divine Force tells a standalone story that isn’t directly connected to any other Star Ocean games, but it does contain quite a few references to past events and characters that were rewarding to catch as a series veteran. This particular tale follows a reasonable young space merchant with a really bad haircut named Ray, who crashlands on the underdeveloped, medieval-like planet of Aster IV. There he meets Laeticia, the prim and proper princess of the Kingdom of Aucerius, and agrees to assist her in fending off a nearby empire in return for help finding his missing crewmates. I enjoyed that the story kicks off at a smaller scale than you might expect from a spacefaring adventure, but things only grow impressively from there, as the conflicts on this backwater planet end up having astronomical consequences that go beyond the stars.  One cool twist is that you’re actually given the choice between following Ray or Laeticia as your main character, with a handful of instances where they split up and you only see what happens with the side you picked. You’ll be able to follow the overall story just fine either way, but there are some smaller moments that won’t make much sense without knowing what happened to the other party. For example, I picked Ray’s path, and at one point there was talk about an arranged marriage between two nations that I had absolutely no context for. However, had I picked Laeticia instead, I would have understood that conversation but potentially missed something else. It’s an interesting storytelling mechanic that encourages you to go back for a second playthrough of the roughly 30-40 hour campaign, though it’s not enough to make up for the lack of a New Game Plus option. I’d love to see the story events that I missed out on with Laeticia, but not being able to transfer over the levels, skills, and equipment of my party is a real disincentive. The Divine Force’s cast of characters is a lively bunch that consists of both Aster IV locals and people from off-planet. The dynamic between your main party is especially fascinating because half of them come from a civilization that hasn’t even discovered the concept of gravity yet, while the other half is casually familiar with warp drive engines that allow spaceships to travel light years. That results in plenty of entertaining and unexpected moments, like when the party is trying to find a cure for a disease that is wiping out Aster IV’s population. Ray’s robotic but surprisingly caring first commander, Elena, is able to create an antidote based on a few bird-dropping samples, but that also involves teaching Laeticia and her comrades about the concept of bacteria. You can also learn more about each character through Private Actions, which are cute cutscene moments that you trigger by talking to your party members while they are scattered around the world’s various towns. Private Actions show off a lot of a character’s personality and quirks, giving them opportunities to talk about more than just the events of the main story. In particular, I really enjoyed learning about Laeticia’s knight guardian, Albaird Bergholm, and his fondness for sweets – he loves them but keeps it a secret because he thinks it's unbecoming of a knight. The issue with Private Actions, however, is that they’re very annoying to find. Just like in past games, Private Actions are pretty well hidden and you have to go out of your way to sniff them out, with no icons or indications to tell you when a new one has popped up. I hated wasting so much time fast traveling to other towns, running around them, and talking to all of my party members in the hopes of triggering a Private Action. The conversations were generally worth having once I found them, but I wish this feature was more streamlined. It’s also disappointing that character animations and faces don’t live up to the otherwise lovely environments you find them in. Characters have this doll-like porcelain look to their expressions that always comes off a little unintentionally creepy. This stands in sharp contrast to the gorgeous 2D character art from Akira Yasuda that primarily appears in promotional materials and box art. Pretty much none of that is in the game itself, which is frankly baffling – the clean lines and sharp, realistic details within the eyes and lips are just so aesthetically pleasing, I was left wondering how the 3D models could end up looking so poor in comparison. Star Ocean’s previous battle system has received almost a complete overhaul in The Divine Force, and it’s one that’s worked out for the better. Here, it plays very similarly to the action-combat of a JRPG like the 2009’s <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/20/tales-of-graces-f-review-un-scored"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Tales of Graces</a>, which was ahead of its time with the wide variety of flashy skills at your disposal. The Divine Force lets you assign up to three combat skills to each face button in sequential order, and pressing a button three times during a fight will have you carry out all three of those moves in the order you listed them. This new system feels much more flexible and smooth, especially compared to past games –  previously you were only able to set a few skills due to the old Capacity Points system and would end up spamming the same two-to-four skills in battle as a result. But now this problem is completely gone, and the large selection of different combat abilities you can equip keeps battles from ever feeling stale. (That’s also helped by the excellent soundtrack, with the electric guitars of Ray’s battle theme making fights even more exhilarating.) But the real game changer here is the DUMA system, named after the party’s robot companion. With DUMA, the party member you are controlling will be able to rush an enemy down and close the gap between them at high speed. You can even change directions while rushing, and if you turn away from your target’s eyesight you’ll activate a Blindside – a returning feature introduced in <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/02/19/star-ocean-the-last-hope-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Star Ocean: The Last Hope</a>. Blindsides are as powerful as they are fun, momentarily paralyzing enemies and allowing your entire party to wail on them. And while DUMA adds a ton of adrenaline and momentum to combat, it can also be used defensively. For example, you can exchange your ability to rush to instead allow DUMA to reduce the amount of damage your party takes. Being able to switch between modes on the fly like this makes battles more dynamic and exciting. Not only is DUMA invaluable during fights, but it also plays a role outside of combat. You can use DUMA as a sort of jetpack to help you scale buildings in town or up mountains in the wild. You might find hidden purple gems while doing so, which are amusing collectibles to hunt down that help level up DUMA’s different abilities. This semi-open world exploration feels natural while flying around with DUMA, but the landscapes are also somewhat empty and lacking in personality. The vast environments have lots of wide open fields, but they seem large only for the sake of being large. There are no massive changes in elevation, and the fields are mostly just flat without any discernible landmarks. The environments and skyboxes can at least look beautiful, but the layouts of each area aren’t on par with what a game like the impressive <a href=""/xenoblade-chronicles-3/58576/review/xenoblade-chronicles-3-review"">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a> showed off on the Switch earlier this year. Menus aren’t pleasing to look at either. In the party member screen, you’re greeted with boring and dull black boxes. To make matters worse, whenever you hover over a character, you’re shown their mediocre 3D model instead of those lovely 2D portraits. For all of Integrity and Faithlessness’s faults, one aspect that it did well was its menu, which showed giant 2D artwork of the party members around each other, very similar to what <a href=""/tales-of-arise/49593/review/tales-of-arise-review"">Tales of Arise</a>'s menu had. It’s a shame that The Divine Force didn’t attempt to replicate that style. Perhaps surprisingly, the worst offender when it comes to menus is actually the font size. It’s honestly the smallest font that I’ve had to read in a game in recent memory, and I literally had to squint my eyes in order to legibly read subtitles, tutorial info, and skill descriptions. Most games nowadays come with an option to increase the font size, but The Divine Force doesn’t have that. I really hope Square Enix addresses this issue in a post-launch patch because it’s genuinely distracting, and not even having the most basic accommodations for accessibility is unacceptable. That said, the UI issues aren’t so bad that I can’t wait to optimize my party’s gear for the post-credits content that the Star Ocean games are known for. Each character has a specific Item Creation talent, like Ray’s natural affinity for Smithery to create weapons and Laeticia’s Compounding skills to make medicine. The process is straightforward and easy to understand – for example, combining two blueberries makes a blueberry potion – which prevents progression from feeling like a chore. It’s not crucial to make the most of this crafting during the regular campaign, but I know that I’ll have to spend time mastering the system if I want to be properly prepared for the hardest fights that The Divine Force has to offer. The Divine Force isn’t necessarily a standout in this long-running series, but it is a much more successful effort to bring Star Ocean into the modern age than its predecessor. The revamped battle mechanics do wonders for its previously limited combat system, offering more freedom and flexibility than ever before. The main cast of characters is also charming, even if the world they are exploring and the animations that accompany them are far less captivating. I wish its interface issues were less obnoxious, but even so, The Divine Force at least proves that Square Enix’s sci-fi JRPG certainly deserved another shot. "
Gotham Knights ,5,"From everything I’d seen up to this point, Gotham Knights appeared to have all the makings of the ambitious, action-packed smash hit that it was clearly intended to be. I mean, who wouldn’t want a new, co-op-centric take on Rocksteady’s spectacular <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/19/batman-arkham-knight-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Batman: Arkham games</a> that’s built for the current console generation? But then, as I played it for 30 hours, it just kept hitting me with bad news: WHAM! Underwhelming combat. POW! A weak, predictable story. BIFF! Puzzling progression design choices. THWACK! Sub-30 frame rates. I’m left wondering how it went so wrong. Some good parts manage to shine through, like the impressive open-world Gotham sandbox, but its problems never let me enjoy the moment-to-moment crime fighting nearly as much as Bat-family fans deserve. Since Gotham Knights is Batman-adjacent, we need to cover its origin story. Like Bruce Wayne it was born to a well-respected and rich family, in this case the four third-person action games in the Arkham series. That’s not to say that this is a sequel to those games – WB Games Montreal decided to splinter off into a separate version of DC comics canon – and in a lot of places it goes out of its way to chart its own vigilante-based course. But when you’re stealthily grappling from ledge to ledge, crawling through ventilation shafts, and beating up groups of criminals in a rhythmic combat system, it’s impossible not to compare it to the vastly superior Arkham games.  One key difference is that here you get to play as your choice of the four mostly lovable heroes (Nightwing, Batgirl, Red Hood, and Robin) as you zip around an open-world Gotham, delivering justice to all manner of superstitious cowards and unraveling a troubling mystery in the iconic city’s murky streets. That mystery revolves around the death of none other than the Batman himself, which serves as a solid kicking-off point for a new generation of crime fighters to take the spotlight. In the wake of the Dark Knight’s demise, Bruce Wayne’s ragtag gang of current and former sidekicks step into the fray to fill his formidable shoes, and serves as a strong premise to what ultimately turns out to be a lackluster story full of foreseeable twists and unsurprising turns. As various criminal elements rush in to fill the power vacuum left by Batman, the ancient order known as The Court of Owls supposedly becomes the biggest threat facing Gotham, even if they don’t live up to that threat in practice. I quite like The Court as an enemy within the pantheon of Batman rivals, but for a secret society that’s supposed to have pulled the strings of Gotham’s leaders for hundreds of years, it’s pretty amusing that they never really exert that power even as a group of young adults easily foil their plans with a pocketful of gadgets and a couple karate moves. I kept wishing that their far-reaching influence and resources would be wielded in a way that would give me a reason to fear them, but they couldn’t be bothered to do more than send some well-dressed goons after you and shake their fists as you infiltrated their ranks. They just never pose any kind of threat, instead serving as punching bags for you to take out your aggression on the caviar-guzzling, bow tie-wearing, Eyes Wide Shut upper class. But the story’s biggest issue is that it tries way too hard to squeeze an entire rogue’s gallery of potential suspects into its murder-mystery premise, and feels completely disorganized as a result. You spend most of the surprisingly short campaign’s eight story missions jumping from one villainous cabal to another, before arriving at a conclusion I was able to predict practically before the end of the opening credits. It’s devastating to see such an underwhelming plot unfold after the Arkham series included some of my favorite Batman stories of all time, which often left me speechless with their stirring twists and turns. Gotham Knights, by contrast, includes a masked character whose identity is immediately apparent upon first sight and whose inevitable unmasking is laughably anticlimactic. It’s followed up with an ending that’s foreshadowed so frequently and unsubtly that I involuntarily cringed when they actually went through with it. It doesn’t help that the oddly brief campaign is padded out with busywork, like repeated sections where you have to wander around Gotham interrogating a string of different criminal factions headed by everyone from Harley Quinn to Mr. Freeze to gather clues about the next story development, and side quests to unlock table stakes features like fast travel. (That one has you visiting every part of the map to stand around and scan drones for no discernable reason.) In between all those chores, you’ll also have to contend with the RPG elements that force you to grind and min-max equipment before the next story mission can be tackled. All of these things do little more than drag out a story that’s rarely worth the squeeze, and make the pacing even more of a drag than it already is. Even if you are just running around Gotham aimlessly or tackling minor crimes, though, exploring the city can at least be a highlight. It may not get a lot right, but WB Games Montréal succeeds at capturing the fantasy of exploring a crime-ridden city as a caped crusader, and I spent hours just grapple-hooking around and exploring the area. Doing so with a friend is also rewarding, especially since there are no limitations for how far you can be from one another; you can fight together or split up to search for clues to unlock the next main mission, or tackle optional quests twice as fast as you’d be able to do on your own. It’s really nice to not be tethered to another player when you join their world, especially if you’re like me and don’t enjoy playing the role of the sidekick who can’t peel off to investigate when I get easily distracted by shiny objects in the distance. It’s fortunate that each of the four protagonists are fairly likable and well-written too, and there are plenty of amusing quips to help you get through the letdown of a plot. Sure, Red Hood mostly just keeps talking about how he died that one time like the edge lord that he is, and Robin (the Tim Drake version) swings wildly between being deeply depressed by his mentor’s death and making silly jokes, but it’s still impressive that these B-listers and sidekicks manage to step up to the plate as much as they do. (They’ve all had their own stories in comics and TV shows, but few that hold a candle to Batman’s.) That said, glitches do occasionally cause otherwise-touching story moments to instantly transform into comedies, like one cutscene where Jason Todd’s hoodie drawstrings decided to defy gravity and threatened to poke his friends’ eyes out during a tense conversation. It’s also neat how well Gotham Knights’ story adapts to you playing whichever character you want. Since you can switch between any of the four protagonists in between missions, different versions of each cutscene are required, complete with character-specific dialogue depending on who you’ve selected to play as. With a few exceptions where certain scenes don’t make much sense if you played someone else in a previous mission, it’s great that the script recognizes whose butt-kicking boots I’m wearing during different moments. Really, my only major complaint with swapping characters is that each character has to unlock their abilities and be geared up individually, so the longer I played as one the less feasible it was to actually switch to someone else – I’d have to stop making progress to catch up one character and unlock all their special abilities before proceeding. What good is the ability to switch characters when doing so means going back to square one and having to grind XP and gear all over again? Look, I’m no stranger to grinding. I’m a Destiny 2 fan, after all. But what Destiny 2 has that Gotham Knights doesn’t is great combat that I come back to for the fun of it, not just the rewards. Unfortunately, combat in Gotham Knights is one of the worst parts about it – and that’s not a great thing to have to say about a game that’s virtually all about combat. It’s not the worst thing I’ve ever played but if you were hoping for a return to the smooth, incredibly fine-tuned brawls of the Arkham series, you’re in for a rude awakening when you’re smacked in the face with the simple and underwhelming substitute that sits at the center of this disappointing adventure. Playing as these heroes offers some cool playstyles and abilities with which to fight crime, and yet those options almost always take a backseat to mashing the same buttons until everything is unconscious. The oversimplification of combat is perhaps best exemplified by the complete absence of anything resembling the Arkham games’ counter system, an omission that still baffles me even after completing it. At its best, dishing out justice is merely boring as you repeat the same attacks and wait for your special ability meter to charge up and enemy health bars to whittle down (yes, they have health bars over their heads); at its worst, it’s actively frustrating as you’re hit by attacks that seem almost impossible to dodge and don’t feel like you have full control of your character. Fighting crime hasn’t felt this unsatisfying since before Arkham Asylum revolutionized it in 2009, and since you’ll spend <i>a lot</i> of time doing it, this tragic shortcoming is like a deep cut on the roof of your mouth that just refuses to go away. As I played, I kept hoping Gotham Knights would introduce more mechanics later on in the campaign and things would eventually evolve and feel better. It never did. Combat may never become interesting, but I can at least give it credit for the diversity of options available to you. Since there are four playable characters, you can opt to be a hulking, DPS-focused, gun-toting maniac with Red Hood, or a stealthy, tech-hacking egghead by playing Batgirl. Stealthing around with Robin to take out enemies quietly is a markedly different experience from playing Nightwing, who specializes in dancing around the map and buffing allies, and that means you can pick the character that best suits your playstyle and customize it to your liking. As a Robin main, I maximized stealth (partially to minimize time spent in bland combat), and leveled up my ability to apply status effects to enemies, while my co-op partner played Batgirl and transformed her into a tanky beast who could take a beating and revive herself after getting downed. Each character also has their own set of Momentum Abilities: Robin can summon nanorobots to attack his enemies and become invisible to the naked eye, while Nightwing can create bubbles of safety that heal allies and harm enemies. Unlocking these requires – you guessed it – a bit of grinding, and quadruply so because you’ve got to complete challenges with each character individually. But it’s well worth the effort to break up what’s otherwise uninspired combat – they still may not be ""good,"" but at least they're different. My love of crunching numbers and exploiting the meta within RPGs is well-known, but Gotham Knights’ equipment and leveling system is so disorganized that I found myself avoiding my menus as often as possible. As you gain XP and level up, you’ll acquire new weapons and armor, mod components, and crafting schematics to aid your power creep, but unless you’re extremely lucky or willing to grind a whole lot of repeatable crimes in Gotham’s open world, you’re unlikely to have much power over what you’re able to use or craft because drops aren’t frequent or targetable enough to organically build the character you want to play. For example, you might want to obtain weapons that apply a freezing status effect to your enemies and armor that protects against poison to counter a certain enemy type, but you probably won’t have the right items available at your current level to let you create that build. “Maybe they want you to trade with your co-op partners?,” you might be thinking. Nope, there’s no trading system at all! Instead, I just had to work with what I was given, which almost never lined up with what I wanted to do. Crafting isn’t much of a help because its options are equally limited to your random drops and come with significant resource costs that you’ll run dry on if you make use of crafting often (a problem for which the only cure is even more grinding of mindless activities). It’s perplexing to me that non-legendary equipment cannot be upgraded or modified, and even so-called “mods” actually just enhance existing equipment capabilities as opposed to letting you swap in new attributes. The incredible inflexibility of these systems mean that, unless you’re a masochist, you’ll mostly just shrug like I did and say, “Well, my loadout sucks, but let’s go do the mission anyway,” and slog through it. It’s worth noting that there is very little endgame content to warrant building toward. Content runs dry the moment you close the final case file, and you likely won’t ever need to reach the max character level to take on any particular challenge. I’m not sure if Gotham Knights is setting itself up to have a live-service model, a la Marvel’s Avengers (2020), which might justify building out an endgame build to tackle more challenging content, but the RPG landscape would need major overhauls to facilitate that – as of now it, barely squeaks by as a passable system with which to finish the fleeting campaign. Gotham Knights does have a New Game+ option, so you could definitely take your hard-won loadout with you to a tougher version of the campaign… but given how numb my first playthrough left me, I can think of precious few reasons why someone would choose to do so. I’ll say this though: Gotham Knights totally nails gear when it comes to cosmetic customization. It comes with lots of costume options for each hero, and different color schemes available so you can make your outfit your own, including some dope Batman Beyond-themed outfits and other classic costumes pulled from throughout Batman’s colorful history. And if you don’t like the look of whatever armor has the best stats, you can use the transmog system to apply any style you’ve unlocked and ensure you never leave the Batcave looking anything less than suave. There aren’t many things that made me want to return to Gotham Knights after completing the story, but searching for new ways to up my swag game was definitely one of them. If you can conscript someone into joining you after they’ve read this review, playing with a friend is undoubtedly a better experience – and not just because you’ll have someone to show off your outfit to. For one, combat tends to go by much faster with someone else at your side, and pulling off stunts like team attacks where two characters work together to execute a sweet finisher is one of the better things combat has to offer. Unfortunately, many missions feel like they’re balanced specifically for two crime fighters, leaving anyone hoping to treat this as a solely single-player game in a little bit of a lurch. While fighting alone often made me wonder if maybe I needed to grind more first, when I had a friend join my game I usually thought, “Oh, <i>this</i> is why the encounter felt bad before – they wanted me to bring backup.” One example is a fight against some of Harley Quinn’s goons where she sics two beefy bosses on you – I don’t recommend going into that one without a sidekick. There are some weird quirks with multiplayer though, like how slow-motion animations look incredibly awkward to the second player, who’s moving at normal speed. Or when both players grapple hook to the same place, knocking one of them to the ground. Or how you feel very much like second fiddle when in someone else’s game because you don’t appear in most cutscenes, are not allowed to interact with certain objects, and don’t get all the same rewards the host player receives after completing activities. It’s also just super weird that you can only play with a maximum of two players in a game that very deliberately has four playable characters available. I don’t know if the original plan was to include four-player co-op or not, but it never stopped being bizarre to have two heroes caught in a crazy whirlwind of events while two other powerful figures were…off washing their tights or something? In fairness, WB Montreal has <a href=""/gotham-knights/60925/news/gotham-knights-to-get-heroic-assault-a-free-four-player-co-op-mode-in-november""><u>already announced a four-player challenge mode that’s coming at a later date</u></a>, but even then it’ll be separate from the main campaign. Gotham Knights also suffers from performance issues that range from amusing bugs to annoying hindrances, the most grave of which is that the framerate. On the Xbox Series X, a stable 30fps was a rarity, especially when out in Gotham’s open world or during cutscenes – and God forbid I ride on my motorcycle for any amount of time. I’m not one to turn up my nose at a 30fps game versus 60 (which isn’t available here) and generally don’t need a game to be God’s gift to Digital Foundry to enjoy it, but Gotham Knights is pretty rough in this regard. That’s another disappointment when so many other aspects, like graphics, animations, and more, look quite good. Beyond framerate issues, my time in Gotham Knights saw occasional crashes, disconnects during multiplayer sessions, and various bugs from the highly irritating case of a mission target getting stuck in a wall, to silly stuff like riding your motorcycle like such a champ that you glitch through the bottom of the map and fall through the level to your death (losing in-game resources to this is also pretty annoying). I was able to get through it, so I wouldn’t call it completely broken, but it was not a smooth ride. Gotham Knights is a consistently disappointing return to Batman’s troubled city and a distinct step backwards from the past decade-plus of Batman games. Even if running around Gotham in two-player co-op can be decent fun and each of the four playable crime fighters are well executed in their dialogue and distinctive moves, too many of the fundamentals fall short for me to recommend it. From the inconsistent frame rates, to the weak story, to one-note combat that rarely feels good, there was virtually always something going wrong to make sure I wasn’t experiencing the triumphant return with my friends at my side I had envisioned.

Slime Rancher 2 Early Access ,7,"After dozens of hours dedicated to wrangling balls of living goop in developer Monomi Park’s previous life sim, it feels great to be back with Slime Rancher 2 – a sequel that retains all of the original’s stickiness (in more ways than one) and ridiculous charm. It may feel like more of a Slime Rancher 1.5 at its early access release, but its presentation is still a night-and-day improvement over the original, the new slimes and areas are wonderful and unique, and movement and exploration both feel much better. All those upgrades combine to create a satisfying and zen-like adventure that made me want to retire from the rat race of battle royales and action games to settle down on a sticky pasture and live a simple life among the slimes. If you’ve played the first Slime Rancher, even a little, then nothing about this work-in-progress sequel is likely to surprise you. As with the first entry, you’ll run around chaotic and beautiful otherworldly environments as you collect resources and slimes, then head back to your home base to turn your jelly friends into profit just like Ayn Rand intended. You’ll also fight gross, world-consuming Tarr slimes, upgrade your base of operations and your equipment, and fall off cliffs when you forget you don’t have enough stamina to power your jetpack. The good news is that this formula of exploring, farming, and experimenting with your slimes and their crossbred permutations remains incredibly compelling, and it’s easy to lose track of time while hanging out with this lovable gang of invertebrates. On the other hand, Slime Rancher 2 plays it so safe that it took me a while to even notice some of the changes it’s made.  At this early stage there aren’t too many new things added – in fact, in some ways there are actually fewer options than in the previous entry, like a reduced number of unique areas and slimes (something the first game bolstered over its own early access period). That said, most of the slimes that are currently MIA were probably strategically cut fat, and the slimes that have been added are more than fair trades for those we lost; I don’t particularly miss the irritating, radioactive Rad slimes, for example, while the new Ringtail slimes that skitter about killing things and get turned into stone if they get caught in the sun are hilarious little troublemakers. Still, it’s weird that obvious stuff that would have been great to have at launch, like NPCs occupying the world or multiplayer options, have been completely eschewed for now. In its current form, Slime Rancher 2 is fairly light on content in general. I began to feel like I was out of things to do after about a dozen hours, and I encountered areas that were incomplete or blocked off in some of my first moments of exploration. Luckily farming for slimes, gathering resources to upgrade your ranch, and exploring what areas you <i>can</i> access are all such wildly captivating activities that I spent well over that time just optimizing my farm and looking for secrets. You can also get a lot of mileage out of the returning crossbreeding mechanic, which merges two types of slimes together to create interesting and often ill-advised combinations, like the exploding crystal abominations I Frankensteined into existence. That’s a rabbit hole that only got deeper over the course of the first game’s developement, and I’m excited to see if this adventure follows suit. But despite the familiarity, it’s impossible not to notice this sequel’s higher level of polish. If the original was a compelling and memorable proof of concept, then Slime Rancher 2 comes much closer to a final product that benefits from years of fine-tuning – even in this early state. This is most immediately recognizable in its presentation, which has been improved substantially. Slimes have a ton of personality now, serving as irresistibly weird creatures to chase – that includes the new cotton slimes that bounce around and joyously eat all your vegetables, as well as returning crystal slimes that come off as mischievous bullies in this iteration who want nothing more than to break everything in their path. The areas are beautiful and diverse too (even if there are only three of them so far), and the UI, music, sound effects, and lighting make everything easier on the eyes and ears, to the point where it hardly even feels like an early access game on the surface. Really the only issues I ran into were occasional bugs, like the all-too-familiar falling through the floor and seeing under the world thing, but those were easy to resolve with a simple reboot and relatively rare. The movement mechanics also have some notable improvements, making jetpacking around the hub areas more fun than ever. Running around is really smooth and platforming from place to place is more precise (which is a good thing, because it plays a larger role now) even if the woefully tiny stamina meter that shares its energy with your jetpack is still a constant annoyance. And while there aren’t many of them yet, each area is impressively large, has lots of verticality to explore, and even has a few puzzles to solve as you hunt for slimes in the wild. I particularly enjoyed the new lava area that can be found in the Ember Valley, which required more thoughtful platforming and offered more danger than past locations. It’s a little disappointing that the main obstacle they throw at you remains unchanged from the first game though, as you’ll still be overfeeding massive Gordo slimes to unlock new areas and shortcuts. This is certainly a fun little mechanic, but I’ve seen it a lot already and there are few fresh challenges to complete alongside it. The main enemy of Slime Rancher, Tarr slimes also make a return, and thankfully they’re more cruel and intimidating than ever before. Previously, this mob of overfed and corrupted slimes were a fairly uncommon and easily handled danger, but now they’re all over the place, spread almost instantly, and can become a serious problem if they’re let loose in your farm. That said, they still aren’t very threatening to you personally as they don’t do much damage and are easily killed by being thrown off a cliff or splashed with water – or, better yet, just avoided altogether. But since they infect everything around them, they pose a real threat to your precious slime resources and can absolutely defile the land you’re trying to tame. I was happy to see a little bit more challenge added to what I think of as the video game equivalent of a spa day, even if it’s only a minor increase.<a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19GLWrPNHiHBP8jxU2YAxKXZmNEznX2n1?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""></a Slime Rancher 2 is a fantastic and charming life simulator that still has lots of room to grow. It probably won’t surprise anyone who played the original, borrowing quite a lot from its predecessor while inventing relatively little so far, but it continues to be bewitchingly fun all the same. If this is just the beginning, then I fully expect this adorable adventure to evolve into something very special – but for now, it’s just a highly enjoyable start. "
Overwatch 2 ,8,"Is Overwatch 2 truly a sequel? It’s a question that has lingered around the second iteration of Blizzard’s multiplayer shooter ever since its unveiling in 2019, and one that intensified when it was revealed that it will fully replace the existing Overwatch, not exist alongside it. Well, now it’s finally in our hands, and I can say that while it’s less of a reinvention and more of an evolution of the intense, nuanced, and brilliantly colourful team-based battle that made its predecessor so enjoyable, it still brings enough new things to the table that it feels like its own distinct game and not simply Overwatch 1.5. The bigger question, as Overwatch 2 begins to open up to the public as a free-to-play game, is how many of those new ideas are positive changes – different is, after all, not synonymous with better, and there are definite improvements here, just not universally so. I don’t mean to sound too negative – the original Overwatch is genuinely among the most fun I’ve ever had with a video game (and one of only two 10s I’ve ever given at IGN), so a step down from that is still something very enjoyable. Blizzard has simply set an incredibly high bar for itself here.  Because it’s not a radical reinvention, Overwatch 2 still revolves around the exciting, team-based hero shooter gameplay that made the original such a massive hit when it launched in 2016. Its sheer variety in character design across its 35 heroes, the ways in which they each feel unique to control, and the charm bursting from every seam remain clear to see. Everybody’s weapons still feel fantastic to wield, and a full pass to the sounds they produce and a slight visual glow-up only add to the empowering joy of battle. Its highs and lows, from the delight of those last-second tactical switch-ups to the agony of a teammate refusing to step onto the objective at a crucial moment, have yet to be fully replicated by any game since. That rush was the beating heart of Overwatch, but one that unfortunately diminished as it descended into a relatively stale affair near the end of its lifespan thanks to a lack of new content and an abundance of shields leading to a tedious meta taking hold. Some of the changes being made in this sequel act as a defibrillator, though, jolting new life into Blizzard’s hero shooter. Outside of the fact that Overwatch 2 is a free-to-play game, by far the biggest shake-up that comes with the sequel is the move from its traditional 6v6 matches to a smaller 5v5 format. It’s just two fewer players in the arena, but it represents a huge ideological shift in which tangible repercussions are immediately felt. Aside from the potential horror of discovering you were the sixth-best Overwatch player out of your friends and finding yourself the odd person out, it comes with both blessings and curses – it fully drags Overwatch 2 out of the stagnant meta swamp its predecessor found itself in over the past couple of years, but also denies itself some of the lustre of its satisfying team play. Team compositions now consist of two damage, two support, and just one tank character. This means only one of the now 10 playable tank heroes can be in play at a time, whereas in old-school Overwatch, tank heroes were largely divided between main tanks (such as Winston and Reinhardt, who control space and serve as barriers between you and your aggressors) and off-tanks (such as Zarya and Roadhog, whose job is to be more aggressive and disrupt the other team). That line has become less distinct with Overwatch 2, with all tanks expected to play a more active role in the battle. “More active” sounds good, but the problem created here is you still need that defensive anchor when driving home a payload, and so a tank’s role is now awkwardly split. When only one is permitted, a certain amount of responsibility is placed on that player’s shoulders to both spearhead the team and bear the brunt of the damage, despite it also being their duty to protect the objective. In my time playing, this led to a prevalence of Reinhardt being selected due to him being one of the only viable protectors available. It begs the question of where “off tanks” fit in right now. D.Va is undoubtedly one of my favourite heroes to play as, but I feel a certain amount of guilt picking her in Overwatch 2 as I fly off in my neon pink mech to hunt down a Widowmaker, leaving my support teammates vulnerable and without protection as a result. This makes the transition of Doomfist from damage to mobile tank even more confusing as there doesn’t feel like much of a place for him at all in the rotation as of now. Simply put, many of the tanks still feel designed for the Overwatch of the past, not the Overwatch of the present. On one hand, this huge shift in team composition is a thrilling breath of fresh air, and – critically – something significant to set Overwatch 2 apart from its predecessor. It's a true test of skill that promotes aggressive play and gives 1v1 fights more significance than before. The reduction in stun abilities that halt you in your tracks or interrupt powers definitely helps the flow of a match, even if it does mean my beloved Cassidy no longer has his trusty flashbang. On the other hand, Overwatch 2 appears to be moving away from the tactical teamplay that originally made it unique among shooters. It just feels like some of that satisfying, team-centric magic has been lost in the process of shifting to 5v5. While it does mean that attritional shield battles thankfully appear to be a thing of the past, moments like perfectly timed ultimate combos – like when a Junkrat RIP-tire works its way towards a group of helpless enemies caught in a Graviton Surge – are now a rarer sight. Matches often feel much more like sets of deathmatch skirmishes rather than longer tactical battles. Many characters have been successfully reworked to fit into Blizzard’s new 5v5 vision. Orisa, one of Overwatch’s sturdiest defensive heroes, has undergone the most significant philosophical shift in terms of how Overwatch 2 is intended to be played by tank players. Her radical transformation from a reliable anchor to a mobile damage-dealer is evident just by looking at her new skill set, but it is felt even more on the battlefield. The whirling Javelin Spin quickens movement and encourages charging toward adversaries to deal the most damage possible with a primary fire that has been improved to deal more damage at closer range. This is in contrast to how Orisa was traditionally used; in the first Overwatch, she sat further back and acted as an anchor point for other players to barricade themselves behind and rain fire upon their opponents. Nowhere is this change in philosophy more apparent than in the removal of her football net-shaped energy shield. As more and more barrier-wielders were added to original Overwatch over time, frustrations with shield-heavy metas rose. I remember too many times when I’d settle in for a fun evening, only to be met with Bastion and a Torbjorn turret safely hidden beneath what seemed like endless layers of shields. These initial adjustments to Overwatch 2 clearly address this, and thankfully, those multi-shield days feel a distant memory due to the significant reduction in barriers being available to deploy. Of course, outside of reworks, there are new heroes joining the party, too – one from each class in fact, which brings the full roster to an impressive 35 in total (especially so when you consider the original launched with just 21). Sojourn, the newest damage character, is armed with a rapid-fire railgun and offers a fresh and viable alternative to Soldier 76. She doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but her nimble skid and super-jump combo, mixed in with her hard-hitting secondary fire, can be deadly. Kiriko is a ninja healer who shares some of her moveset with the damage-dealing Genji, but in reality, she plays more like Moira or Mercy – dashing in and out of the action to aid teammates and dish the odd headshot out with a kunai. She takes a little time to get used to, but can be very effective in highly skilled hands. My pick of the new additions so far, though, is Junker Queen: an aggressive tank, her abilities really sing when chained together as you swing her axe, throw a boomerang-like knife into someone, and finish them off with a shotgun blast. All three of these heroes are as well designed as you’d expect of Overwatch 2’s pedigree and are packed full of character, from their distinct looks to vibrant voicework. None of these new additional heroes shake up Overwatch 2 in any groundbreaking way – I could easily imagine them fitting into the original – but they are all definitely fun to play. In fact, the roster does seem fairly well balanced at launch, which is quite an achievement when juggling 35 different high-powered characters with half a dozen abilities each. Rarely have I seen one hero dominate a whole match, with each shining at different moments. Some things are seemingly just inescapable, though, with Genji still consistently slashing his way to Plays of the Game across my screen six years later. Beyond the shift to 5v5, a big addition to the sequel is the introduction of a brand-new mode: Push. It’s essentially a game of tug-of-war, with a Baymax-like robot pushing a barrier through a map on behalf of whichever team is closest to him. It’s a bit like Overwatch’s signature Escort mode, but here each team is trying to push the robot to the other team’s spawn point, rather than one team permanently defending and one attacking for the whole match. It does a great job of centralising the fight, with both teams focusing on a shared objective, and the more I’ve played of it, the more it’s grown on me. As with a real-life tug-of-war, Push is largely centred on momentum and thus is very hard to wrestle back once things aren’t going in your favour. This does mean that on those rare occasions when you do manage to turn the tide it feels like a real team achievement, though – a thrill that is so synonymous with Overwatch’s other modes. I can see it becoming a real hit. The maps that accompany Push are all well put together, with the traditional mix of winding streets and tight choke points that Blizzard has always implemented effectively into its arenas. They are all lovingly crafted, with art and sound working in harmony to create little details that build into charm-filled wholes. In truth – apart from the odd exception (Paris, I’m looking at you) – map design has always been something that Overwatch has excelled in. The six new additions that come with the sequel are no exception, with the Rio de Janeiro-inspired Paraíso being my current favourite. Its charming, carnival-themed payload that you navigate to Lucio’s club showcases the joy Overwatch 2’s maps can bring when they fuse both gameplay and character together. Unlike its heroes, which are all present and accounted for in one form or another, not every map has made its way over to the sequel. This is down to the removal of the Assault (or Two Control Point) mode. I understand they had their issues, but as much as anything I’m sad to see the places go, rather than the mode itself, and the fact that these maps aren’t even available in quick play is slightly disappointing. Locations such as the Temple of Anubis and Volskya Industries hold a lot of affectionate memories for many. It’s a shame to think of the balconies of Hanamura, where I spent many a high noon, now lost to time. Also a thing of the past for Overwatch are loot boxes – the long-controversial gambling mechanic that has now been replaced by a more modern battle pass system (costing 1,000 Overwatch coins, or around $10). Each nine-week season will bring with it a new series of tiers to make your way through, unlocking a variety of cosmetics, from voice lines to sprays, as you collect XP. It’s a model very familiar to battle royale shooter fans by now, and one that is undoubtedly fairer to players than loot boxes (even if a tiny part of me will miss that small serotonin hit of a legendary skin flying out of a plastic crate). Blizzard has laid out a schedule by which each subsequent season will bring a new map, hero, or sometimes both to Overwatch 2 in a cadence not too dissimilar from when its predecessor initially launched. Having had a sneak peek at what’s come up in the next few themed seasons, there are definitely some characters, locations, and even ambitious new modes worth looking forward to – with some of the team’s most ambitious ideas yet coming to fruition. It genuinely feels like an exciting time to be an Overwatch fan again, and for that, I’m more than grateful. Given the time to implement all that is scheduled to come to it over the next year, I see no reason why Overwatch can’t reach the dizzying heights that it once did again, if Blizzard plays its cards right. I do have some slight worries about upcoming heroes being part of the premium battle pass tier and not instantly available to all, though. That model pushes that pay-to-win door slightly ajar in the sense that if a new hero is introduced who is particularly powerful or crucial to the evolving meta, then someone can choose to buy their way up the battle pass tiers – something we’ve seen (inadvertently or not) happen with Activision and the introduction of Call of Duty weapons to Warzone. The fact that each hero won’t be available to use in competitive play for the first three weeks of its existence is a fair navigation of this issue, however. Overwatch is a one-of-a-kind hero shooter that is far and away the best of its genre. It offers variety, depth, and style that very few come close to matching. Its four-year-old foundation has been lovingly crafted into the unparalleled multiplayer experience that it offers today. From its now-cherished characters and expertly crafted maps to outstanding sound design and dynamic action, it's a masterpiece of competitive gameplay. Most importantly of all though, it’s never stopped being ridiculously fun after all these years. All of these factors combine to make Overwatch a singularly special shooter, and one that I would recommend to anyone without hesitation.<i> - Simon Cardy, May 19, 2020</i Read the full <a href=""/review/36592/overwatch-review-2020-update"">Overwatch Review.</a On the flip side, it gives the more casual player something to work toward and a reason (outside of the consistently fun action) to keep playing. This sense of progression is further emphasised for new players, as while all of the original Overwatch’s heroes will be free for them, it will take around 100 matches in order to gradually unlock them all without paying. It’s an approach I don’t think is inherently bad, as a roster of this size can be overwhelming to dive straight into and any easing of the learning curve is welcome. Admittedly, my most-anticipated seasonal content is not due until 2023 – that’s the story-centric PvE modes. The promise of more Overwatch lore is what has had me most excited since the sequel’s reveal, and what could truly set it apart from its predecessor. A steady stream of story-led missions fleshing out a world that Blizzard so impressively built the foundations of years ago is a tantalising prospect, and a far cry from scrambling through comic books and animated shorts for scraps of background information. It’s a shame that none of it has made it in time for launch, but it’s still something I eagerly await nonetheless. So if the pertinent question to ask about Overwatch 2 is simply if it’s a fun game, then the answer right now is yes. It’s still a fundamentally great hero shooter, just one that is perhaps not currently operating at the towering height of its powers. Perhaps that greatness will be recaptured over time, as the community provides feedback through our many victories and defeats to come and Overwatch 2 fulfills the promise of its newly rebuilt foundations. Overwatch 2 breathes new life into what was once the sharpest multiplayer shooter around, before it had its edges severely dulled by Blizzard’s attention shifting away. The switch to smaller 5v5 matches ushers in a new brawler age for Overwatch where individual duels take precedence over tactical team play, and crucially, all but a handful of shields have been thrown out of the arena. The new heroes and maps hit the mark, while Push is one mode that could develop into a fan favourite over time. The fundamentals are all set for Overwatch to shine as it once did in the multiplayer shooter scene once again, and the future definitely looks bright with what is set to come over the following months. I can’t review Overwatch 2 on what it could potentially be though, and instead can only judge what’s in front of me at launch – and that is a very fun team-based FPS, packed full of charm and love for the world it takes place in, and one that I can’t wait to lose hundreds more hours playing in. "
urn to Monkey Island ,9,"Return to Monkey Island is the adventure game equivalent of Spider-Man: No Way Home. No, wait, don’t go! Hear me out: most would agree that No Way Home is an excellent, very fun movie – even for a kid who’s never seen the Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield Spider-Man films. But if you have made those movie memories with the Peter Parkers of the past, then No Way Home taps into something more: nostalgia, even eliciting genuine emotion at various points. Return to Monkey Island, which very notably puts series creator Ron Gilbert back in the franchise’s director’s chair for the first time in 30 years, is a similar ride. It's a funny, beautiful, polished, and well-paced story packed with plenty of puzzles that are both hilarious and challenging for anybody who appreciates a good adventure game. And Return wisely offers ""Guybrush's Scrapbook"" in the main menu, as a fun, visual way to recap the previous Monkey Island games that's narrated by Guybrush. But for those like me, for whom the earliest Monkey Island games were a formative part of our gaming youth, this reunion with wannabe pirate Guybrush Threepwood feels like coming home. To this end, I loved the not-so-hidden Trivia Cards scattered around many scenes, testing your knowledge of the franchise.  The most obvious way that Return to Monkey Island differs from its predecessors is in its art style. Gilbert could’ve gone the pixel-art route to pluck some extra low-hanging nostalgia fruit, but instead he’s gone with a much bolder modern look. I’ll admit: I didn’t love it when I first saw it. It’s a jarring departure from the games I love, but then again, so was the first post-Gilbert Monkey Island game, the Curse of Monkey Island, which used a Disney-cartoon-like style that I adored. Return’s art direction is more abstract, but somewhere along the 11 hours it took me to complete the story I grew to love it. It uses a large swath of the color palette, and its over-the-top character design matches Monkey Island’s sense of humor nicely. But while you’d never confuse Return to Monkey Island with any other game in the series at a glance, the delightful music could easily fool you into thinking you’re still in 1991. Composers Michael Land, Peter McConnell, and Clint Bajakian return with another pleasantly Caribbean score, and it goes a long way toward making this feel like a proper return to Monkey Island. The same goes with the voice cast, headlined by Dominic Armato as Guybrush Threepwood, who brings a restrained, straight-man sensibility to a game filled with often-absurd scenarios, though he isn’t afraid to sling a bit of sarcasm when the situation calls for it. Everyone in this world knows Guybrush is a well-meaning mess, but they can’t help but root for this hopeless underdog and be friends with him anyway. Armato’s performance is a big reason why I felt the same way; there’s an innocence to Guybrush that shines through. And what of the plot? Return is set just after Monkey Island 2, but it’s framed in a clever way I didn’t expect. That showed me a new side of Monkey Island: its big heart, which becomes quickly evident in the playable Prelude that I won’t spoil here, and keeps getting called back to throughout. Its overarching story involves – what else – the search for the Secret of Monkey Island, and that quest revolves around Guybrush’s never-ending rivalry with the zombie-pirate villain LeChuck, and their love-not-really-a-triangle with Elaine Marley. In fact, Return obsesses over the foundational mystery far more than any of its predecessors did, and it’s played up to repeated comedic effect. Our decades of wondering if Gilbert will ever reveal the real Secret of Monkey Island is mirrored in the game, with even Guybrush’s wife Elaine musing about why our hero continues to cling to it. In the process, it revisits familiar locations like Melee Island and of course Monkey Island, and takes us to new ones; just as it also brings back familiar faces (like Murray!) and introduces a host of new characters. Shout-out to Locke Smith, who you’ll visit on several occasions and who is well aware that her very name is a pun. An excellent story and memorable characters are just one half of the classic puzzle game equation: the other is a series of puzzles that are both challenging and satisfying to solve, serving as the bedrock of any great point-and-click adventure. Return serves up a hearty helping of them here, always including a thread of comedy running through the traditional question of which item you should use on what person or location at every turn. Solving puzzles is as satisfying a dopamine hit as ever, and the 2022 iteration of Monkey Island has learned to avoid the infamously obtuse “adventure game logic” that so often made people bounce off of the originals back in the day. The puzzle structures and solutions don’t really tread new ground, but none were so abstract as to leave me wondering how the heck I’d have ever come up with the solution once I figured it out. And while nothing ever frustrated me to the point of wanting to quit and try again later with a refreshed mind, I did occasionally get a bit stuck in the mud, as is par for the course in these games – such as when I had to use an “apology frog” to win back the favor of Melee Island’s governor, Carla. So I made use of Guybrush’s always-available hint book here and there, and I quickly learned I didn’t need to swallow my pride entirely before resorting to it. It’s a very welcome evolution of a feature first introduced to the series in LucasArts’s 2009 remasters of Monkey Island 1 and 2, and it feels guilt-free to use because it’s not simply a tome of spoilers like using a walkthrough. Instead, it gives you hints layer by layer, nudging you in the right direction but still preserving the feeling of satisfaction you get from eventually solving the puzzle yourself. Only once, in fact, did the hint book tell me something I genuinely didn’t want to know at that moment. The new To-Do List also helps you keep track of everything you’re currently working on trying to solve without making it feel like you’re being led around by the nose.  After decades of believing that we’d never see Gilbert get to make his Monkey Island 3, I was in no way disappointed with Return’s conclusion. In fact, it moved me, and made clear that Gilbert cares as much about these characters as we fans do. I expected Return to Monkey Island to be funny. I expected it to have good and often-zany puzzles and hilarious puzzle solutions. You can see that in its writing, its acquired-taste art style, and its delightfully upbeat music. But I didn’t expect it to have such heart. Monkey Island has been known almost solely for its comedic prowess over the past three decades, but Return reminded me of why I first fell in love with Guybrush Threepwood in a way that will have me thinking about it for a long time. What longtime fans get out of it is definitely going to be markedly different from what newcomers take away from it, but I can say that Return to Monkey Island meant a lot to me before I ever clicked to start a New Game, and it meant far more after the end credits rolled.

Disney Dreamlight Valley Early Access ,8,"Where other life sims can sometimes struggle to make interesting use of the characters that occupy their towns, developer Gameloft bursts onto the scene shirtless and flexing its muscles like Maui with Disney Dreamlight Valley. Even in its unfinished early access state, this is an irresistible blend of city planning from the likes of <a href=""/animal-crossing-switch-nintendo-switch/34788/review/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review"">Animal Crossing</a> with quests and a progression system more commonly seen in RPGs. All of that is wrapped inside a Disney theme with an all-star cast of adored characters that make it ridiculously hard to put down. Some tedious quests, copious bugs, and an incomplete final act mean it certainly warrants the early access label at the moment, but it’s already all too easy to lose dozens of hours in this magical simulation. Disney Dreamlight Valley’s cozy concept has you rebuilding a village, befriending iconic characters, and getting sorta creeped out by the look in Mickey Mouse’s eyes. You’ll learn how to fish from Goofy and secretly hope he’s your real father, struggle to find space for all the useless items in your inventory that you absolutely cannot live without, and get really bummed out when you visit Wall-E’s world and remember how sad that movie was. Your ultimate goal is to recruit all the memorable and well-written Disney characters to your town and foster friendships with them, complete a sea of fetch quests to unlock new abilities and access to new areas, and become fabulously wealthy enough to build your Disney dream home in the process. If you’ve played Animal Crossing before, you should feel right at home with Disney Dreamlight Valley – though it isn’t afraid to stray from the well-established loop of farming, fishing, and digging that is the bread and butter of its peers.  The chief differentiator is that Disney Dreamlight Valley wisely focuses far less on the actual village-building and item-collecting elements that are dominant in other games. Instead it relies on its most valuable asset: its characters, who stand front and center as the ultimate unlockable to chase. Completing the right quests to finally convince Moana or Ariel to settle down in my neighborhood provided a hit of dopamine that kept me happily sprinting on the grindy hamster wheel for over 40 hours – not bad for early access. You might not expect a Disney nostalgia simulator where you hang out with a sailor duck and chef rat to try to tell a serious story, but Disney Dreamlight Valley makes just such an attempt – and with more success than I anticipated. That story is dizzyingly meta, but so dang clever I’ve gotta hand it to the devs for their creativity. You enter Dreamlight Valley and quickly learn of a mysterious ailment known as The Forgetting that ravaged the place and caused all the beloved characters to lose their memories; a suitably vague premise that initially made me roll my eyes. Then I began to realize that The Forgetting was actually just an extremely on-the-nose metaphor for my character entering adulthood and leaving behind this imaginary world of their own creation. Rebuilding the town and creating bonds with its characters, then, is an attempt to rediscover my character’s childlike wonder, which (not coincidentally) is exactly what I was doing by reconnecting with these Disney characters. I see what you did there, Gameloft. Just about every activity gives you some kind of meaningful progress, whether it be earning money to upgrade the village or Dreamlight that lets you access new areas and realms, all in pursuit of recruiting more characters and advancing your relationships with them. Of course, you can upgrade your house, buy new furniture and cosmetics, and all that familiar stuff, but it’s hard to beat recruiting your favorite Disney character to become your next-door neighbor as far as incentives go. And by spending time with these characters, you’ll build social links that eventually unlock rewards and quests, the latter of which sometimes result in your character gaining some useful new ability like breaking apart giant ice roadblocks or tearing out troublesome tree stumps. It’s a loop so disgustingly engrossing that I found myself putting off bathroom breaks and ruining my sleep schedule as I told myself “I’ll stop after this one last thing,” time and time again. That said, although chasing new characters and leveling up relationships is endlessly enticing, the actual quests themselves can be a little touch and go. Many of them amount to little more than going out and picking some berries, or crafting a piece of furniture, or cooking some food for someone. Those can often feel like busywork that artificially drag out how long it takes you to unlock your favorite character – even if most don’t actually take very long to complete, they’re usually so similar to one another that it gets repetitive. In a few cases though, quests can be genuinely entertaining in their own right, rather than just a means to an end. In one I chased around a magical feather to divine the location of Donald Duck, who was eternally trapped in a spooky, labyrinthine forest, and in another I helped Anna reunite with Elsa by distracting a giant stone troll in Arendelle. Sadly, these interesting adventures are few and far between amid a sea of much less compelling errands. Again, I was going strong for most of my time with it, but the novelty of this treadmill does slow down toward the end of the adventure. Hopefully this is the part that’s still being worked on to justify the early access label, because it currently seems devoid of meaningful ways to progress. That’s a major shock to the system after being so handsomely rewarded up until this point. For example, the final two areas (which cost the most Dreamlight to access) don’t unlock any new characters and feel largely empty compared to previous ones. And although there’s quite a bit of content to chew on at this early stage – eight distinct environments, four realms, and 17 characters at launch – if it gets its hooks into you as designed you can grind through most of that in a pretty short span of time and be left with little to do aside from log in every day to see what Scrooge McDuck is selling at his store. I’m already excited to revisit Disney Dreamlight Valley once it’s out of early access, but whether or not I’ll continue to play beyond this point before 1.0 depends heavily on if the live-service model will be able to output content frequently enough to keep me engaged. That said, no game must be an endless font of entertainment to be a good time, and in its current state it successfully kept me entertained for 90% of the dozens of hours I put into its journey before ending anticlimactically. Aside from that though, there is some seemingly unintentional timegating that happens which really throws a wrench in an otherwise well-built machine. Unlike real-time games like Animal Crossing that limit your daily progress and ask you to log on every day, Disney Dreamlight Valley sagely sets nearly no limits on how much you can play or accomplish in a single sitting… at least, not on purpose. For example, you can mine ore to your heart’s content, and by the time you’ve left the area to sell off your haul and return, you’ll find the deposits replenished and ready to be mined again – the same can be said for fruit on trees, randomly spawned flowers, and more. But then you’ll run into things like a quest that requires you to collect mushrooms and find no good way to get them except by picking a few that only seem to spawn after reset each day. That effectively adds the same obnoxious timegates to an adventure that seems to have intentionally rid itself of those in other areas, which made them even more out of place and irritating. There are other areas where it doesn’t seem to respect your time, such as crops that take way too long to grow, water-based characters that would swim to places I couldn’t reach them, and, most frustrating of all, characters randomly deciding to sleep in their house and lock me out of it for six real-life hours when I just needed to get in there for a minute to complete a quest. And as of this writing, I am still waiting for some of those accursed mushrooms to appear in the only area that spawns them, with no end in sight. As Dreamlight Valley’s redemption arc plays out, you’ll be treated to a fantastic showcase of the colorful worlds and personalities for which Disney is known. Each character is so impeccably recreated and full of life that hanging out with them gave me flashbacks about parts of the movies that I’d long forgotten. Plus, seeing Donald Duck lose his mind and enter a frenzied rage for no reason just never gets old. All the while, orchestral versions of popular Disney theme music plays in the background and had me humming along like a nostalgia-drunk sucker. The only real letdown, where look and feel is concerned, are the environments – they’re surprisingly claustrophobic and poorly textured compared to how great everything else looks. Granted, that issue is almost a hallmark of the genre at this point, but one that never ceases to gnaw at me as I play nonetheless. Less bland are the character-customization and furniture options you use to decorate the town and your home. I suppose it shouldn’t surprise me that there’s a pile of cosmetics to unlock as big as Gaston’s biceps, seeing as it’s the primary method by which Gameloft plans to make a buck off optional microtransactions when it leaves early access, but it’s still an impressive selection nonetheless. (Unless you wanted to make a redheaded character, in which case for some reason you can only give them ginger eyebrows.) Similarly, the ways in which you can decorate the town and your house are numerous and diverse, and exploring the goods offered by Scrooge’s store became a habit-forming ritual each morning. Once it leaves early access sometime next year, Disney Dreamlight Valley will be a fully free-to-play live-service game with microtransactions baked in to support ongoing content. However, thus far this paid content seems to amount to limited-time events that unlock cosmetics as you complete objectives in the same vein as a season pass. Progress within the season pass can be sped up by paying real money for a premium currency, but aside from that there isn’t any content that’s locked behind a paywall, and the Steam page specifically states that it will have “no monetization mechanisms such as a paid Energy system or gameplay time skipper.” At least in this early state, which requires buying the $30 USD Founder’s Pack to get access, I’m impressed by how mild the microtransaction model is. Also, I’m rarely struck by how good a UI feels to navigate, but Disney Dreamlight Valley unquestionably stands out in this regard. Everything is super easy to find and the all-important collections tab details everything from the unlockables you haven’t discovered yet, to clues for certain ongoing quests that you’ll need to reference. With all of that in mind, it has to be said that Disney Dreamlight Valley feels impressively like a finished product for an early access game. The caveat here, though, is that performance is frequently and brutally murdered like Mufasa (too soon?), sometimes resulting in a painful loss of progress. Some issues are minor, like graphical glitches in which the world temporarily freaks out and turns neon colors for some reason, the camera temporarily develops a mind of its own, or the framerate takes a dive under the sea, but I also hit plenty of crashes or broken states that warranted a hard reset and forced me to repeat whatever I’d done since the last autosave – which was 15 minutes of progress in a few of my cases. These issues are a regular occurrence, too, some of which became insufferably so by the time I saw everything there was to see in my magical valley. Disney Dreamlight Valley is an awesome life simulator that flexes its iconic characters to riveting, satisfying effect. Adding these instantly recognizable villagers to your magical kingdom and forging friendships with them through quests is a blast, even when many of those amount to mundane village errands. Even with a ton of bugs and a missing final act in this early access state, spending 40 hours running around with the gloriously beefy Maui from Moana and cooking meals with Remy from Ratatouille was a consistently delicious treat.

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle R ,7,"Since its re-emergence in the anime scene in 2012, JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure has had an upsurge in popularity thanks to its exuberant characters, vibrant worldbuilding, and infinitely memeable moments. In 2013, developer CyberConnect 2 and Bandai Namco released a fighting game based on the long-running manga series to little fanfare. Almost a decade later, a remastered and upgraded version called JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle R looks to make a splash in a fighting game genre that’s become more exciting and crowded in recent years. All Star Battle R comes equipped with some bold new characters, smart updates to the combat system, and a disappointing replacement for the original’s story mode. So in some ways, it succeeds as a celebration of the 35-year history of one of the most exuberant and vibrant anime and manga series out there, but while it remains an entertaining fighting game, its online components still feel archaic in the modern era.   All Star Battle R’s impressive roster spans the entire history of the series - including 10 more fantastical characters than the previous iteration’s already generous 41. Representatives range from Phantom Blood’s Jonathan Joestar and his diabolical adopted brother Dio Brando, to Jonathan’s descendant Jotaro Kujo from the Stardust Crusaders arc, culminating with Josuke from the most recent Jojolion storyline along with allies and foes from every part in between. Trying out each fighter is a joy and exploring the existing lovingly crafted fighting styles with the newly added assist move synergies brings more complexities to combat than possible in the original. Those combined with funny character quirks and interactions fill every match with pleasant surprises. The cherry on top is an update to the Japanese voice cast in All Star Battle R, with actors reprising their roles from the most recent anime adaptations to make these faithful recreations feel complete, and that’s made ample use of in the middle of fights and on each menu screen. All Star Battle R’s Characters come in all shapes and sizes, some of which are not even human! Fighters like the ice-spewing hawk Pet Shop and Stand-wielding doggo Iggy are much smaller combatants than the typical JoJo. Despite their minor stature, their collision detection often matches those who are much larger, making incoming attacks that appear to go over or under the character hit like they were anyone else. It’s not something I am too worried about as a balance issue, but it is worth noting that you might catch some punches and kicks that look a little off. Each era of JoJo has unique abilities and rules for combat, making for battles that are varied and fun to control. Every fighter has a style that fits their placement in the timeline. The first generation of characters, like the Hamon users, can recharge the HH gauge with the hold of a button and use their gauge for stronger special moves. Others have vampiric powers, while those from the Steel Ball Run arc can fight both on and off horseback. It’s wild and wacky, in true JoJo spirit, and that makes matchups exciting. Much of the series’s confrontations gravitate around protective spirits called Stands that act as a second body on the battlefield, and as such, a majority of the cast makes use of this special ability. This may sound a bit homogenous, but characters’ Stands can manifest in assorted and surprising forms, along with differentiating movesets, making every character feel like they have a cool gimmick despite sharing a common battle style.  I appreciate that because, more often than not, learning one character carries over enough information to bridge the gap when trying out another. For instance, no matter who you’re playing as, basic combos are easy to pull off, with light attacks smoothly transitioning into medium and heavy moves. Many of the special attacks are also mapped in similar ways across characters, making it easy to pick up for beginners no matter who they want to try. Speaking of beginners, Easy Beat is a great tool for new players to use to jam out simple combos using only the light attack button – until they learn how to piece moves together on their own, that is. I have had a great time swapping between the characters I love from the anime and then switching to later JoJo heroes and antagonists to see what kinds of wacky gameplay schemes they abide by.  After you’ve taken that smooth onramp to playing All Star Battle R, there are plenty of advanced skills to learn to maximize your effectiveness on the battlefields. For example, battles play out mostly on a 2D plane, but the dodge button allows a character to dash into the foreground or background to avoid an oncoming onslaught; learning to do this is vital to open up counterattack opportunities and punish aggressive advances. Likewise, the more advanced Stylish Evade can turn last-second blocks into a time-slowing dodge, and getting the hang of it requires precise timing and intuition of what the opponent’s next attack may be. Assist characters selected from any roster member can also be called in to provide mixups, extend combos, or save you from a beating you may be taking. Even taunts serve an important function  by draining the opponent’s resource gauge with appropriately timed trash talk. For those looking to get extra fancy, you can also spend a bar of meter to cancel the recovery of moves to either continue combos or make certain moves safe on block, much like a Roman Cancel in Guilty Gear. Learning when and how to use each of these skills is rewarding and drastically extends the depth of strategy and gameplay in All Star Battle R.  JoJo’s exhibits a flagrant disregard for rules - both visual and mechanical - and for that, I truly love it. It can, at times, seem completely alien and imbalanced, but even then, it manages such consummate showmanship, it’s difficult to fault it too harshly. It is by no means a comprehensive, or polished fighting game, but it is a uniquely enjoyable one; exhibiting rare style and creativity in battle, even as it struggles to meet the standards set by other modern fighters. <i>- Vince Ingenito, May 5, 2014</i Read the full <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/05/jojos-bizarre-adventure-all-star-battle-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle (2013) review</a  Because of the timing of All Star Battle R’s release, its visuals are largely based on JoJo creator Hirohiki Araki’s manga art style and is presented with a wonderful comic book aesthetic, including speech bubbles and dramatic comic panels. The colorful hand-drawn textures and impossible poses for each character model are wonderful to look at, even if some of the models and stages are starting to show their age in 2022. Most of All Star Battle R’s offline modes are solid, if unremarkable, but many kept me happily grinding matches for hours. Of course, arcade and one-on-one versus modes are expected in any fighter, and these activities are available here without any surprising elements. However, exciting additions such as a King of Fighters-like 3v3 team battle and support for tournament brackets you can play with up to eight people offer great ways to get together with friends and duke it out in person. These modes should be staples in modern fighting games, and I applaud their inclusion here.  The primary single-player attraction is All Star Battle mode, which features canonical melees and hypothetical dream matches to see which JoJo from different eras would win if they came to blows. What I like most about these fights are the special conditions like giving you and your computer-controlled opponent increases or penalties to attributes like special gauge recovery, defense, or attack power. Certain boss-like characters may also start in a more challenging state, making many of the battles exciting and difficult confrontations to overcome. While All Star Battle mode contains many fights from the JoJo manga and anime, there’s not much to learn here about the plot of the series. Unfortunately, it leaves anybody who’s new to JoJo completely in the dark as to what is happening in the story, who the main characters are, and why these fights are important. The original’s story mode is nowhere to be found here, which means that one of the remaster’s biggest missed opportunities is in the storytelling – or lack thereof. All there is is a glossary filling in some info on important items and characters hidden in the menus, but it serves better as a reminder to lapsed fans than a guide to the greatness of JoJo.  That’s not to say JoJo’s signature flavor is nowhere to be found; it’s alive and well on the battlefield. Explosive super moves known as Heart Heat and Great Heat Attacks unleash devastating combinations that are paired with ridiculous and flashy animations and voice lines. Some of the best of these include Dio pulverizing a steamroller (a classic), Diego transforming into a Jurassic terror, and Akira Otoshi shredding on his guitar while his Stand pummels their foe.  Where things go downhill for JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle R is in its considerably lacking online play. Not only are the standout parts of offline competition missing, like team battles and tournaments, but remote matches are also limited to strictly 1v1 matchmaking without the option for group lobbies. On top of that, while some matches play out just fine online, matches with any network slowdown can turn brawls into a constantly hitchy mess. That’s a real mood killer, especially in an age where online play is more popular than ever, and competing fighting games such as Guilty Gear Strive or Capcom Fighting Collection are flexing a much better online infrastructure with modern rollback netcode.  I wish it were only connection problems, but there are more issues with online play. Entering into a ranked match is an exercise in navigating unintuitive menus, which made the simple task of selecting my preferred character confusing and frustrating. This annoying mode was also responsible for competitions where it lost my customized button scheme simply because I matched up in the 2P position. It’s great to have JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle represented on modern hardware with an improved combat system over its 2013 version. Its online implementation desperately needs an upgrade, though, and the crucial story context from the anime is nearly nonexistent. Still, All Star Battle R makes a strong case for itself in its raucous cast, accessible yet complex combat, and its set of solid – if safe – offline modes. It’s not the best fighting game out there, but for those who’re heavily invested in JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, it’s one we’re glad to have on hand for a good time. "
Steelrising ,6,"You know that one <a href=""/feature/43629/the-best-soulslike-games"">soulslike game</a> that is a decent enough take on the genre, but also has a bit of wonkiness that otherwise holds it back? Sorry, did you think I was talking about <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/28/lords-of-the-fallen-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Lords of the Fallen</a>, or maybe <a href=""/mortal-shell-pc/38915/review/mortal-shell-review-in-progress"">Mortal Shell</a>? Or perhaps you thought I meant <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/15/the-surge-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Surge</a>, <a href=""/ashen/21298/review/ashen-review"">Ashen</a>, <a href=""/vampyr/15591/review/vampyr-review"">Vampyr</a>, or <a href=""/remnant-from-the-ashes/28439/review/remnant-from-the-ashes-review"">Remnant: From The Ashes</a> – or even <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/thymesia-review"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Thymesia</a> from earlier this month? No, in this case I was referring to Steelrising, a French Revolution-themed action-RPG that’s chock full of creepy robots, emotionally unstable aristocrats in powdered wigs, and death screens that tell you you’re dead. The unfathomably weird setting is a delight, but simplistic combat and underwhelming boss fights end up making disappointing use of it. That means in the long list of recent serviceable soulslikes with lots of rough edges, Steelrising is… well, another one of those. Set in a bizarre alternate history version of the French Revolution where Louis XVI has crushed his would-be usurpers using monstrous robots, you play as Aegis, a stoic dancing robot turned lone warrior who has to face the king’s mechanical army. Everything about the setting is incredibly weird in the best possible way: all the robo-folk take design cues from old school clockwork machines of the time period, you spend a lot of time hanging out with actual French revolutionaries like Lafayette and Robespierre, and Marie Antoinette herself serves as your boss and chief quest-giver, which never stops feeling super strange (but I’m into it). The roughly 15-hour campaign tells a pretty predictable “down with the king” story that has you turning increasingly dangerous metal machinations into scrap, but the peculiar setting and characters help make that journey mostly enjoyable.  The hit-or-miss voice acting for its historical figures is shored up by some great writing and interesting side missions as you assemble a group of renegades to help you fight the king. For example, a charismatic revolutionary will ask you to help him in his fight to end slavery, and a side quest later on lets you rob the king’s treasury and then decide which of two opposing political causes you’d like to use those funds to support, complete with dialogue options to pick from. Some of these decisions affect the outcome of the story in major ways, which was a welcome surprise in a genre that usually relies heavily on cryptic environmental storytelling. Plus, Steelrising isn’t afraid to touch on some interesting philosophical and political topics like dictatorships, the consequences of bloody insurrections, and some surprising late-game story developments that I won’t spoil here. Cutting down robots is fun and all, but I quite enjoyed taking a break from the action to debate politics with my French compatriots from time to time. Between those moments, Steelrising does still place most of its focus on the tried and true recipe of fighting your way through areas filled with deadly enemies in hopes of reaching the next save point before eventually killing a big, scary boss. All the expected chords are struck here, including respawning enemies when reaching save points, losing your primary resource upon death (called “anima essence” in this case), and third-person hack-and-slash combat that has you dodging around and using limited consumables to recover health. It’s a formula that’s all too familiar, and although I’m a fan of soulslikes, it’s still a bit eyebrow-raising how remarkably little this iteration does to set itself apart from all the other options we have nowadays. An unoriginal idea can still be executed in exciting ways, but Steelrising doesn’t completely nail some of the game mechanics it tries to replicate either. Combat is a fairly one-note contest of dodging and slicing with a few status ailments, special moves, and weapon types thrown in to jazz things up. There are certainly some interesting weapon options, many of which have special abilities associated with them that might let you block or fire a weapon from afar in addition to its melee strikes. That includes the fire chain, which lets you ignite enemies from a distance in style, as well as the nimble glass-core batons, which I relied on extensively to freeze and then wail on my enemies. However, swinging those weapons is frequently imprecise, and combat can feel downright janky at times as a result. The all-important dodging mechanics feel smooth and responsive at least, but enemies often waddle around and simply let you kill them, and I sometimes got stuck on pieces of the environment at the worst moments. Plus, the age-old problem of a terrible camera that floats through objects and obscures your view is likely to cause issues on a regular basis. The robotic opponents you fight along the way come in a few creative varieties, from small and weak humanoids to enormous foes that carry around building support columns as weapons. There are also some cool robotic dogs, freaky snake-like creatures, and even some murderous musicians who kill you with brass instruments like you’ve always dreamt they would. Each of these enemies has their own bag of tricks to learn, and facing off against them initially accounts for some of Steelrising’s best moments. Unfortunately, once you’ve fought these motorized baddies a few times, you won’t find many surprises ‘round the bend. There just aren’t many types beyond what I’ve mentioned here, with most others being slight variations of one another that hardly impact how you approach different combat scenarios. Bosses are even worse as many are just beefier versions of existing enemy types – the much more unique “Titan” bosses do provide a boost of variety, but they’re so laughably easy to defeat that you’re likely to wipe the floor with one and then not think about it again. Steelrising never really falls entirely flat on its face in any of these attempts, so the things it <i>doesn’t </i>try to do are what really what take it from passably enjoyable to underwhelming. Its alternate history theme is exceptionally creative, but it seems so afraid to break from the soulslike script elsewhere that I practically started recognizing sections from other games. There were times when I would walk into a room and instinctively know an enemy was going to lunge out at me from the ceiling, or that I would find an item hidden in a dangling bag I had to strike. That familiarity means there aren’t any real surprises to be found, and the adventure ends up largely feeling like it’s trying to parrot stuff I’ve already played rather than chart its own course. Those levels also try their hand at a bit of platforming, as you unlock a midair dash and a grappling hook that you’ll sometimes be required to use to get through levels, but this addition is unfortunately not very well executed either. For one, the camera issues often mean you’ll get turned around while dashing through a tight gap or be staring up at a grappling point hoping it decides to lock on to the spot you’re trying to leap to – an issue that’s much more frustrating if you’re being mobbed by nearby enemies. But Steelrising seemingly doesn’t actually want to trust you with these abilities either, as it sometimes locks you out of areas you should theoretically be able to access using these powers. For example, if you find a spot to dash over a wall and the developers have arbitrarily decided you shouldn’t have access to that place yet, you’ll run into an invisible barrier. This completely took the steam out of my engine every time it happened to me, as it makes things feel needlessly linear. That’s a bummer when its hub worlds are otherwise a lot of fun to explore. As you travel around various areas of France, you’ll be treated to some really cool sights, including a few notable places like the Bastille or Versailles – all of which have gone full-dystopia in light of their current automaton occupation. Even when some of Steelrising’s rough edges hampered the experience, the sprawling historical settings continued to impress. I got to fight my way down the ruined cobblestone streets of 1789 Paris and murder a giant robot’s dumb face in the courtyard of a gorgeous castle, and that’s not a bad way to spend an afternoon. Of course, it wouldn’t be a by-the-numbers soulslike if it weren’t also prone to some bugs, and Steelrising has plenty to share with you. During the course of my adventure I got stuck on invisible objects, stopped being able to see enemy health bars for hours at a time, and even crashed to the Xbox dashboard at times (presumably because it just couldn’t handle my combat prowess). None of these issues are so rampant that I wanted to rage quit, but they certainly don’t do any favors for a game that already feels unpolished at times.  Steelrising is a competent action-RPG with an unforgettable setting, but it’s dragged down by its humdrum soulslike formula that doesn’t do anything to make its combat or exploration stand out. Despite having some memorable weapons and enemies, combat often feels imprecise or sloppy, and boss fights are largely forgettable. That said, even if the story is fairly straightforward, the recognizable faces from history you meet and the beautiful French vistas you find them can still help make fighting robots in an alternate history somewhat entertaining.

F1 Manager 2022 ,8,"A good sports management game shouldn’t just accurately represent the sport on the cover; it also needs to show some personality. It needs to be a storyteller. In any sports organisation – as time, championships, seasons, and people come and go – their story grows and changes, building a folklore and a history that makes them unique and loved by their fans. It’s what gives them an identity. F1 Manager 2022, despite being a first attempt at the genre by Frontier Developments, is definitely a storyteller; one that will help you shape the future and history of any current Formula 1 team into one of your own making. Despite its quirks and the fact that it’s missing some features that experienced sim fans might expect, F1 Manager 2022 is more than worth the long, 22-year wait since EA’s similarly named, but unrelated, F1 Manager.   Gameplay is split between two main themes: the race weekends, and the management screens in between them. The latter is where you’ll field emails, start design and manufacturing projects to help improve the performance of your car, manage your race team staff and drivers, upgrade and do maintenance on the team’s facilities, and more. It’s certainly got a learning curve and can feel a little fumbly at first, but the impact of your choices feel immediate. Then it’s off to the excitement of the race weekends, which see you jetting around each of the 22 circuits that make up the Formula 1 World Championship, managing your cars and drivers through practice, qualifying, and the race itself. Moving between race weekends and the factory feels good, too, with the post-race analysis acting as a nice moment to decompress after the excitement and stress of managing a team through a Grand Prix. The opening few screens in F1 Manager 2022 can feel overwhelming to begin with, which isn’t unexpected in any management game – but it’s especially true for one that’s wrapped in the fast-paced world of Formula 1. There’s an abundance of icons and sub-menus to dig through where you’ll find enough data to satisfy even the most passionate of bedroom analysts and engineers. It gets very deep into the weeds, but none of it feels like filler; every screen has something useful you can use to help make informed decisions about where your team needs work, like in the car parts screen where you can view a detailed analysis of your cars’ raw performance numbers with new and old parts, or see its expected place on the grid compared to the other teams. It doesn’t throw you straight into deep and prolonged explanations of what you’re looking at either, unless you go digging for them. Instead, it helpfully grabs you by the hand from the beginning and offers you a simple path forward to a race weekend, which is where the majority of your time in F1 Manager 2022 is spent. After the first race is where you’re encouraged to look around some more, with each screen briefly but helpfully explained through a fully-voiced tutorial.  Race weekends are busy and lively affairs, with three one-hour sessions of practice followed by another three sessions of elimination qualifying – and then, finally, the race. Sprint races, a format introduced to the real-world series in 2021, are sadly missing, and it’s disappointing they’re not included given how they’ve shaken up the qualifying format since their introduction. Each session can be run in real time if you’ve got a few hours to burn, but you can also fast-forward time up to 16x speed to move things along in the quieter sessions. It can be tempting to lean on this a lot during a dull race – especially because it is so good about slowing everything down when your attention is needed – but I urge you to slow down a bit because you’d be missing half the fun in skipping ahead. When your drivers are out on the track, there are three different views that give you more information than you’d find on the Ferrari pit wall. There’s the Strategy view, where you can see data on the state of the track, the condition of the car and all of its critical parts, the weather conditions, and the predicted weather for the remainder of the session. Weather plays a huge part in Formula 1 race strategy, and predicting which tyres you should have on and the best time to stop and change them can gain you a huge advantage in a race. That said, it could be better at pointing some of these options out dynamically, either by suggesting things directly or analysing those opportunities after the race so you can be better at spotting them.  Then you have the Data view where you can dig into the finer details of sector times and tyre stats and other various statistics from the current session. This section is more informational than anything, offering an overloaded picture of everything that’s happened in the race up until that point. It mostly comes in use alongside the Strategy view for working out gaps between the cars you’re racing, and seeing the chances of other teams taking an extra pit stop. There’s almost too much on display here, and it needs some kind of customisation so you can really focus in on the details you need at that moment. Lastly, but most importantly, the Race view lets you tap into the various cameras placed around the track, as well as the onboard cameras available on each car. It’s where you’ll watch the majority of the on-track action as it happens. You can direct your drivers when to push or save their tyres and manage fuel and ERS battery use, and while this can feel a bit overkill to begin with, it makes a lot more sense when in the context of a race. If you notice one driver is pushing their tyres too hard, order them to back off and you can avoid a costly late race pitstop. It doesn’t feel like you’re coaching your drivers, but rather gently advising them on how to maximise their chances – and miraculously, this never falls into feeling like micromanagement. Each circuit feels lovingly recreated from their real-life counterparts, from the sun-drenched desert surrounding the Bahrain International Circuit and the glinting seas and packed-out harbour that laps the shores of the Circuit de Monaco to the brand-new tarmac of the Miami International Circuit, under the shade of the Hard Rock Stadium in the Miami Gardens. Track and weather conditions also look great; clouds roll in and cast shadows over the track when rain threatens to dampen proceedings, and day noticeably turns to night during late afternoon sessions with the bright-orange sun brilliantly washing the ground in harsh light as the circuit lights slowly take over. Despite some excessive blooming and a few flickering artefacts here and there, it’s both impressive and immersive enough to pull me into the action on screen. On track sessions are mostly well-presented thanks to both the impressive cars and tracks and the surprising detail of using the same TV-style camera placement as they use at the real-life races. On the other hand, the accompanying commentary from Sky Sports F1 presenters David Croft and Karun Chandhok leaves a lot to be desired. Both of them come off sounding like they’re reading through forced smiles while under duress, though mercifully these scenes can be skipped and you can dive straight into preparing your cars for your first session. On that subject, it’s a shame there’s no media or fan interaction to speak of, given how important the relationship a team has with its fans can be when determining sponsorships, team morale, and more in real life.  Any practice or qualifying session can be left in the hands of your team, and they’ll handle all the necessary race preparation work. However, taking control of practice yourself will help you find that extra bit of performance that your team usually can’t. In the garage, the simple slider system means you don’t need a mechanical engineering degree to see what changes you’re making and how they’re affecting other things, with your driver's feedback also clearly visible. Each change is a compromise to something else and finding the right balance is key to extracting the best performance; seeing the payoff in performance is more than satisfying enough to make it worth the time. With its typically deep and rich career mode and its usual class-leading spectrum of assists and difficulty options, F1 22 maintains this series’ run as the most fully-featured and accessible reproduction of a single modern motorsport on the market – and long-awaited tweaks to some of its most reused elements haven’t gone unnoticed, either. It’s not quite as bold as F1 2021, though, and the footwear-and-furniture-focussed F1 Life mode really isn’t a patch to cover the lack of last year’s ambitious story mode. <i>- Luke Reilly, June 30, 2022</i Read the full <a href=""/f1-22/57761/review/f1-22-review"">F1 22 Review</a  As the late former voice of Formula 1, Murray Walker, once famously said, “Anything can happen in Formula 1 and it usually does,” and F1 Manager 2022 brings that same level of excitement and uncertainty, albeit in its own unique and sometimes awkward way. The racing action can be just as thrilling to sit and watch as a real race, although it can veer into “Hot Wheels with your brother” territory when you see cars softly park themselves in the barrier, or when there’s an almighty smashup under a shower of sparks and debris before both cars roll away back to the pits like their drivers didn’t just have the biggest accident of their lives.  But the almost slot-car-like AI racing on display still produces the same storylines and on-track rivalries we see in real life, and it's here where F1 Manager 2022 finds its stride. Is your driver faster than the cars in front but stuck in a DRS train? Why not pit them a little earlier, giving them a tyre advantage and see if they can leapfrog them during the pitstop phase of the race? Or perhaps you’ve noticed there’s some rain on the way and want to gamble on going to wet tyres before anyone else. As different race strategies unfold and events take place, watching the field shuffle about with drivers jostling for position and scouring through the data screens looking for any kind of advantage is a real thrill, particularly when a risky strategy call pays off. F1 is full of unique sounds, and F1 Manager 2022’s audio feels nicely authentic thanks to some awesome trackside and onboard engine sounds, plus the inclusion of real driver and race engineer chatter for some added immersion. During any session each race engineer will communicate with their driver, providing feedback on car setup, track conditions, and any incidents happening in their path. Pierre Gasly swears and shouts down the radio whenever his tyres are nearing the end of their life, while Alex Albon’s awkward charm comes across even in short spurts of radio banter. Even its roster of Formula 2 and Formula 3 junior drivers, who will replace the eventually ageing F1 field as they near retirement in later seasons, have some voiced radio. While there’s not as much variety for each as I’d like – it can get annoying when they use the same complaints over and over again – hearing the real drivers' voices adds a layer of authenticity that I didn’t know I wanted until I heard it. When the dust settles on a race weekend you’ll head back to the factory to decompress and look ahead to the next race, as well as anything else that can get done before you’re off to another full weekend. This can range from checking your spare parts in the warehouse to ordering emergency parts to be built before the next grand prix, starting research projects on improving next year’s car, and a lot more.  How you go about this will be mostly dictated by the stature of the team you start your career with. A team like Williams, for example, has the worst car, is resource poor, and needs better staff and facilities before you can start thinking about bolting on new parts for increased performance. Here you might look to first improve the base facilities to give the team some much-needed development and performance bonuses to build confidence, or maybe invest heavily into next year’s car so you can start challenging for points positions instead of battling away for pride in the lower half of the field. Whereas a team like Red Bull already has a car it expects to challenge for the championship with, so you can focus all your resources on gaining all the extra performance you can find. Despite all aiming for the same ultimate goal of winning, it’s refreshing to know that each team will require a unique touch to progress.  Everything you do in F1 Manager 2022 is to please the almighty board, who sit upon high in their fancy-shmancy board room and set your expectations for both the following season and longer-term goals they'll want you to have achieved at some point in the future. You can get away with failing to meet your goals for a little while but, like any boss, if you let them down for too long and fail your board reviews they’ll bring down the hammer: you’ll be given less and less budget to play with before being asked to leave the building and find a new job. The opposite is also true; impress them enough and your budget will soar, opening up new avenues of investment for you to explore.  Money doesn’t solve every problem, though. Once you’re near the top and pulling in the big bucks F1’s cost cap regulations reign in overspending, so forget about throwing your abundance of millions at any one problem. Upgraded facilities aren’t bulletproof – they degrade over time and lose effectiveness, needing costly refurbishing to bring them back up to standard. If you’ve got crash-happy drivers, emergency spare parts can quickly churn through a limited budget. This beautifully twists what would normally be a huge advantage of having all the cash in the world into another point of tension, so you can never truly get too comfortable with your progress.  Key staff will helpfully monitor and report through emails on their areas of responsibility so you’ll never miss out on important information, like when the design team has finished work on a new part or when you have a driver that will soon be out of contract. They can also help you decide which direction to take car development, identifying weaknesses for improvement. But when it comes to making and acting on these key decisions you’re given free reign to accept or ignore this advice as you please. The comparison data for every car on the grid is there, which is admittedly a little unusual given how secretive F1 teams really are, but I appreciate that you aren’t led down any certain path. There’s no one right way to the top, and F1 Manager 2022 feels like it strikes the right balance between guiding novices in the right direction while not standing in the way of those who want to forge their own path to glory. Even after my worst race results, where everything fell apart at the seams despite having what I felt was a concrete strategy and top-line drivers, I never walked away from a session in F1 Manager 2022 without a dumb smile on my face. Sure, sometimes the racing can look a little robotic and there are some key facets of modern F1 racing that are missing entirely, but this never detracts from the thrill of watching my drivers cross the line for some hard-earned points or their first-ever podium. The excitement and thrill of Formula 1 is here in spades. "
